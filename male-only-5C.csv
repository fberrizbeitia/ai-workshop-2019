-4;"I stay in an awful lot of hotels. Probably 50+ a year through work and personally. This one has become my number 1 in terms of badness that I've had the pleasure of gracing!  I stayed there with my fiancée and parents for one night in December and from the word go, it was basically a catastrophe.  Firstly, my mum called the hotel the day before our stay to reserve a table for dinner for when we got there, only to be told that it wouldn't be necessary because it was a quiet evening. When we did get there, we were fairly bluntly told by the waitress that there wasn't any tables because they had a big function on! Now, surely this would have been known about the day before when the call was made?! My dad pointed out that there were at least 2 empty tables to which the staff suddenly agreed and threw them together so that we could all sit together.  When we did eventually manage to sit down and order, on two occasions the waitress had to come back and say that something we had ordered was not available. 45 minutes after ordering our food and drinks, my dad had to go and find out where our actual drinks were because by this time we were getting very thirsty! They did the old &quot;they were just coming sir&quot; as the waitress ran to the bar to get them sorted. Basically, they had forgotten! My dad's food then arrived half an hour later...several minutes then passed before ours appeared. My mum had a fish thing whilst myself and my fiancée had a mixed grill. Upon taking her first bite, my mum noticed something in her dinner. She inspected only to find a large piece of plastic wrapping from the fish, still in her dinner! Clearly, the fish was not cooked as fresh and was basically a boil in the bag jobby which for the money you are paying, is appalling! Both the mixed grills were cold as well so all three meals were then sent back! We ended up getting the duty manager to the table to explain and there was then an awful lot of franticness trying to resolve it. We had 2 waitresses serving our table; one of them was very polite and did seem to try and take command of the situation whilst the other basically downed tools and ran away! We weren't being mean, we just wanted hot food which was free of any foreign objects! The thing that also really annoyed me was that the excuse of &quot;We have a lot of people in tonight&quot; kept being thrown about. This to me is no excuse whatsoever. If you offer people the chance to have a conference or an event at the hotel, you should be able to cope. And at no point should you ever offer that as an excuse. We we're planning on having pudding but it turned out that most of them were also unavailable so we gave up.  The rooms themselves looked ok but in reality really weren't. The bed was dreadful and the room had a funny smell. Something reminiscent of how the drains smell after a period of time with very little rain. We woke up in the morning desperate for a nice shower to wash the previous day away only to find that there was absolutely no hot water on our floor! Annoyed and tired, I called reception who said that there was water on the first floor. After a minute trying to explain that it was great having water on the first floor, but no good to us on the third floor, we were told that we could go to an unused room on the first floor to shower if we so wish. I accepted and a few minutes later a key was brought up to our room for another on the first floor. We got to the room to find that it had clearly just been checked out of and was pretty dirty. The sewer smell was even worse in this room. I went to have a shower and the water pressure was quite frankly, pathetic. I could probably have sweat with more pressure than the shower so although the water was slightly warm, having a shower was a near impossibility. My fiancée found it twice as hard because she has long hair so trying to wash it was laughable at best!  Once we had &quot;showered&quot; and got dressed, we went down to breakfast. The same waitress who had run away from our table the previous night greeted us and you could see she was massively disinterested. I think her total lack of English didn't help the situation either and that is something that annoys me hugely about any hotel. If your in England, the very least you should expect is English speaking staff! So, we sat down and at no point were offered any tea or coffee. We went to look at the buffet and basically had a choice of some cold baked beans, ropey looking bacon and some blueberry muffins. Nothing else. I took a muffin and sat down, by this point about to explode with frustration. Eventually we managed to summon another waiter to ask him for some tea and coffee. We did manage to actually get it fairly quickly! We also asked if there was any possibility of some toast, to which he replied &quot;no, the chef is on a break so we can't get you any toast!&quot; I mean seriously, does it really take a chef to make some toast?! I could cook toast when I was 4 years old without much trouble! I offered to then go and make the toast myself and eventually the waiter himself decided to go and have a crack. He did also say that instead of toast, they could offer us some bread...! Wow.... When the toast did come out, it was basically warm bread anyway so maybe you do need a chef to cope with the unenviable task of making some toast at the Palm Hotel...!  We gave up with breakfast and hurriedly checked out, keen to put as much distance between us and the hotel as possible!  Another small point is the parking is dreadful. A very small car park and no (that I could see) disabled spaces which means that you are forced to park down one of the side roads surrounding the hotel. We had to park a good 200m from the hotel which is a huge problem for my elderly father who has problems walking, especially when it is absolutely chucking it down with rain like it was that night.  All in all, an absolutely dreadful hotel experience, one that I wouldn't wish on the most serious of criminals."
-4;" I have just stayed here for the weekend. 3 nights in total. Thurs - Sun for a wedding. Sadly I am far from impressed. The hotels exterior and grounds are beautiful but sadly just a mask for the shambles inside.  Our room was small, dated and dirty. Our shower handle was broken, as in completely snapped off, making the shower unusable. Not acceptable and the room should not have been used until fixed.The bath taps were also broken, meaning we could only ever run boiling hot baths during our stay. There was no fridge in our room and the bed frame was on wheels and not fixed to wall meaning we were swinging all over room from the slightest movement, we paid for a room not a boat. Overall the room was poor and extremely over priced for what they are offering. I have stayed in travel lodges for a fraction of the price where my room was twice the size and offered a far better range of facilities.  The staff, well, where do I even begin. Customer service and satisfaction is obviously not something they strive for. All were extremely rude and arrogant, forever looking down their nose at you. The smallest thing you ask was such an effort and chore, not great given their rates. Our party had hired a room on the Thursday evening and were told to leave come 9pm..  They had over booked some of our wedding parties room on the wedding night including bridesmaids, amateur move and shockingly poor service, no apology, no ownership, acting like its a common mistake and to get over it. Not that they have ruined the ending of an extremely special occasion and upset and distressed many people in the process.  To top it off they tried to charge us 2 extra meals at the hotel that we did not have, one of which we were at the wedding not at the hotel so physically impossible. mistake or cheap trick to con? MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BILLS ON DEAPRTURE is my advice if you make the mistake of staying at this hotel.  The breakfast was good but the restaurant manager in the morning could not wait to get you out quick enough.  Drinks at the bar were expensive and ques were big.  I would avoid this hotel at all costs, especially if its a special occasion which you don't want ruined. They lack any form of ownership and a brick wall would have given me better customer service. It just seems a complete shambles, over booking rooms that were made 8 months in advance, adding extras on to bills and staff that can not wait to get rid of you. No apology for a monumental mistake on their behalf that seriously upset and distressed people unnecessarily on a very important day. &quot;we overbook because not all people usually turn up&quot; was along the lines of their response..   I would have got a much better room and far better customer service staying at a Travelodge for a fraction of the price so my advice is to avoid like the plague and book elsewhere. "
-4; I booked this hotel via an online website and immediately cancelled the booking after realizing I had made a mistake with the booking dates. Unknown to me the small print of the booking conditions stated that the full amount will be taken on booking and is non-refundable. The Hotel refused to refund the money to the credit card used and by looking at the majority of the reviews for this hotel I can see why they need to grab every penny they can. 
-4;They have 2 function rooms so when the music starts you can not fail to hear it! Asked to be moved but full and uninterested. Horrible nights sleep. Getting the Manager's name was a task, perhaps we know why now. Their compensation - come back again and we'll upgrade you - no thank you, it was a spoiled anniversary.
-4; This is Hilton at its worst, not decorated for years just a quick flash up here and there, dated rooms and furniture, poor repairs, marks on walls worn decor.  Off to the the bar for food, prawn cocktail out of stock, beer had yeast in the bottom of glass, now these are basics. Food was average and the salad had a stored in the warm look about it.  The only positive is the staff , polite and helpful and dealt with my complaint over the beer with speed and charm, they replaced the drink and took the cost off the bill.  If you want Hilton standard staff excepted you will not get it here, the whole place is tired and grubby, even the gardener has been laid off by the looks of the rear garden which is the view from my room. 
-4; I was booked in here for a meeting nearby by a company. The room is the smallest I have ever stayed in. I feel like Harry Potter! The room was marketed as a double yet couldn't have fitted a double bed in. Three quarter at best. At £215 a night this is a joke. Would not recommend to anyone. To cap it all lift was broken and I was on top floor but I don't suppose anyone can mitigate against this. It only only contributes to my negative feeling about this place. Avoid! 
-4; Good location, attentive staff, but needs freshening up, tiered looking. I was given the room in the basement, which was tacky in its decor. Not good value at all for £200 a night. Will avoid next time I'm in London. 
-4;We stayed one night as the hotel location is great for catching an early Euro Tunnel train. The hotel is very old and the room was incredibly hot and stuffy - I'm not sure why as the radiator was off in the room. There was no air-conditioning and a noisy roof mounted 4 blade fan did little to help. We were on the 4th floor facing the sea and when we opened the window we had road noise, seagulls and pigeons and fishermen talking until 2am. The disco carried on until the early hours and with an early start we unfortunately had a terrible nights sleep...
-4; Visited mid week with my gym kit, only to find the hotel undergoing significant renovation and thus no gym, no pool, lots of areas out of bounds......um, never said this on the website and even the in house TV channel promotes the 'closed' gym! Felt misled, let down almost cheated.....and at over £100 a night this is not good at all. My advise? Don't trust this hotel until you have spoken to the manager and clarifies exactly what the hotel has to offer. Not what I expected from a Crowne Plaza, bit more like Clown Plaza. 
-4; We had the worst experience ever when we stayed in one of the so called Executive suites recently. After having a lovely meal at the restaurant which I can't fault we went back to our chalet to sleep. We were woken at around 2.30am by excessive noises from above i.e ' loud talking, people walking around, slamming doors and the television blaring. At around 3.30am I phoned reception to complain and they said they would have someone walk over and have a word. It went quiet for 15 minutes then started again only this time the jacuzzi was increasing the noise levels and I phoned reception again. Finally when we were completely exhausted we got up and left. On leaving keys at reception at around 6.00am we were asked if we weren't staying for breakfast and we told the man that we were having to go home to get some sleep ! My partner sent an e-mail complaint to the Manager who replied saying there was nobody booked in above us so they couldn't offer a refund. Although we can't prove it we have our suspicions that maybe staff were using the room above us but we were made out to feel like we were lying. This was positively the worst night anywhere we have stayed throughout the world and certainly won't be repeating the experience. The restaurant we would still be happy to give our custom to but would advise anyone else to do as we will do in future - book into the Premier Inn across the road if you want to have a drink - and a quiet night's sleep. No Stars for this place - they just didn't deserve any. 
-4; Best Western's slogan 'The Price is Right', must refer to the price being right for the hotel management, certainly not for the poor customer….I was recently charged £5.30 for a double espresso in the Best Western Palm Hotel, Hendon, around the cover in a similar hotel the same coffee would have cost me £1.70. The price certainly isn't right for the customer, thats for sure! 
-4; Used to come here a lot years ago. Made the mistake of coming back. The reception and corridors looked tired. My room felt dusty, was not properly cleaned, needed a refurb. The shower was broken. Won't be returning. 
-4; my wife and I were taken to the hotel for a birthday high tea the service was shocking the tea was cold the cakes were stale and uneatable the sandwiches were shocking and also very stale altogether it was a very unhappy afternoon my daughter who booked this tea for us was very upset we will never return to this hotel and never recommend it and by way it was very dear and a complete waste of good cash thank you. 
-4; The description doest match what you get! The pictures are not the same as the rooms, and a view of a car park next to the staff entrance is not the greatest. The rooms were deeply average and if you are hoping for their all singing all dancing promised showers - think again! They don't exist! Bedding was not tucked in and under sheet was in such a mess that when you got into bed all the bedding ended up in a scrunched pile underneath you.   There are no instructions to open the window and no change to the heating so the room was airless and stuffy.   As for breakfast - this was pretty terrible - cheap ingredients, plastic bread, microwaved tomatoes and orange juice which as 90% water when it came out and indifferent staff, made for one of the worst and unfriendly experiences.  The view is nice and its prime location, and the pool was good to use,   As for the price and the star rating - there is no way that this is 4* and I have had better breakfasts in a transport cafe. Massively over priced and overrated.   Hayling Island is a beautiful place and I would encourage you to visit, but I would encourage you to stay anywhere but here. It will be better value! 
-4; Tophams is on a quiet street a stones throw from Victoria. The reception is fine, a bit ornate for my taste but couldn't complain. I booked via Lastminute as the trip was, umm, last minute and my usual haunts were booked.  All started Ok, pleasant reception people, they do take £25 off your card for 'incidentals' but this isn't charged if there aren't any, whatever they are. The fun started when they pulled out a manky old key and called for a smiley young lady. Now some people seem to have been given some spiel about rooms being refurbished, I wasn't, it was obvious this was always the plan. So young lady takes me out the front door, down the street and into some other rooms which, I imagine, is what a bail hostel is like. The room was large enough but there was no mains lighting, just two small bedside lights, one of which didn't work. It was impossible even with the bathroom door open and that light on to see anything in the gloom. Even so it was obvious it hadn't seen a lick of paint for decades.  She pointed to what seemed to be a wardrobe but was in fact the bathroom. This was no bigger than a Ryanair onboard loo but remarkably managed to fit in some loosely described shower as well as the usual.  There was a 8 inch step up the wall into a doorway so narrow I could only get through sideways and then remain sideways to get to the basin. The shower was some kind of Heath Robinson device which, once I had figured it out delivered a 'spray' similar in pressure and temperature as being gently spat on by an asthmatic kitten. At the same time, the shower curtain clung to my every curve leaving me wrestling like Houdini with some kind of plastic straight jacket.  You could if you wished, easily have a 'shower' whilst sitting on the khazi and quite honestly I would recommend this to save having to spend too much time in there.  The room itself was cold, the bed as uncomfortable as I have slept in and there were no extra pillows or blankets. I didn't check the mattress for stains like some other reviewers and quite honestly I'm glad. Oh, and no spoons for the luxury of a small kettle, tea bag and uht milk. But you couldn't see when the tea was mashed anyway. Breakfast was a depressing affair, a couple of odd pastries, hard boiled egg. I went to McDonalds on the way out. Dreadful, nearly £100, simply awful. Management tried to get the original of this review taken down claiming that the other rooms were a different hotel. Well, there was no indication of this, I booked Tophams, nothing changed, the bill came from Tophams, I was not asked and did not consent to staying somewhere else. Keep at it management if you want, I'll just keep reposting it. Maybe you should address the serious issues rather than try to silence your 'guests'. Oh, and 4 stars? The English Tourist Board have never heard of you! Hopefully they will investigate. 
-4;" I've not been taken advantage of by staying in the accommodation, I, unfortunately had the mis-pleasure of trying to eat here instead.  Everything seemed fine on arrival; the cracks started to appear though when we ordered cocktails to go with our rather lovely chacuterie starter.   Some time passed...  Having almost finished our starters when our cocktails deigned to put in an appearance, we thought it best to order the wine to go with the meal if it was going to stand any chance of coinciding with it.   How wrong we were!  Some more time passed...  After trying to catch the eye of any passing interested employee to find out how the fermenting of our grapes was coming along, I had revelation. A bar! I thought, they have a bar!   I sauntered along to said bar, and was able to obtain some drinks from the barman whom I regaled with our story of having to resort to visiting the bar as we were unable to get anyone's attention to ascertain the whereabouts' of our wine.  Some time later...  Admittedly, shortly before our desserts were served (about 5 minutes apart), a member of staff came over to apologise for forgetting our wine order. No more, no less.  I wish, in retrospect that I should have left this disaster without paying. This is, by a long way, the WORST SERVICE I have encountered in Reading in a long time. "
-4; This was oue first stay in a Hilton after moving from IHG brand hotels. Our booking confirmation stated we had a evening meal booked with an allowance back to the company. The hotel refused to honour this despite proof of booking form and contact from the booking agents. I was kept awake 2 hours by poeople arguing in the hallway and at 6am by staff banging around. The breakfast was uninspiring and not as much choice as IHG branded hotels. I am now in the process of refusing the decision to change to Hilton due to this experience for which I was not apologised to by the hotel or staff. 
-4; What can I say,,,, £12:50 for a 175 glass of white wine!!! Don't bother go across the road for a equally good glass of wine for a quarter of the price,,, I will never be going into this hotel for a drink there is no atmosphere and not many people who drink in the bar,,,, I know why now,,, I feel like I was robbed, I didn't think Dick Turpin came this far up country until this week,,, NEVER AGAIN 
-4;" Despite a guaranteed reservation the hotel had clearly given my room away when i arrived at 11pm.   I had to wait 20 minutes while a room was &quot;cleaned&quot;. Ended up in an attic room with no heating ( cold December night) and the main air conditioning plant next door.  It wasn't so much this as an issue but that the Duty Manager was so disingenuous aboput the whole experience "
-4; Its manager Carlos Dias is rude, unprofessional and inattentive. Rarely I met such a luck of professionalism and passion. When we checked-in they couldn't find our booking, so they simply invited us to step out and to send them the booking.com email confirmation. I felt like an undesirable guest. When I told the manager they should improve their customer service, this guy simply reply saying that he's not payed enough to greet rude customers like us!?!?!   If I was the general manager I would fire this guy straight away.  As a frequent flyers, we will definitely stay at Hilton next time. 
-4; It's not often you have a stand up row in reception but that's how it ended when they refused bar and restaurant service at 10:45 and only allowed a room service pizza which you are forbidden to eat any where else.   There is no service culture here. Avoid at all cost.   Having booked here for the last 5 years with a corporate group we will not book again.   The rest of the group suffered a poor restaurant meal so avoid this as well. 
-4; Whilst the Hotel was well kept I would suggest that you check in advance if there any night tome functions that may be happening in the Hotel and the proximity of your room. Having stayed there on Saturday 26th we found there was a wedding taking place. This is fair enough but what we were not expecting was the noise in the bedroom to sound as if we were in the middle of the dance floor. This lasted until 1.00 pm. In fairness we were told on arrival that there might be some noise but there was no alternative room available so I would suggest you check in advance unless you are planning a late night yourself.       . our room to be surectl dSeptember we were adv 
-4; Came for a football tournament. We stayed in the standard accommodation and we're thoroughly disappointed. It had an unpleasant smell which lingered the whole weekend. The kitchen area was beyond dated, and barely worked. The beds didn't even have proper mattresses, and the bathroom was falling to bits. Also, the couches were stained, and the TV didn't work! Luckily, with the football being the reason for being there, we didn't have to spend much time in the accommodation! 
-4; Smallest room I've ever stayed in at a so called 4 star hotel and a single bed being described as a DOUBLE what a con. I stayed at the Shaftesbury on a theatre trip with my wife on Saturday evening and was looking forward to a 4 star DELUXE DOUBLE room as described on the booking. What I got was the equivalent of a converted store cupboard with a bed no bigger than a single. The bed length took up the whole width of the room so to get to the other side of the room you had to crawl over it. We are not big people (12 stone and 7 stone) and we found it totally inadequate. The authorities should clamp down on this misleading claim of being a double room and enforce them to describe the room fully i.e. Warning for children or very small adults only. If you our thinking that an alternative bigger, normal room may be offered then think again as when we complained we were told that ALL their rooms are of this size. My advice would be to look elsewhere as this hotel is not cheap and you will be very disappointed with what you will find. 
-4;"After travelling from Liverpool, stopping in Romford and doing four hours work, I eventually got to The Gleneagles in Southend on Sea at around 6:30pm after setting out at 6am in the morning.  Upon arrival I was greeted by a phone with a message to buzz &quot;0&quot; for assistance. It took me nearly 15 minutes to get someone to answer who informed me they would be right down. Nearly 10 minutes later and I was greeted with a minion who asked me my name which I gave him....... He then asked would it be booked in another name...... I said &quot;NO&quot; and showed him the email booking conformation on my phone. he then made excuse's, non of which made any sense, and was left to my own devices again for about another 10 mins, at this point the B&B owner turned up to inform me that she had double booked me, as she never checked the fax or email that was sent her, and accepted a phone booking in its stead.  I was pointed in the direction of some other hotels and when i found one I explained what had happened to be informed that she does it all the time...........  As for the rest of the B&B etc. I can't comment as I never got passed the so called reception area (a small phone desk with a phone on it). But based on my short experiance of the place it was a blessing in disguise."
-4; Stayed in Silver apartment - disgusting to say the least. I don't live in dirt at home so I certainly don't expect to pay to stay in filthy conditions. Staff completely disinterested in issues. You only receive automated text messages to ask if sorted. If you respond NO - you are promised a phone call which never happens. I took a collection of photographs showing the filth. A lot of the facilities such as swimming pool was not in full operation and the queues went on and on and on. I spent most the holiday stood in a queue to pay for things that are not included at over the top prices. FAMILIES SHOULD AVOID AT ALL COST. It sounds too good to be true and believe me most of the things children really want to do cost more. Add to that the filthy dirty toilets and not a place to spend you hard earned cash on. The carpet in the Pavillion was absolutely FILTHY and smelt awful and covered in stains. 
-4; We are occasionally tempted to use this awful and vastly overpriced Hotel. The temptation is due to its convenience if we arrive very late or leave very early with our young daughter !!! But upon reflection a short walk to the Marriott would make us feel a lot better !!  The Hilton is old and most rooms require refurbishment , it's not cleaned to an acceptable standard, staff are rude and clearly not trained in customer care.  If you are forced to stay then avoid the inedible breakfast that cost for 3 over £60 and was left virtually untouched as it was cold and extremely poor quality !  To summarise if this Hotel was in other location it would not survive !! 
-4; Having stayed a few times at Sofitel Gatwick North I am now finding that they are fast becoming quite arrogant because people keep giving it reasonable reviews without thinking hard what they are saying. In October more than 30 days advance booking it gave a price of £109 and stated a discount would be given for booking so well in advance. I didn't receive this. I have a copy of that offered discount. On challenging them they stated the discount was in the price. Following that the worded discount disappeared from the advert. No further reply from Accor (Sofitel). I am just another statistic not seen to be a loyal customer. Won't be staying there again. Don't think you are anyone special with them. Have a look at the Premier Inn reviews - worth ttrying ? 
-4; We stayed here overnight for a race I was attending in Padstow and booked a family room for the night. Our initial impressions of the room and the pub were that is was ok. The room was cleanish and the staff were polite and helpful. We went to Padstow for dinner and returned to go to bed and were horrified that the pub basically resembled a nightclub. Very loud music dance music being pumped out by a DJ in the rear courtyard until 23:30 meant that we were unable to hear the tv in our room let alone sleep. We went to the bar at one point and asked one of the staff to send the manager up to our room so we could discuss the noise. Nobody ever bothered coming up. We go away a lot to different parts of the country and this is by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Please do not stay here. It is a noisy pubs with rooms not a hotel. 
-4; We're a family of four who booked two nights at the Molesweorth Arms a couple of weeks before going at the end of August. On arrival the hotel had no record of our booking. Three members of staff stared at the computer screen for several minutes, asking what our surname was, what our christian names were, even had we booked under another name? We explained that we definitely had booked in our own name (we're not spies) over the phone. The room and its facilities - including the view over the pedestrian precinct - had been described to us and our credit card details had been taken. My wife even recognised the voice of one of the members of staff who claimed to have no record of our booking. No room was available and it was eventually explained to us that had we asked for the name of the person who took our booking (foolishly we hadn't) they might have been able to help us - as if the mention of Tom, Harry or possibly Dick would have magically conjured up a vacant room. We left and found a room at the delightful Cross House Hotel in Padstow where, incidentally, the owner informed us he had welcomed other rejected Molesworth Arms' guests only a week before. So my advice, unless you like slightly grubby surroundings and diffident staff who seem more interested in their tattoos and hair extensions than they are in customer service, avoid the Moleworth Arms in Wadebridge. 
-4;Came together with a party of nearly 40 most off us stayed the evening started with us being occupied in the house great hall, it went down hill from then on too few staff who did not know what they were doing wine for the table which was expensive and poor in quality. the seating was so close together that my wife and many of our party had to stand up to let staff and people pass which on one table came to blows, food came after an hour which was not hot and insufficient to go around. Many went home or to bed early what a RIP OFF ,It made me ashamed to be considered a local.
-4; When we arrived we thought this was the most stunning hotel, we have stayed in the groups other hotel Lumpley Castle so knew it would be amazing.  Lovely theme room, welcoming staff and amazing gardens.  But then we went to dinner and despite being there when it opened 90mins wait for our food, no appology. The table next to us walked out. Food was very nice but 90mins is too long.  Upon returning to our room greeted by loud thudding music, as our comments mentioned this venue has weddings. At 11pm rang to ask when would the thudding end as we could not sleep, 1am!!! Then said when we rang to book should have been explained, but we booked online!   Be warned the porter told everyone there are weddings every weekend and outside music till 1am. It was hellish. We really considered checking out at 11am and going somewhere else the noise was so bad.   
-4; Arrived, late evening after booking this hotel online through the hotels own website to be told that their computer system allows them to over book rooms by 2.  Long and short of it all rooms gone and no room for me!!! Not what you want to hear after a 4 hour drive.  When booking the website said only 4 rooms left so I can only assume that the rooms were given out on a first come first served basis.  Having a booking number and confirmation meant nothing.  Im sure the hotel is nice but cant say that as I did not get a room. The only redeeming feature was the help I got finding a room from the lovely Samantha. It must have been hard dealing with a tired and grumpy traveller. However I was promised points on my priority card by way of compensation but this did not happen.  So be warned, book here and you may be left high and dry.   My advise go elsewhere... 
-4; Room 5052 junior suite is situated nxt to the lift so you will be kept up all night with the sound of the lift shaft and its mechanism. The state of the room was very poor for a junior suite as well. Not impressed at all as this was supposed to be a romantic break and concert which was ruined. 
-4; Without doubt, this is a hotel that does not live up to its reputation. My wife and I stop over in Chester once a month and usually book into the abode. I thought we would have a change but regret doing so. Our room was not ready on our arrival. We were offered a complimentary drink at the bar but after 25 minutes had to go back to reception to check if the room was now ready. Once entering the room I was quite shocked. I did not expect to see wall paper peeling away from the wall, as it was in a number of places. The bathroom cleanliness left a lot to be desired. No safe for personal belongings and a TV for which the remote only worked if you gave it a tap! All in all a very poor hotel indeed, The Abode seems to have set a standard that the Plaza can only dream of. 
-4;" We are in our 50's and have had the pleasure of staying in many hotels over a 30 year period, including Hilton in London. When my wife told me she had booked the Hilton in York as a special treat after a couple of very difficult years for me I really looked forward to the stay. The hotel was booked through Late rooms - but clearly the cause for this complaint is not their fault, What a disappointment!! the room was defined as a &quot;King&quot; Hilton guestroom (the King bit referring to the bed size) and as having traditional décor with a desk. The rooms of this type look quite large on their website, rest assured this is cute photography, as the room was very small and badly lit, but, we thought we were only sleeping in the room so what the heck' The real problem came when we got into the bed, sure enough it is large, it is also awfully uncomfortable, the mattress is either very dated or very cheap (or both?) as the corners appeared to be higher than the middle suggesting at least one or the other, the base of the bed was also an MDF or Hardboard panel so no springs to soften the supporting panel or awful mattress. I woke up at 3pm with a sore back and didn't get to sleep again, which ruined the Sunday morning early walk around this lovely city and my wife got hardly any sleep at all. The room was also cold, as the heating didn't come on until 7.00 in the morning so couldn't sit out to watch the TV (whilst I couldn't sleep).   The TV had an awfully grainy picture, but I know this isn't something that can just be fixed easily so didn't bother reporting it, and the bathroom extractor vent was so dirty I'm not surprised no-one will obviously go near it to clean it - on the room side this is.   One of the headboard lights had obviously been replaced and was not designed to be fixed to a shaped headboard as the opposite light was, as a result it was out of alignment and an entirely different finish to the opposite light - a small detail maybe - but we are talking Hilton here!!  This room is not worth anything near the £159.00 per night that we paid, In total we paid £193 for the 'break' and consider it a waste of money, we will never be going back and urge you not too go, oh? and the 'Traditional decor' for this read old and in need of a refurb!, some of the paint was yellow and the room was nothing like the photo's (Room 350 for info!) We didn't get to complain as we checked out as the desk was ridiculously busy, and they just took the room card off us, smiled and said goodbye! They know something! The only shining light was the valet parking guy that parks you car for you, great character and a lovely sense of humour, maybe they should take him out of valet parking and put him above ground!!   We are not used to complaining, and don't like raising a complaint, but there are limits. "
-4; Just terrible. Period.  Minimal staff that don't seem to understand basic requests.  What more can I say 
-4; My wife went for a spa experience day including afternoon tea. The Spa Reception staff were unhelpful, and one had his feet on the desk as he spoke to us. The instructions he gave were vague and mumbled, and we felt he was in a rush to get rid of us, although the room was empty and he had nothing to do. We eventually found the spa and changing rooms, despite there being no direction signs.The spa itself had a total of 2 people in, very poor for a Bank Holiday Monday. We soon realised why. The facilities were very basic, to put it politely. A pool, sauna, an aroma sauna (which had no heat), an ice room (?) and infrared sauna (out of use) and a steam room (overheated therefore impossible to even enter) a shower and that was it. There were no staff to advise on which order to use anything, or the benefits of the facilities. Nor were there any information signs. Thankfully the massage was a happier experience. Rachel was very friendly and a good masseuse. The afternoon was also very nice, lovely staff, and refreshment. The main downside to the Spa Experience, was just the actual Spa experience!! We certainly won't be coming again. 
-4; My wife and I stayed at this hotel last Saturday night (13/9/14). I had to leave very early in the morning for a business trip to the USA, and my wife got up later to go down to breakfast, She was completely ignored by the staff, and didn't even get a cup of coffee. She was too embarrassed to ask for service and left the breakfast room. This hotel is an ABSOLUTE DISGRACE. The mysogonistic staff should be severaly reprimanded and retrained. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone. 
-4; Won't recommend this hotel, but i need to stay here as it is our company's preferred hotel & is close by our UK office. Rooms below par - old, lumpy beds, faulty aircon, flaky TV system etc, etc......... food OK - but overpriced. 
-4; Not much choice @ breakfast sittings.. Expensive in the bar& lack of organisation more staff needed .. Breakfast items weren't coming out regularly @ the same time to warrant a full breakfast plate .. 
-4; Booked a two night stay here in July. My girlfriend was in London already so arrived at the hotel in the afternoon to be told there were maintenance issues and that 95% of guests were being moved. When she enquired where, they said a sister 4 star hotel in Kensington and that they would arrange a complimentary taxi. While waiting for the taxi, two girls were checked in to a room there. She had to chase the taxi with reception and 15 minutes later arrived at the 3 star kensington townhouse hotel, near Earl's Court station. They offered us a complimentary breakfast at the hotel over the road, however this was not something we were fussy about as we had booked room only. She was shown to a room on the ground floor which was so small, there was not enough room to even put her bag on the floor, never mind when I was due to arrive in the evening with another bag - the room was literally a double bed and a cupboard for a bathroom. She complained to the manager and was moved to a bigger room on the top floor. The hotel itself was ok ish, however not what or where we'd booked. My girlfriend sent an email to the customer service team, due to the inconvenience she had experienced and also as the rates on their website showed a big difference between the nightly rates at the hotel we'd booked and where we actually ended up. We neither received a reply or any offer of compensation. Avoid. 
-4; Arrived early evening on Friday and were informed we could reserve a table at the restaurant. We then discovered there were no tables for almost 3 hours almost closing time for the restaurant. Would have been nice to have been informed this prior to arrival after a long drive.   In the room, we discovered the bed sheets were not tucked in fully, a duvet cover was ripped and the other cover was only 3/4 of the way on the duvet. a lovely bare footprint on the suede of the seat in the room, a half full shampoo container in the complimentary toiletries.  We had decided to order room service as the restaurant was so busy and after 7 attempts several of which the receiver appeared to be lifted and hung up again i finally managed to order. 30 minutes later some warmish food arrived. It was however the wrong sort of burger on the rolls. Another few attempts to phone eventually got through and was informed they would make a correct order and would be 20 minutes or so. I told them it was OK we would eat what we had but weren't happy.  On to breakfast the next day. The coffee cups were filthy and trying to find a clean one to replace them was not an easy task. My partner then found a hair in her beans, and to top it off one cooked into her fried egg yolk.   The receptionist was very helpful when confronted with our list of complaints and very professional in handling it and did discount the food due to the trouble, so well done to her. I was informed the hotel general manager would be informed and would e-mail me about it promptly... Still waiting. 
-4;" Just spent a weekend here, they don't really want the inconvenience of overnight guests and would much prefer corporate or group bookings.  Firstly the breakfast on the Saturday was moved to accommodate a function booked into the room usually used for breakfast with access to the hot buffet facilities, this meant trays of cold food left in a little annex off the main corridor as the mini heaters left under the trays didn't work. When we requested poached eggs we were advised that the kitchen was &quot;too busy&quot;, not something that I have experience at a hotel before.   The room was pretty grim with loads of hairs on the carpet and the shower having a broken water adjustment button.   At the bar despite the menu showing wine by the bottle it was only available to order by the glass as apparently there was no &quot;by the bottle stock&quot; and if you want a brandy it comes served in the same glasses they use for toothbrushes in the bathroom as brandy glasses as they are &quot;too delicate for the dishwasher&quot;.   This &quot;hotel&quot; even has a Christmas tree with flashing lights at the entrance to advertise for Christmas party bookings, just what every warm summer day needs!!!!  Avoid this place. "
-4; Oh my god I have seen it all. Why did I not check out this site before ? It could have saved me from a nightmare. This Tara place has to be the grubbiest hotel I have ever had the misfortune to spend a night.  My wife and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Copthorne Tara Hotel to celebrate my birthday in London. On arrival we asked for a complimentary upgrade in view of the occasion and they obliged our request giving us what they later described as an executive double room on the 11th floor. We found the room okay at first glance with all the standard trimmings although we had to request a second bath robe. Also the fridge was quite loud and lacked a retaining bar for storing bottles upright inside the door which meant a problem with a wine bottle we had bought to celebrate.As it was extremely warm in the hotel we found it necessary to switch on the air-conditioning straight away to cool the room. When we later retired we found on turning down the air conditioning fan that it was making annoying intermittent grinding sounds which kept us awake. The sound was eventually so unbearable that at around 12 midnight we called reception to ask what could be done - indeed could we be moved to another room which was also away from the London underground train line outside which we found we could hear loudly with the air conditioning turned down. The attitude of the reception staff and later the night manager to this request was quite appalling and in a terse manner we were informed that no rooms were available not even a downgraded one and that we should check with reception in the morning. They never even offered to put in a request for us to the morning staff. Their attitude throughout was rather to scold us for complaining - and as we'd been upgraded why should we complain at all despite the fact the heating/fan system was malfunctioning? Then to top it off at 3:32AM the hotel alarm went off which was located across from our room and when we phoned to find out if we should evacuate we were informed it was a false alarm.At 4:30AM we reluctantly agreed to let them send up an engineer to fix the problem which we told would be carried out. The engineer arrived and said the only thing that he could do was shut down the damper motor which controlled the cooling unit. This, he admitted in a joking manner, was a common re-occurring problem throughout the hotel and proceeded to tell us of former guests who believed the loud sound to be that of someone tapping on their window endlessly. Turning this off only shut down the cooling unit. By this time the room had cooled a little and we attempted to get some sleep without air conditioning but it was just too warm and the morning arrived with us having not gotten any sleep. Because of the malfunctioning of the heating/fan system, my wife started feeling ill and came down with a cold because of the abrupt changes in temperature when she was healthy with no cold symptoms when we arrived. We were, by this point, extremely angry - after all it was the morning of my birthday - and we only had another two days!! At around 8am my wife phoned reception to again ask to be moved rooms given that the necessary air conditioning was not working and after yet another defensive response / tug of war from the reception staff they finally agreed to move us immediately to another equivalent room on the 11th floor at the back of the hotel. Amazing how this had suddenly become available. On arrival there we again found only one bath robe but that the facilities were better, tall glasses and hot chocolate along with the tea/coffee maker and a quieter fridge which now had a retaining bar to store a wine bottle upright! Lacking sleep we retired and had to forego our sightseeing plans for the day which ate up half of the morning and my wife was under the weather.We did manage to only visit one place of interest late afternoon, the British Museum of Natural History, but were alarmed when we returned to our hotel room. Upon our return we then found that our room was left in disarray and had not been made up despite us putting the 'please make up the room' sign hanging outside when we left around 11am. We phoned reception and were told again in a very abrupt rather terse manner that this room had not been listed for servicing but would send someone up to clean up our room and pointed out that we had been given another upgraded executive room so we should be thankful. When the chambermaid arrived, she told us she was only instructed to bring up clean towels and not tidy our bed nor anything else in the room. No one had told us this and as we were at our wits end by this point we demanded to see the hotel manager immediately. We demanded to be moved to another room or the immediate servicing of our room (in view of time we had to forgo freshening up and changing for the West End show we had booked that night. The manager's attitude echoed the staff in being very defensive and explained that our room was not scheduled to be cleaned on that day even though they were fully aware we checked in that morning and left the service room sign on the outside of our hotel door.My wife was in tears in disbelief of such shabby service and attitude. Seeing how distraught we had become from this awful experience, he agreed to have our existing room serviced immediately for us and offered us complimentary bottle of wine for the trouble caused and extended a handshake which we refused to acknowledge as we told him until we see efforts made to service our room.For a 4* hotel the attitude of the hotel staff overall was unprofessional, unsympathetic and appalling and the manager's defensive approach to our complaints of lack of service, comfort and rest during our stay and the terse attitude of the reception staff made us very unwelcome at this hotel and we will not stay here again.The attitude throughout by hotel staff was 'well why should you complain - we've upgraded you!!' If you do stay here don't ask for an upgrade and then complain over any lack of comfort because you'll be made to feel bad for doing it which is a reflection of them unprofessionally and ill regard for assuring comfort toward their hotel guests. They are not a 4* hotel and not worthy of a 1*. Avoid and make your stay at a true 4* hotel who cares about quality and hotel guests' comfort. We would not want you to go through this nightmarish experience. To top it off I returned home covered in insect bites this could have only been from the beds in the Copthorne Tara, this is the first time in 25 years I have needed to remove my clothing in the porch after a stay in a hotel and place it in to a bin bag before entering my home and walking straight up to the bathroom to take a bath. What a joke... 
-4; I arrived at the Hilton at 3pm on the 10th July looking forward to relaxing before a special event that evening I was greeted by pandemonium, a long queue at the check in, people spending at least 5 mins when they got to reception. Hilton managed to turn a crisis into a disaster, By being assertive I managed by to get into a my room at 5.30 for some people it was much later that evening. You expect brands like Hilton to have managers who can cope with system failures and put in back up procedures, utter shambles. 
-4; Stayed here on Friday evening in the hope of a relaxing time, but my night was hell. Unfortunately the Village had booked a party and was woken by a crowd of partygoers who seemed to crowd into an adjacent bedroom screaming and laughing at 12:45 am! Complained to the night manager who sent somebody up to quieten the hysteria but did not make much difference. Sadly, my plight was not helped by the pulsating beat of the downstairs disco at 1am. Bleary eyed checking out I mentioned it to the receptionist who just simply smiled. I overhead an adjacent guest also checking out complaining in a similar fashion. Sadly, I will never stay in this hotel again after my experience. 
-4;Firstly I did not stay at the hotel and I am rating the pub/restaurant the hotel may be very good. I visited the feathers on my way back from Whitby to call in for some food / drink. I lasted all of 5 minutes as we where made to feel extremely unwelcome by the surly staff. We where qualified quickly and badly by the dark haired gentleman when we got there , he had the charisma of a house brick and swiftly directed us away from the comfortable looking lounge into a dingy and deathly quite side room with nobody in it as we wanted to eat . Others where eating and there was plenty of room and seemingly nobody waiting but there you go . On trying to find this room I politely asked another male member of staff where the ' coffee room' was . He said ' there LOOK mate' and pointed to the said ' coffee room' sign above the door . I don like being called mate or treated like an idiot , I left and shall not be returning . I must be part of a chain as that classless level of service and hospitality is fairly rare among the privateers . It is only the chains where such poor staff can exist. Poor very poor.
-4; After a five hour drive, we were looking forward to a beer and some food. Despite the website stating that the restaurant was open until 10pm, we were told at 9:15 it had closed 5min ago. When we asked about ordering food at the bar (advertised as offering for 24/7), we were told we should order room service as there was a wedding there (we weren't told of this in advance). When we rang for room service, no one answered!!! 
-4;" Stayed here 1 night last week for my birthday along with my partner.   Check-in was swift and although we were early we were able to go straight to a room which was nice. We were on the 5th floor.   When we got in the room we were very disappointed to find watermarks and stains on the side boards and glass coverings. The fridge would not open. The compartment next to the television had a broken hinge so we couldn't shut it and had to be left open for the entire stay.   The room's air-conditioning was not working and was uncomfortably hot.   After using the loo I pressed the flusher and it broke off and fell backwards into the cistern! Did not expect any of this for a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel brand. We promptly reported it to housekeeping who came and replaced it. The maintenance man commented on how it is &quot;an awful design&quot;. After getting this sorted I went for a shave in the lovely basin. Unfortunately, this too did not go to plan as the plug would not push back up when pushing on the plunger. This was in the evening and again we rang the front desk to report it. Due to the time there was no maintenance team available but they would send a maid up to try and fix it. Alas, she was not able to so we were stuck all our trip with a basin full of hairy water!! The maid said she would report it and maintenance would be up the following morning to fix it along with the air conditioning.   I would recommend a visit to Cloud 23 as the views really are stunning. I would like to say a massive thank you to one of the front desk ladies who kindly printed off our train tickets and brought them up to us - it was a lovely gesture, thank you.  We ordered 2x breakfasts in our room which were fine - nothing special but worth the money. We rang the front desk at around 10am asking about our sink and air conditioning - the rude operator said it had not been reported and would send someone up immediately. When we went to check out at 11:30am the issue had still not been rectified.   I wrote to Hilton directly using their online recent stay feedback form (this was 1 week ago) and I still have not heard back. They state I should hear back within 72 hours. This I find totally out of order and not what I had expected. I am completely disappointed and afraid to say will not be staying at another Hilton if this is the way they treat their guests. "
-4; Overall a good hotel but i was severley let down by them charging me £40 pounds for a 3 course meal for 2 that we never ate, me and my partner were late back from an outing and unfortunately missed the restaurant opening times so we were unable to eat our booked meal, the hotel refused to budge on this issue and insisted on charging us the full amount for something that we never had, such a shame................... Also was unable to sit in the lobby during the daytime as all seating was reserved for a wedding party, nice of them to let you know this............... Sleep was disturbed due to arguing guests right outside at 3am........... 
-4; I visited this hotel with a group of friends for a night out in Chester, with a view to it being a potential meeting place for frequent business visits as I have recently expanded my business to the Chester area from London. On arrival, I found the hotel to be in the perfect location and with ample facilities. However, once it dawned upon the reception staff that a group of mid-twenty year old adults had checked in, it seemed we had been stereotyped immediately. We felt we were victimised on several occassions, the most notably on the saturday evening when a security guard, receptionist and bar attendant made us feel very un-welcome in the hotel bar even though we were the only party in the entire bar itself, resulting in us leaving after one drink. In addition the hotel were unable to fulfil their promotional offer of free tickets to the 'Cruise' bar & lounge across the road, this seemed to be the catalyst to change the opinions of the staff's views towards the group. Unless the hotel reviews its staff members and service I will not be visiting this hotel again and would much rather pay for the travelodge directly next door, just as 3 of the party did for the final evening on their own accord. 
-4; Please Avoid This Hotel as I feel it was Falsely advertised? - Room 103 looked wonderful When I looked both the hotels Webb site and the company we booked through and I wanted to treat my wife as a delayed wedding anniversary the ideal place or so it seamed?   What a mistake the hotel is split into several buildings the room we chose was in what looked like a converted Life Boat Station, the sky light would not close properly due to rust the view from the rooms balcony was not as advertised I called the hotel several times to find out which room was shown in the picture as I wanted that view the woman was very helpful and said 103 it is priced at £205 per night and although expensive I wanted the 6 nights to be special! - we stayed one night and even though I had not booked another hotel I thought I would rather stay in a premier inn than here so we left!  I read a review on trip adviser once we arrived as I could not believe the room and found a couple stayed in the same room the week before and noticed YELLOW Staines on the mattress topper and reported this to the management? I checked and they were still there but as I had been drinking we had to stay that night, so although Richard was very sorry they could not be bothered to clean the bedding between stays disgusting!  No WIFI in the rooms, no mobile phone signal in the village, you do get free calls from the room but would they be private?  The holiday company we used called the hotel and spoke to Richard who I think was the manager, and explained we were leaving that day and when I handed in the key he had the cheek to other my wife and I a two night stay free of charge but bearing in mind we had driven over 160 miles we would not stay even if we were 10 miles away! 
-4; What a joke! The one room out of a booking for 11 rooms that was meant to be a twin was set as a double, ending as a double and camp bed! Another rooms fan was broken so they attempted to replace with one with EXPOSED LIVE TERMINALS. Windows screwed shut on a hot day. Avoid this hotel!!! 
-4;" I phoned to book a stay about 3 weeks before, Alex the owner answered and sounded quite abrupt on phone, which very nearly deterred me from booking, however thought I'd give him benefit of doubt, and made booking, ( but had gut feeling something was'nt quite right. ) Arrived at Hotel, Alex answered door, I introduced myself and family, just about to reach out to shake his hand, but in a flash he turned to get keys for rooms, and tells us quickly, you're all on top floor one room here one room there, sort yourself out Guys..... I'm watching the cricket, He then asked us to fill out a card to give an idea of breakfast for next day and leave it on table in hall, and if going out, keys were to be left in draw of table in hallway, very odd, but that's their policy! So first morning of breakfast arrived, we had circled 8.45 am on card, along with food requests, as we arrived at bottom of stairs, at 8.46 am, Alex was waiting in hallway with a face like thunder, and said &quot;AT LAST&quot; in a very stern tone, we tried to state that we were 1 minute later than 8 .45, he did'nt want to know and just rushed us into dining room with a comment of CHAPS CHAPS, sort yourselves out, TEAS HERE COFFEES HERE, everyone's going to come down the same time now and off he rushed not a happy chappy, very surreal and unsettling experience, Fortunately we were then served our meals by Alex's son who was a really lovely polite young man, who we asked about our 1 minute late arrival for breakfast, and he told us it was no problem it was only a guide time for them, and not to worry even if we were 5 minutes late, it was'nt a problem, ( pity Alex was'nt of the same mindset ). At the end of breakfast we asked if we could change the time and food selection for following day, and the son told us he would get a new card to fill in, then as we are leaving dining room, we could hear Alex asking his son, what's that for give it here, and came rushing out of kitchen asking us what's the problem, we explained we'd like to change the breakfast request for the following day, he said unhappily you can let us know later!   that evening we rang the bell on hall table, a woman appeared with no hello or introduction, + informed us to change original card and leave on table, (it was Alex's wife ) next 2 days Alex was all GUYS + SQUIRE, and O.T.T. much like Basil Fawlty. All to little to late, all our years of holidays, never experienced anything like this, and we could'nt wait to leave, very dissapointed!! "
-4; Just had a weekend stay at Lakeside - never again. If you want good quality food don't come here. If you want well maintained accommodation and your problems solved don't come here. If you want helpful staff don't come here. Don't bother completing the questionnaire because the management don't respond to them when things go wrong.  Overall wont be going back. 
-4; We decided to book a midweek break with warners holiday after seeing the TV advertisement and chose the lakeside coastal village at Hayling Island and after checking their web site, which showed that they had an extensive Gluton free menu as my wife has celiac'a and activities to do like Zumba, tennis and others. This proved to be a poor decision the whole site is in need of a update and the starling accommodation needs to be refurnished epically the bathrooms, with broken tiles, loose toilet seats, broken bath panels and dirty grouting. We went to book some activities and was told tennis was not longer available, no tennis courts. Zumba was also not available as the instructor left last year, archery was booked, well we arrived for the session to find that there was twelve guest waiting also and with only two bows and two targets it was going to take ages to trial this activity as it was for only one hour. On the first night we went to the restaurant for our evening meal at 19:00 as pre arranged, my wife had pre booked her meal in the morning of our arrival our relations who were with us decided to try to carvery and came back with nearly empty plates, as the vegetable selection was reduced to anaemic parsnips and a few carrots, the second night my wife was looking forward to seeing the extensive Gluton free menu only to be shown the same menu as the day before with the same choice, salmon, gammon steak or omelette, when we asked to see the restaurant manager, he came to our table and we showed him the Gluton free menu on their web site and asked why we have not been shown this one, his reply was that was last years menu, so warners web site is so far out of date it's scary. There was two positive parts of the holiday, one was our waitress Andrea who worked hard and did her best to ensure that our stay was good and the other was the sites entertainment team who worked hard to ensure that the evenings shows were good and very enjoyable. Would I stay there again no, no, no.  
-4; The hotel and rooms are great, however, there seems to be penny pinching and poor service at every possible stage of the stay. For example, having paid for the room and breakfast in advance, I was told that I would be charged £50 per night on my debit card - in case I used the facilities and it would be refunded if I didn't use them. This really made me wary of what may come and it was a good warning.  The restaurant had hilariously poor service, the worst I have ever encountered. To start with, we ordered some starters, when we tracked down a member of staff. We then waited... and waited.. and eventually one starter arrived. Sadly, not the one either of us ordered. So the waiting commenced. We received out starter after waiting over one hour. We were quite lucky though as someone on an adjacent table gave up after about 2 hours having only received a starter. The staff were so illusive, they had to be hunted down at every stage. At some stages there was a pack of diners circling the restaurant for a member of waiting staff. The food and wine is also too expensive, an ordinary bottle of wine that cost £7 is Waitrose is over £30. The cheapest item on the menu (sausage and mash) is about £15. All with a 12.5% gratuity added as standard.  The breakfast was similar penny pinching, £20 for a buffet service, with surcharges for kippers/fish. There was also no option to have the eggs cooked to your liking - fried. Take it or leave it.   The sad thing is that the hotel has great potential. It I s however ruined by the local management and service. 
-4; My partner and I booked to stay for one night as a getaway for a birthday celebration. We stayed in the Annex building room 233. The room was extremely dull and dated with stained grey carpet and mis-matched furniture straight out of the 1970s. The bed was a small double and not comfortable and the television had barely 3 channels that weren't fuzzy and one of those was Sky news. We were near the function suite and so endured a LONG night of thumping music and drunk revellers from an office Christmas party wandering up and down the hotel corridors and outside our window shouting and arguing. Facilities in the room were bog standard and the plug socket in the wardrobe was hanging out of the wall. They have some audacity charging the price they do, this is by no means a 4 star hotel more like a poor quality travel lodge from 15 years ago. We will never be returning and would actively discourage others from parting with their hard earned money, you WILL be disappointed. 
-4;" Room is a strange layout. After using the toilet you have to walk to the shower room to wash your hands. My room was on top of a train/DLR stop. Better glazing would be required for a good night's sleep. Carpet was disgustingly dirty and the room smelt, I complained and they said 'they would inform maintenance'. Bed was very uncomfortable. It wasn't a type of mattress I have ever slept on before, felt like the foam out of a motorbike seat.  An example of the service is, I ordered room service; Steak and a bottle of beer, they didn't open the beer.  My stay included breakfast. 2 mornings tea was offered, 3 mornings it wasn't. "
-4;" I cannot believe this is a 4 star hotel I have been here since 11th November and am appalled at the state of the place.. It is in desperate need of a lick of paint, the ceiling in the dining room is smoke yellow and there are clean patches around the loft access. The first week we had a carvery every night because it was &quot;easier on the kitchen when they were busy&quot;. The loo roll holder was hanging off the wall, The trouser press along with the mini fridge had been removed, The lighting in the room was too dull to do any work by, My associate could not get a shower cap and she had to change rooms 4 times because of a lack of hot water, flooding through the ceiling and the 3rd room being filthy and nothing worked.  The most annoying thing was having to walk along a corridor that stank of cigarette smoke cause Dreams bedrooms were having their annual convention here and some people were smoking in the entrances, management should ensure they do not do this.  If I was paying myself I would refuse to pay "
-4; We are very local so came today for Sunday lunch. Service was abysmal waitress did not know difference between bitter and larger or what they served, food was substandard burnt yourkshires and dry chicken. We asked twice for condiments which were ignored. We complained which was taken with a pinch of salt and no real empathy. The only recommendation that I can make is to avoid at all cost 
-4;Turn on the bedside light and every light in the room goes on. Spent an hour trying to get it to work properly and eventually concluded that it is actually supposed to work that way. I've never seen anything so utterly ridiculous in any of the dozens of hotels I've stayed in, Also at that sort of price I don't expect to have to pay extra for wi-fi.
-4; Eleven of us treated ourselves to an afternoon tea and we were all very disappointed. I personally have been to several venues for afternoon teas and on other visits your are served your own sandwiches and a selection of cakes on your own tiered server. Your own pot of tea. Here the sandwiches came out on two plates the selection led a lot to be desired and the cakes well these were average. When we asked for extra tea this seemed to be an effort. The afternoon tea certainly wasn't worth the £153.00 that we paid. 
-4; I took my girlfriend away here for a nights stay via a groupon deal, been honest it wasn't worth the money at half price, I would expect this level of service and standards form a Blackpool £20 a night B&B. The food was very good to be fair but the staff were so under trained it was embarrassing, while at evening meal the complaints were flying from every table and everybody looking angry, frustrated and almost laughing in disbelief. Gordon Ramsay would of had a heart attack this night with half the people at tables finishing their food whilst the rest sat and watched, and other getting their meet put down to go cold whilst waiting over 20 mins for accompanying veg. The manager of the restaurant was clueless and lost and needs to learn how to run his area, there was a bunch of drunk golfers in dining, incredibly drunk and all you could hear throughout the meal, the staff should of politely asked them to be quiet at least. After the meal they continued in the bar, other than losing my temper with them we had no alternative to return to our room and watch TV ! Great !  There is no phone signal here if your on orange, and i could not connect to it via our orange business account, however they will let you connect for a stupid hourly fee, seriously, who in this day and age charges for WiFi ? I'm surprised there was not a meter in the car park.  The bars drink rates are silly, i know a company needs to make a profit, i expect to pay more then the supermarket when it is served to me, but charging me £31 for a £5 bottle of red wine is taking the absolute p*ss.  Afternoon tea unlike decent hotels is a crappy little dry scone and cup of warm coffee served in a dirty cup, and i don't mean it was split on the way over, it was dry and baked on round the sides.  The treatments were OK to say the most, i had a massage off a girl who i assume was hungover and couldn't be bothered. not professional at all, maybe she was on work experience.  The spa is quite good but could do with a clean and maintenance.  overall very disappointing and would not recommend this to anyone seeking a relaxing break. 
-4; This was our second stay at the Cedar court hotel,after our first stay we was in no doubt to return again this year,very enjoyable stay last year, this year however as ruined my view, the room was to be fair mostly clean but very small, the tv didnt work which took them two hours to come to the conclusion to move us but in the meantime shower time was also a disaster because there was an high volume of guests showering at the same time we had no hot water!!! We then took up the offer of a change of room to a twin, freezing cool no hot water and spacious it was, then come to try and get served 25 minutes later success a drink,then the meal in the Hollywood themed room,far from it to be honest freezing cool and to many tables crammed in that the staff were struggling to get round the tables,then the food was cold,warm at best, the quality was that of a meal you'd get in a truckers cafe,when we told the waiter his reply was nothing to do with me im not bothered, i know of two occasions were the waiter spilled the food on guests,then the bar lady informed me to fetch the emptys back with me,the entertainment was very poor,the entire visit was something you'd expect a two star not a four!!! The only reason i'd stay here again would be if i was working in the area, as the breakfast was lovely, at best i'd give our stay a 4 out of 10, Disappointing. 
-4; My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a wedding at which we had a great time. The venue looks impressive as you arrive, however the bedroom which cost £160 a night was shocking. The sink was cracked, the toilet seat stained, the shower was an over the bath type and the bath itself mouldy. Please see photos. When we complained we were initially offered a free upgrade for our next visit however as this was a one off visit we declined and asked for only a partial refund - they said no. Please avoid this place until it is renovated to a satisfactory standard. 
-4; Where do you start with such a poor hotel! This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel but everything about it was 1 star at best. Don't get me wrong, the rooms aren't that expensive but everything in the hotel looks like it's should have been improved at least 10 years ago. We arrived at 3 to be told the room that should have been ready at 2 was still not available. Waited another half an hour until room available. No apology from staff. Then we were informed that the lifts were not working. Eventually got to the suite on 3rd floor to find a hideous smell lingering in the whole room. Waited for manager to arrive for another half an hour....we had to suggest that they try to find us another room rather than be offered one immediately. We were then told that we had been upgraded to a 5th floor room....checked again and we were told the truth that it was actually a downgrade. This room was OK but still very dated. Basically, if you want an old and dated, fairly shabby understaffed hotel in the middle of Birmingham then this is the place for you. If you want a nice stay in the middle of Birmingham then I would suggest any of the hotels within 5 minutes walk ahead of this place. So many new Hotels nearby that make The Burlington irrelevant. It's location is great by the station but the hotel is so in need of a total refurb. Macdonald Hotel group should be ashamed to be associated with this hotel.....close it now of just admit that it's a 2 or 3 star place at best and charge £60 a night and then you'd accept it for what it is. 
-4; Lets start by saying I'm a priority club customer...when I booked this hotel I had confirmed a Queen Bedroom with breakfast. There is no normal Queen bedrooms in this hotel as I found out when I got there,,,only execs - so that was a good start!!...the blame culture immediately kicked in by the reception pointing the finger at central reservations. This was followed by them trying to charge me for breakfast again on checkout....after 10 mins they eventually gave in after I had to show them my booking....yet again the blame culture kicked in pointing the finger at central reservations rather than addressing the issue. All in all a rubbish stay with badly trained staff, not enough reception staff on checkout, even though 2 managers were stood behind reception chatting whist one worked.  It will never be visited again. 
-4; This is one place i shall never go back to,told to be there for 6-30 for pre drinks sat down at the table at 7-15 and told dinner would be served at 7-30,no chance,cold soup arrived about 8-30 and had to be sent back,when it did come back it was so hot you could not eat it,and when we said to the waiter it was to hot he said well you wanted it hot.The roast beef turned up at about 9-30 and this was cold and was sent back when it came back it was as tough as old boots,the dessert came about an hour later,when we asked what the problem was they said it was with the kitchen.when you run a hotel such as this and know the numbers that are coming and everybody has the same meal i cannot see how you can get it wrong.The one saving grace of the evening was that Jason Lee and the Group were absolutely brilliant had it Not been for Jason i dread to think what the night might have been. 
-4; 3 lifts, not enough. Spent more time queueing for lifts than in the hotel room!  Wifi didn't work for a single day I was there.  Had to go to reception twice to re-calibrate my key card. An hour of my life wasted.  Towels smelled of fried food.  No thanks. 
-4;" we stayed in this hotel last year with my family and we LOVED IT, we decided to book it again this year and wanted to book 4 rooms BUT THEY DECIDED, THEY NO LONGER WANTED YOUNG CHILDREN IN THEIR HOTEL ,they only want adults in there hotel rooms , we wanted to book a room with 2 adults and 1 child [ 6 months old] but they said they would not take our booking as the hotels policy was NO CHILD could stay in their parents room but the child could book his/hers own room [ 6 month old baby ????? as if this is going to happen] SO HOW MUCH money can this hotel afford to lose with this policy , i dont understand !!! PLEASE CAN SOME ONE FROM THIS HOTEL EXPLAIN THIS NEW &quot; NO CHILD POLICY&quot; and could you please put information on this policy on your website .Yes, we would have liked to have come back to this hotel but alas, no more due to there no children policy but we have managed to find 100s and i mean 100s of london hotels, who have welcomed me and my family to there hotels so sadly, we will not be going back to this hotel "
-4; We were married on May 7th at Coombe Abbey but fortunately held our evening reception elsewhere. Although we did not know it at the time a particular member of staff was extremely rude to one of our guests. Our main wedding organiser paid little attention to detail which meant our family having to make last minute checks and changes to the reception room. Our complaint was poorly handled. Good luck to anyone else who gets married there...looks can be deceiving. 
-4; My business partner and I were in Derby overnight and my pa booked us in the CQH online. We arrived around 7 in the evening to be told only one room had been booked not 2. Insisting there must have been a mistake, the belligerent child on the desk informed me it was our mistake and only one room was booked. As I was calling my pa to get the booking reference the belligerent child changed his story and informed me there were 2 rooms but the second room had already checked in - my partner was stood next to me!!!!!! Explaining that this couldn't be the case as we were both stood there he changed tack again blaming an administration error. The whole episode was conducted in a manner reminiscent of 'Kevin the teenager' and was thoroughly unprofessional and rude. The rooms themselves are already tired and badly kept. The wet room attempt in the bathroom is more like a 70's public baths than boutique hotel and the smell is from the same era. To top it off the wifi didn't work and yet another staff member who had attended the same charm school informed me there was nothing that could be done and was it really that important. An altogether appalling customer experience in a hotel isn't even close to boutique 
-4; This is without a doubt one of the worst Hilton hotels in Manchester and possibly the UK. The rooms smell of damp, the sheets are dirty, the bathroom is full of grime and somehow the kettle was already full of sewage when I arrived. After calling the lobby and asking for an explanation and a better room, I heard some giggling and was told another room was not possible. Someone was sent to change the sheets...but a different person was sent to clear out the kettle...no one came to sort the bathroom and the damp smell persisted.  I received no apology and got an apathetic response to my complaints. I even sent an email to Hilton and they have ignored this so far. Congrats on being a complete waste of space. 
-4; I noticed on arrival that the kitchen extractor fan outlet was noisy and close to the window of my room so I expressed my concern at the desk and was assured that it would be switched off by 10.00pm. The window glass was coloured white so you can't see out because the view is so appalling they don't want you to see it. At 11.30 I complained about the noise and it was switched off immediately. What they didn't mention is that is comes on again at 6.00am at which point I demanded a quiet room or I would go elsewhere for the rest of my stay. By 11.00am I was moved to another room, a double upgrade which I later discovered I was expected to pay for. I felt insulted and would never return to this hotel. The room was no more than a store cupboard and I can't believe they really think it's ok to put guests in it. 
-4; Unfortunately many errors with our stay here: 1. Nobody on reception when we arrived - 5 minute wait until someone appeared with no apology offered. 2. Wrong room allocation 3. The dirtiest corridors i have ever seen in a hotel (dodging room service trays, pizza trodden into the floor, room service trolleys blocking our way. 4. Items in the room broken or missing (shower curtain rail, trash can) 5. 10 second alarm hotel wide alarm at 6.45am with no reason given.  Having said that the rooms themselves were clean and the bed was very comfortable. I chose this hotel based on my past experiences at Raddison Blu hotels which were very good however this stay ruined those past experiences. 
-4; This hotel has to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. On checking in we asked the receptionist what time the bar closes, the reply was 24/7. We went out for a meal and returned to continue discussing our business. At 11pm the barman announced the bar was closing, this was a surprise, as the lady on reception had clearly stated the bar was open 24/7. Upon querying this with the David Durel the Duty Manager, an argument erupted thanks to his obnoxious and arrogant behavior. Mr Durel must be the most un-professional person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting in any hotel. The bar staff are excellent, just the management that needs to be trained or removed!  The rooms are over-priced but clean. However, should you wish to listen the bowel movements of all bedrooms above, please book room 107, for some strange reason the internal plumbing for toilet and bathroom waste is channeled through a loud pipe under the bath in this room. Quite shocking at 7am in the morning, especially when a thunderous sound erupts from inside the bathroom and continues until the last guest has finished their morning ritual. The bath also doesn't drain well in the room, so start out having a shower and and up standing in a bath.   Probably the worst stay I have ever encountered in my traveling career. 
-4; Had to stay here as a result of flight cancellation - it was airlines default allocation. Never had to post negative review before, but this experience was so bad I'm struggling to sum it up. Main complaint was this hotels decision to allocate our family of 4 which included 2 teenage full paying passengers into only one 1 room!!! and not a family sized room but modest twin room with really shoddy camp beds for our large children!! It was only after I challenged the fire regulations of this arrangement did duty manager find another room for us - strange because airline had booked 34 more rooms than were needed. The hotel had ignored this and carried on letting them out elsewhere. Rooms were tired, and not very clean at all. Meal was carvery and very poor by todays standards, with only meagre offering of very fatty gammon and pork complimented with bland poor veg. 
-4; Crikey, where to start? This is an interesting place to eat - if you do venture here be sure to take good friends whose company can ameliorate the ambiance and aide digestion - that provides a dank, foreboding welcome to any traveller. The bar is spartan and poorly lit. The furnishings worn and frayed. The tables sticky with the spillage from the afternoon drinking session. The glasses smudged and dirty. The food is edible. Just.   It's all a bit sad really. The Staincliffe was better that this once - it was nostalgia that prompted the visit - but it now feels like a hotel in the same way that the Express feels like a newspaper. The staff are pleasant and try to be helpful and the location is great. The chips are homespun and excellent.   The whole experience contains scenes of mild peril. You won't require Kevlar but good friends are essential. 
-4;" Where shall I start? I travel a lot and stay in a lot of hotels - various quality, but Sopwell House is supposed to be &quot;up there&quot; - Poor check in experience - I arrived 1 hour early and told no room until 3pm - Several people trying to check in at the same time and only 1 check in agent - at 1 point someone looked out the door and then closed it quickly.. - No steam iron! I traveled by train down from Manchester and the only way to press my clothes was with an flat iron - no way are my shirts and suit going to be smooth. - Asked for ironing - no  - Asked for pressing service - no - Asked what could they / we do - tell trip advisor! - I went looking for a coffee - no one around, I asked reception, and they pointed me back in the same direction I had just come from  and to top it off - room was so small, could not even walk around the bed!  Reading the other reviews it all appears great - maybe its just the business market they don't like? "
-4;Please don't waste your money on a spa day here, we were rushed through treatments, my massage lasted a total of 15 mins should have been 30 mins, room was cold, buzzing noise from a broken light fitting, charged £5 to use a robe, only provided breakfast tea and water as a refreshment, no coffee, no herbal teas as you would expect in a spa. The swimming pool area was very tired, pool was cold, no jacuzzi, no real space to relax by the pool as you would expect when a place is selling spa days. All in all spend your money elsewhere as you will be very disappointed.
-4; Have stayed at this place many times in the past and wanted to book for later in the year, only to find that now HF run the hotel and not family run as in the past, dogs are no longer welcome, either in the hotel or the self catering side. It no longer has the atmosphere it used to have and some staff appear quite scruffy. Will certainly give this place a MISS from now on 
-4; We arrived at lunch time to find the car park full, there was parking on the street but only with a two hour limit. Eventually we found a parking space but about quarter of a mile away from the hotel. The bar area was very busy and had to wait a long time for anyone to come to reception to give us our keys. At breakfast they had run out of teapots and muesli. The rooms were fine and the hotel has a great location but the staffs interest in customer satisfaction was poor. 
-4; Visited the Reading Lake Hotel for a couple of days on Business. I booked a double for single use, but was put in a twin. On putting up the toilet seat was shocked, and fairly disgusted, to find the underneath to be splattered with faeces and urine. On complaining it was explained to me, very patiently, that the room I was in hadn't been refurbished yet. I'm taking it that toilet seats get changed during a refurbishment rather than cleaned occasionally. I won't be staying there again. 
-4;" I arrived at the hotel and was given room 906, when I got to the room the TV was already on at a high volume so I never heard the noise coming from the nearby lift. I went out that evening and returned late, as I was tired I got ready and went off to bed and fell asleep pretty quick. Then at 4am in the morning all I could hear until I eventually got up at 6am was the lifts going up and down, it was soooooooooo annoying to say the least. When I checked out I asked to speak with the manager and mentioned the lifts, he was less than sympathetic and the only thing he said was &quot;oh yea they need servicing&quot;. Well I was less than impressed with his customer service skills and therefore will not use this hotel group again, it may need servicing so what I suggest you do is not sell the rooms near to the lift because I am sure I was not the first person to mention it!!!! "
-4; This hotel has an excellent location however that's the only positive part. I stayed for one night and if it was not late I would have looked elsewhere. Mouldy walls, mouldy shower curtain. Hairs in the shower and in the corner of the bathroom. The toilet had sick on the outside. The bin lorries 4 between 6 and 7 am just outside of the window. Stay away woken at 2am by drunks. Wifi none existent 
-4; The other negative reviews about this hotel should be noted as they are very true. I stayed for one night, not the best experience of my life. Lets start with check in, there are least five check-in terminals, only one was in use, 10 minute delay. The layout of the hotel feeds from a hub, rotunda, with corridors containing the bedrooms leading off this. This rotunda is used for conference drinks areas, not good when you're trying to find your room with bags, avoiding drunken DPD staff enjoying themselves.  This is a four star hotel and at £141 per night should be better, two other points to note, luke warm shower in the morning and soup spoons on the breakfast table. All in all , poor service, too busy and no attention to detail expected at a four star hotel. One star.. must improve, its only the location of being next to Magna Park and Triumph that keeps this hotel going 
-4; I stayed in this hotel in November 2012 for my partners birthday, upon arrival we were sent to our room - we weren't even shown to we're we would be staying (It doesn't take much) on the way we walked past a room that had dirty plates full of food on the landing - these plates stayed here during the duration of our stay! 3 Days!!!! Online I booked a VIP room, which I payed a lot for - clearly this was not what I received, more like a box room with just enough room to get out either side. I personally would not recommend this hotel unless things changed 
-4; We stayed in Sheffield for a wedding and booked this hotel just to get a smoking room. We paid GBP 118 already and I was surprised we had to pay another 5 for parking and to be told on arrival no rooms for smokers were available. If they couldn't guarantee a particular room type request then the internet site should give you the opportunity to cancel or they should have notified us in order to give us the opportunity to move to a different hotel. We just checked in (Room 224 on the 11 July 2009), left the luggage and didn't return to the room until after the wedding and banquet. At night I saw for the first time something amazing I had never seen before / nor expected in my entire life and I'm sure I will never ever forget:   Dirty and very worn carpets. Lots of dust in the mirror and bed frames  Rooms are poorly insulated for noise  Black marks in the ceiling paint (perhaps someone knocking with a shoe's sole because of noise in the upper room) No air conditioning other than a fan (an a Spanish fan I had with me) Very thin and wore sheets with previous customers hair under and on top of the bottom sheet. I think in fact they haven't changed the bed lining from previous bookings as they didn't smell even clean and weren't pressed Black mould in the bath, big lime scale mark in the bottom of the bath and chipped bath with grubby floor corners. Other people hair still laying inside the bath  Just one set of towels, even when the room was booked for two people At morning (We had breakfast included) I did prefer not to go for breakfast (not feeling too confident about their kitchen being clean enough) but as I need a couple of strong coffee mugs to wake up, my partner brought me a coffee from buffet. The coffee was such a disgraceful bucket of watered instant coffee I had to go to the Costa coffee shop inside the hotel only to realize it was closed (Are they fleeing the ship as well?) I then realized the hotel is not even near any facilities, so we decided to go back home to London and have a coffee in a service area on the way. Once a home I felt like having a bath and putting myself in quarantine just in case. Lesson learned, no more Hltons and next time lets go for a wonderful camping tent that would have cost half of the money we paid for this infamous night away. 
-4; The hotel blurb speaks of its 74 comfortable rooms. While I can't speak for the other 73 the room we had was minuscule and to all intents and purposes, underground. The tiny window looks out onto a stunning brick wall from whence an incessant racket can be enjoyed from the kitchen. It would appear the hotel rents this room in an effort to obtain bad reviews how could anyone feel otherwise? So I say unless you are a cave dweller if they offer you room 47 tell them to shove it where the sun doesn't shine, just the like the room itself 
-4; I bookled a meal at the restaurant as it had two AA rosettes. Upon arrival, despite the fact that I had specified that my dining partner was in a wheelchair I was told that they had changed the dining room as the normal room was being used for another function and they were using an alternative dining room on the FIRST FLOOR and there WERE NO LIFTS to access the restaurant. This is despite having made a reservation over a week in advance and specifically told them we needed access for a wheelchair. Was told I could eat in the bar, had a look and this place was literally a bar off the lobby with numerous chikldren running around playing tick in their princess dresses ( presumably from the function next door?) declined the offer in no uncertain terms. Was very angry, feel discriminated against and totally let down. If this is their idea of customer service then my advice is to give this establishment a wide berth. We telephoned Peckforton castle close by and they mada a reservation for us and we dined there in elegance and enjoyed a superb meal and service. Macdonald you should be ASHAMED of yourself. I am still considering speaking to my legal advisor regards discrimianation under the Equality Act 2010 
-4; I agree with another guest's review. A hotel should provide hot water at all times of the day. The proprietor is well aware of this and admits the water is on a timer and cannot cope if other guests use the water before you do. Sorry, but two cold showers in one day just isn't good enough. The room was shabby, the shower knob was broken, the furniture is old and basic. The bedside lamp didn't work in this room, either. The yale lock on the door was not fitted straight and did not offer the level of security one would appreciate when party-going guests arrive back in the small hours. This is very worrying as well as a disturbance. The proprietor may defend his case, but the fact is that unless you are on a stag/hen night and really don't care what the place is like, as long as you can do exactly as you please, I would avoid this hotel. An offer of a free drink from the bar didn't make up for a ruined weekend. An apology from the house keeper would have gone a long way, but no-one seemed to care. 
-4;It's in need of total renovation. Old carpets, needs painting. The rooms look like they have been cobbled together from any spare mismatching stuff. It's noisy, busy, just horrible.  The 'soul singer' they had warbling away, you had to move out of the way just to hear yourself think!  Low end hotel.  The location is good that's it.
-4;Stated at this hotel on 28th August. Room was very nice but well overpriced £189 for 1 night. Evening meal was OK but nothing to shout home about. Then we come to breakfast the following morning, the waitress was rude and ignorant, asked her to bring condiments which never turned up, ended up going and fetching them myself. The waitress while serving us stopped midway to see to another couple who she obviously knew so we just he to wait. When my breakfast finally did turn up it was revolting. I cannot remember ever having left a fry up breakfast anywhere in the world so this one is the first. Scrambled eggs must have had 1 egg in it and 2 pints of cream, never had scrambled eggs that you can consume through a straw. It was like someone had been sick on the plate. Chad potatoes never heard of these and wish I never had, boiled potatoes still in the skins with onions on the top, absolutely horrid. Only had 1 taste of the scrambled eggs and the potatoes, wish I had never swallowed as I was ill all day with an upset stomach. Eat here at your peril. Absolutely rubbish
-4; We stayed for 2 nights in a standard room and the room was so small we felt cluster phobic and the room was in no way homely. Storage was very limited, this together with the very uninviting room meant we did not even unpack. How to operate the bath/shower was not that obvious and difficult to use without getting into the bath. On the positive, the room was very clean and the breakfast was good although the restaurant could not cope with the throughput on the Saturday morning. We would not dream of staying here again, the Premier Inn County Hall at half the price is much better. 
-4; In the area and found the hotel on the HH app. Booked and got a reasonable rate for what looked like a country golf hotel. Without writing an essay - dusty room, marks on the walls, curtains missing off curtain rails in public areas, torn wallpaper, unclean floors in the breakfast area. Never again !! 
-4; Location was good, but noise from outside really loud, even with double glazing! The first room that was offered was adjacent to an extractor fan, which was really loud, so changed to a room on the second floor, which was much better, but still not up to the price to which you pay? A charge of £16 per night for parking, even for myself, being disabled I though this was wrong, as I had no option of parking else where?  An email was sent to me to say of Valentines dinner menu, but none of the outage of some of the leisure facilities? Which was annoying, as this was the reason the hotel was booked!  The breakfast is really good, in relation to choice of food on offer, the dinning room was really nice too. Can't comment on the dinner menu, as both myself or partner didn't fancy the menu, a little poor and over priced. Got charged for wifi, although this was supposed to be in the price, didn't notice on checking out due to the difficulty in breaking down of the bill, really confusing, plus I didn't have it until I had paid! The public areas of the hotel are mixed, the front of house is bit dim, in relation to the lighting, especially the reception desk. The carpets and paint work in the public areas is tired. The rooms, bedrooms are nice, but the bathrooms are tired, dark colour scheme, poorly lit, and the water slow to go down the plug hole, a sign of dirty pipe work. Then asked via email to carry out a review of the hotel by Marriot, to which I did, but review yet to be put on the web site? Not a luxury hotel by any means, really do your home work before booking.  Would I stay in this hotel again? No. 
-4;" Well, what can I say? We booked our stay here through our friend's recommendation and advice as she said it was marvellous; we obviously have extremely different standards. We booked the LQ luxury getaway, and on reflection, it is hard to see the luxurious side of it.  The room was extremely substandard, with: mould around the shower nozzle; damp smell in the room; £50 upgrade for champagne and strawberries - champagne bottle was around £15-£20 net cost, so they were extremely expensive strawberries; and, the double bed was to singles pushed together, plus the room was tiny! Overall the room was a massive let down.   Food was, in fairness, exceptional. Problem here was getting someone's attention; we waited for 30 minutes after our dessert to ascertain whether we could leave or had to sign something.  So after we left we decided to get a drink in the bar, as it had a lovely coal fire lit and was quite cosy and ambient. There were two tables in there and both were covered in a vast array of glasses and plates - which I had to move myself, otherwise we wouldn't have had a place to sit. After 5 minutes looking at drinks, we made up our minds and went to the bar to order. 40 minutes later we're still in the bar area, just minus drinks. My wife went to reception to see if anyone was serving, to which the receptionist rang someone and told us they're on their way. 15 minutes later the receptionist comes over and I quote, asks: &quot;what do you want?&quot;. Had I not been biting my tongue, my reply would have been &quot;a member of staff with a little bit more etiquette and respect&quot;. However, we just placed out order, and that was that.  5 minutes later my wife's drink turned up, but mine didn't as I was told they didn't have any. the reason I asked for my drink was that I had seen it behind the bar. Luckily, I managed to get my drink.  On that note we finished our drink and went to bed.  Next morning the breakfast was, in my then opinion, the hotel's redeeming feature: wrong. My wife opted for pastries, which she enjoyed until she bit one that contained raw dough. My wife reported this, but after 20 minutes, the raw pastries were still on show.  However, the spa is very good - and it is manned by extremely helpful and polite staff. It is not in any way mitigation for the appalling standards endured in the hotel.  You should thoroughly ashamed that you charge so much money, for such poor standards. We would normally have stayed at the Doubletree in Chester, but thought we'd give you a try; as a result we're £250 down - which we know we won't get back, nor will we get what should've been, a special weekend back either.  Cherry on the cake is I left a filled-out feedback card in the room with the express instruction to be contacted. Guess what? Yup, they haven't contacted us.  Avoid and just drive the extra 20 odd miles to Chester!! "
-4;" Oh dear.  Booked this hotel 6 months ago for an overnight stay as we had also booked a show at the BIC. Tuned up before the allotted check-in time, so had a coffee in the bar while we waited. 20 minutes for coffee, so the bar man offered it complementary. (not a great start)  Our room was on the 3rd floor, and the lift is broken, awaiting refurbishment. so slogged up there with our case. When we got to the room, there was too much road noise (due to bad windows) for my wife to expect to sleep, and NO DOOR ON THE BATHROOM. Asked to for an alternative room, which they found on the fourth floor (bit more exercise with our case ;-) only to find... No heating and no water at all out of the hot tap had to call reception on my mobile, because there is no phone in that room. (bathroom window was also very rotten)  They offered to send a maintenance man up to fix the plumbing issues, but we had had enough, found alternative accommodation, and checked out, an hour after we got into our first room, and expect a full refund.  Overheard other guests complaining about various things, and pity the staff there, who, in all fairness were trying to put things right, but let down by the appalling state of repair of the building.  Other reviewers seem to have had better experience, and maybe we were unlucky, but we are seasoned travellers, and agreed that this was about the worst hotel either of us had ever stayed in.  4-star hotel - what a joke.  Our advice - find something a bit better. "
-4; average food, average sevrice, cold restauirant, over priced. Slow service, foood not cooked to requirements, asked for coffee after meal, stil waiting for promised fudges. The reception ares was'an not warm but not completely cold, but when dierecteded to restuararant was led into cold room, service was slow will nevwer go there again 
-4;" I try to always find the positives in an experience to help other potential customers as I know everyone has a bad day!! I am afraid the positives are limited to I liked the Xmas music.   Here are the negatives:  1. Parking has a high level of theft; warning signs everywhere 2. Arrived in the bar and the waitress called Niva was on her own and struggling. 3. The chef raised an issue with our having our afternoon tea without booking; although we did and reception didn't tell the chef. 4. Worst of all this was the afternoon tea food. 1 sandwich in size but cut into 4 with 2 flavours, ham and cheese and cucumber. The bread was dry and the cucumber cut as thinly as the chef could make it. The scones were a high, nice and warm, but with some thin biscotti slices on top, there was no value to the £45 paid. The clotted cream had hard slices in it raising a concern how many people it had been put in front of... 5. Labelled as a champagne afternoon tea, be prepared for the half glass of prosecco - and I had to open the bottle to save the waitress from an embarrassing cork in the eye. 6. The service was poor; no one at the bar, seemingly quiet service, however when I asked for a refill on the prosecco (paid for!!!) I was told to come to the bar...so silly. Why not wander down and offer a top up and then add it to the bill? Make customers lives easy and they spend more!!!  The experience felt as if the Hotel had run a promotion to attract new customers but failed in the delivery with poor service and a cost cutting exercise on food and drink. The hotel should focus on blowing away their customers once they get them in and watch them come back. Sadly they did the opposite and tried to make a profit out of a loss leader and now has this review. I would never return and would strongly suggest if you do decide to go, lower your expectations to save disappointment. "
-4;Stay here for business a couple of days ago.room cold and only a small heater in the room. Tv had poor picture as the tube inside was on the way out.bathroom tired and not very clean. Room smelt stale and had to have the patio door open to get some fresh air in. Restaurant if you can call it that was empty but all the tables had reserved on them for who I wonder. I think on the whole sleeping in the car would have been a better experience.
-4;This place could be so good but seems to be ran very poorly touring is not properly set out just pitch how you want the wash/ toilet facilities are not adequate in both numbers and cleanliness the pub and cafe / restaurant are dirty /grubby staff just stand around ( get a cloth in your hand and have a good clean) outside ash trays remain full tables sticky dont look like they have been wiped all year this has caused a influx of wasps this is really dissipointing because the views are breath taking the lakes and associated facilities are also very good this is very frustrating as has the potential to be outstanding 
-4; I have stayed at this hotel when it first opened and was owned by Nigel Mansell and it was perfectly acceptable, however, the new owner are running this on a budget and it shows.  Tired rooms and dark room, uncomfortable bed and the whole place smells like an old peoples home!  Upon arrival we wanted a drink and went to the main bar and were greeted by Dan, the most uninspiring and sullen character you could ever wish to meet. No feedback, no smile, nothing.   In the evening we had a table at the Atrium restaurant and again were greeted by a sullen looking manager who asked if we booked, there was only one other couple in the whole restaurant, and were advised that we should have boked but that he could find a table for us!  We had home cooked bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar but the bread was terrible and ended up like a ball of putty in your mouth. Just some cheap bought in bread that was at beast reheated.   Our main course was chicken wrapped in Parma ham which was so overcooked that it was dry and leathery!  Breakfast took an age to be delivered and was disappointing. My full English was barely acceptable and my wife's scrambled eggs was a watery mush that was inedible  Nobody ever asked if we were happy or liked the food and when we complained, it just fell on deaf ears. No feedback or emotion!  All in all a four star hotel that is resting on it's former laurels and is now being run on budget befitting a two star B&B 
-4; I have just returned from a stay at the Hallmark BH2 5JS, the room was dirty, the shower didn't work very well, I had a chicken and bacon sandwich via room service which was dreadful.  The Room was far to hot, the fan didn't work, you could hear every sound from the next room.  And the decor as with the cleaning was from decades ago.   The good points is the location, 
-4; It took three attempts to place a room service order. The first time it just rang and rang and I gave up. Second time it rang and rang and was picked up and immediately put down. Third time I rang reception who didn't seem very surprised or interested. An apology for my inconvenience would have been nice. I have to say I don't think I will stay here again. Food finally arrived and was distinctly average. Not impressed. 
-4; Booked the East Cliff back in July this year for 1 night to see a concert at the BIC, room was £102 for a twin bed room as that was all that was showing when booked online but did include breakfast. Got there at 13:00 but room not ready until 15:00 so went for a stroll into Bournemouth. Booked in and I was asked to pay for the room again to which I pulled out the credit card invoice to show that my card had already been debited. Went to room and all I can say that it was probably the smallest room that my wife and I have ever had to stay in. No point trying to ask for another room as I tried to book the previous night but was informed that the Hotel was fully booked Friday and Saturday due to a Gala ball. On a positive it did have a double bed but it was against the wall so you could only get into it from one side. The bathroom door opened out into the bedroom and made it impossible to pass each other, the tea making facilities were on a tray under a small desk and there was no way that the tray could be removed as the desk was tight against the bed. We managed to take the items from the tray but only two teabags and two milk cartons, so no morning cuppa. Got into the bath and then realised we only had one towel, quick call to housekeeping soon sorted that out. Whilst lying in the bath I then noticed dried Faeces on the toilet rim (under the lid) I sprayed with shaving foam but it was still there when we left and probably still there now, no excuse for this and thank god we were only staying one night. Morning breakfast was a complete nightmare too many people not enough tables, a wait of 20 mins to get a table then a queue to get breakfast, hotel run out of plates and most of the items that go to make up a full English breakfast were not available such as eggs. Got back to table and all cutlery gone, the waitress thought we had finished and was arranging for someone else to sit at table, I would have thought leaving the room and car keys on table meant that we were still having breakfast. Booked out and nothing from reception regarding how was your stay so left it at that but I have completed the Hotel questionnaire and posted back today. So I will update if I receive a response back. Room 1019 is only a single room not a double if you stay here, and for management can I suggest you look at the emergency procedures card on the back of the door you may want to correct it. 
-4; Stayed here Monday to Friday rooms disgusting mould around shower, dirty carpets with cigeret burns very badly cleaned, friends also stayed next door and their room was just as bad. On the Wednesday had to change rooms because of an ant infestation so was upgraded to gold, moved all our belongins to find the gold apartment already occupied, so had to return to a silver above the old one but this apartment had internal stairs not good with a 1 year old so was provided with a stair gate, Entertaiment was good but water was leaking badly through the roof and made the room very smelly and wet. There is alot of foreign staff and some can be rude. Had a bad meal in the sun and moon restaurant on site and the portion size was very bad for the prices also in the skyline the prices of alcohol seemed to creep up at night. I think butlins is like marmite you either love it or hate it, and I didn't enjoy the experience. 
-4;" Where do I start!   On arrival everything looks pleasant but when you look closer the place is falling apart, staff unhelpful and boarder line rude, restaurant food mediocre at best &quot;don't order room service because the food gets even worse&quot; decor needs TLC and is very dated, on my final night the fire alarm went off at 6:05am in the morning (it lasted 15 minutes) I raised this with the receptionist on check out, and said how tired I was because of this early wake up call! He wasn't interested and wasn't bothered by my complaint! WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN! "
-4; My girlfriend and I booked a room at Tonge Barn a couple of months in advance for our friend's wedding taking place nearby. When we arrived, we were initially told that we were not on the bookings (we had booked through hotels.com). After some deliberation Steve (the owner I think) made a room available for us. It was an internal room, with a view of the corridor, not the garden room (with a view of the garden) that I had booked and payed for. When I asked for a discount due to wrong room/ no view, Steve completely refused. Even a token amount like £10 would have been a nice gesture - absolutely nothing. There were no other rooms available.  Late that night when we arrived back after the wedding and about to get into bed, we were very disappointed to find that the sheets had not been cleaned. There was a bloodstain, and the sheets were full of hairs. I went to the reception, but being so late (12.45am) it was locked up and there was nobody around. We paid £75 to sleep in a dirty bed.  The next morning Steve was not around, and I decided not to take up my complaint with the helpful receptionist who was busy cooking breakfast for everyone.  Great location, full of character and charm, but clearly bad management and lack of care for the customer. The breakfast was delicious though. 
-4;" We stayed in The Shelleys on the nights of 26th and 27th August at a rate of £345 per night for bed and breakfast.  Unfortunately we checked TripAdvisor after we started to experience substandard quality. (Note to selves - always check TripAdvisor before booking. We normally do but for some reason this time we didn't.)  We had booked the Pelham Suite which is a large room, ie: not a suite. We specifically booked this hotel to celebrate a special weekend. The experience in this hotel very nearly ruined the celebration.  In chronological order the problems were: Carpet in the room stained Empty bath/shower gel bottle No hand soap in bathroom NB: this was provided by the receptionist/waitress very quickly Black mould around sink Shower cubicle had not been cleaned Shower fitting was from a bygone age  In the afternoon we asked the receptionist/waitress for a pot of tea for two, with biscuits to be served in the garden. The tea arrived, without the milk or biscuits, eventually we went back inside to ask for these two items, receptionist/waitress apologised.  And so to breakfast: The porridge was like a scene from Goldilocks. The first bowl was too sweet. We explicitly asked for no sugar. The second was too runny, undercooked oats and barely warm. The third bowl was one solid lump. The waiter foresaw this and provided a jug of cold milk, so that my wife could &quot;loosen it up a bit.&quot; My wife did say to the waiter she wasn't making a fuss but was a diabetic. Third bowl was never eaten, but she went to the main serving table and got some rice pops.  Sunday morning: We noticed the night before that the soap had disappeared, so had to use our own shower gel. Halfway through the first shower (whilst fully soaped up) the water ran cold. This meant a cold wash and shave. My wife at this point had not showered and rang reception, to be told there had been a power cut during the night and that she didn't know when this would be fixed as the boiler maintenance man, didn't come from Lewes, my wife mentioned that we needed to get home, where she said it could be 5 minutes, it didn't make sense.  Any one of the above taken in isolation would not have been a problem. However all of the above made this a thoroughly miserable experience. One which will never be repeated.  NB: The manager was not available to speak to at check out time, but would be available Monday.   "
-4; Stayed at this hotel because of the reasonable price, inclusive breakfast and location close to Ashbourne where we had an appointment early the next day. We stayed for one night and arrived at around 9:30pm after travelling for four hours from home. As we arrived at the hotel car park we could hear the music from what was obviously a Christmas party inside, reasonable enough at this time of year but the volume was excessive by any standards. We then went to check in and the music was spilling out of the function room so loudly that the receptionist could not hear us to check us in! Eventually we managed to get our room key. We were told that breakfast was not served until 7:30am and I advised the receptionist that we had paid for breakfast and had to leave at 7am and asked if there was an alternative, she advised us that we could order breakfast to our room at an additional cost of £20 each! When we got to the room it was outdated and dirty. I did not want to sleep in the bed and the curtains and sofa were filthy. The party downstairs went on until 1am and it was so loud that the walls were vibrating. Once the music ended we were then able to hear the traffic on the main road so loudly we could have been sleeping in a lay-by on the m6! After very little sleep we woke up to have a shower. Unsurprisingly the shower was a dribble at best and the temperature was constantly changing from scalding hot to freezing cold without warning. We checked out without sleep, without breakfast and less than happy with our stay we were asked by the receptionist if we had enjoyed our stay and we politely explained our issues. He asked for our phone number so that the manager could call us regarding our stay and one month later I am still waiting for a call! To summarise - avoid at all costs this is not a 4 star hotel as advertised! 
-4; I have stayed at the Thistle on several occasions due to work activities and I am often underwhelmed.  I have encountered many issues of which several times I have had to escalate concerns.  Twice I have received either the wrong food order and once my starter and ain course came at the same time.  I had an issue where the air conditioning unit (located above my bed.......) leaked all over me at 4am. Not a great experience!!!  The menu is dull and lacks inspiration.  A lot of the rooms are and in need of modernisation. IE plug sockets away from the bed, so difficult to charge your phone overnight whilst using it to set an alarm.  Its an ideal location for my workplace but a disappointing hotel. 
-4; Nice hotel. Great location. Good rooms. Worst staff I have ever encountered at any hotel in the world - rude, arrogant and not interested in the least about what a customer may want. It's strange really, this used to be the George Hotel which had great staff but was very tired as a building. The building is now great but the staff are now awful. Great shame. Avoid!! 
-4; Smallest room I've ever stayed in. Very dangerous room as stair well in bedroom.also was awaken on a couple of occasions by someone ringing door bell early on Sunday morning.this was at nine in the morning by the time I had got dressed the person had disappeared. This happened again ten minutes later. Not good enough. 
-4; The food was dreadful, that bad that although it was paid for us we still chose to go to a KFC the following day instead of eating in the restaurant. And why do they offer activities for children? The football game was broke, the video game was broke and worst of all children aren't allowed in the Spar or in the pool after 6!!! Most people aren't even at the hotel before 6 and when we wanted to go in, it was completely empty but the jobs worthy's wouldn't let my girls swim so why does the Holiday Inn hate children so much, these are their future customers, We had to leave our day out early the following day just so my girls could swim and there are clear signs to not dive or jump in the pool but all the adults was doing it, my girls never, they are better behaved so why does this hotel consider adults more important? 
-4;I imagine that someone has seen a 4 star hotel and tried to recreate it from scratch. It's acceptable on the surface, but nothing quite hangs together, the rooms were a bit grubby in the corners, the changing rooms were rather down-at-heel. The food is terrible, really terrible, (don't eat there, honestly), the drink mediocre and overpriced. They had some bottles of bottle-conditioned beer, it was served from the fridge and poured with the sediment, when I complained, I was told that that was how it should be served. Salad served with a sandwich was old and lifeless, it had leaves that were rotting and brown. The nachos were pretty unappetising. We were behind the bar, next to the kitchen exit, both nights at around midnight they came to the top of the stairs and threw the rubbish bags into the skips in the yard. Go to a Travelodge, it won't be worse than this. I contacted the hotel to give them time to respond, they haven't bothered. The staff just don't seem to be engaged, there seems to be a management problem at this hotel.
-4; Tried to book for a large family get together in April for my mums 80th Birthday but despite wanted to book 2 rooms Fri and 7 rooms Sat...I hit a brick wall. This is after two telephone calls and an email. No-one at the hotel wanted to help even when I explained my father has limited mobility, and that we would be staying in the hotel for the whole stay, would be having all our food and drink on site. It seems 14 paying guests is of little consequence so I will find a hotel that wants our business. This booking would have run well into the thousands but Titanic don't want our custom. Inow have to explain to my mum why her planned party won't be at her hotel of choice. 
-4; Went to a lovely wedding here, lovely place, really pleased for the bride and groom. On buying a pint of lager a gin lime and lemonade plus a pint of soda water and lime for the designated driver! 3 drinks total bill £25.75!!! Thought the barman was joking at first, how much is the lager I asked £4.50 he responded, that's more than £10 per drink for the remaining 2 drinks I retorted. 2 small bottles of soda water to fill said pint glass, @ £3.75 each and £1.00 for a dash of lime! £8.50 for a pint of soda water and lime! He responded that these prices were correct £8.75 for a shot of gin £3.00 for a small bottle of lemonade and a pound for the. Dash of lime! I was so looking forward to a great night to find myself being so angry at being ripped off we left almost immediately. Don't forget to remortgage if having a night of drinking with family and friends!,, on the way home we stopped of at a bar where the driver had a soda and lime at the more reasonable price of 65 pence. Did actually think about having my daughters wedding here too until my visit.. Rip off 
-4; Sent a request email/booking for a notable anniversary, checking availability.. 3 weeks later, didn't even bother replying. Tried to contact to view accommodation.. CLOSED! Chose Bangkok Brasserie - TOTALLY unforgettable service and AMAZING food even though they were jam packed!!! Need we say more? 
-4;We booked at the Crowne Plaza for both outbound and inbound flights. The evening before we flew was ok with the room being of reasonable standard and our only grumble being the cost of food and drink, which it seems you have to expect at airport hotels.  The return flight on New Years Eve was a completely different story, we walked into a full blown riot with police, screaming women and drunks punching seven bells out of each other. My wife was terrified and thus we spent the new year in our room, she did not sleep all night and just wanted to leave as quickly as possible.  I will not go into exact details but the bottom line was that the hotel carried on selling alcohol to people who were not in a state to take any more and had called the police on our first arrival but continued to serve.  The next morning we were not even given an apology and indeed have heard nothing from the hotel, which demonstrates to me that they really didn't give a tink, therefore please strongly consider your position when staying with hotel group.
-4;Awful from arrival to leaving. Spent £235 on suite to look at office block, when could have paid less for room with view Having ordered food in bar waited over 1 hour and all 4 meals were wrong including under cooked chips, cold fish fingers, cucumber in sandwich despite being told wife was allergic, and who arrived as taken away and simply cucumber taken out Hotel a joke and will not go back
-4; We booked a 2 night stay using wowcher and arrived at Nent Hall on 29th July. The initial impression was good and Naomi made us feel very welcome. We were then shown to our room which appeared tired and dated. On further inspection we discovered numerous faults which you would certainly not expect to find in a 4 star hotel.  Bathroom was dirty, flaking paint on walls, mould round the bath, clumps of dust on the floor. Curtains in room were ripped and falling off rail so that it was almost impossible to close them. 'Wardrobe' was an alcove with a rail in it, no doors or even a curtain on it. General appearance of room was tatty, paint peeling off walls, light bulbs missing and stained carpet. It felt like we had been put in a sub-standard room but we decided to try and make the best of it. We ate in the bar that evening and the steak was good. Part way through the meal another customer came into the bar with a labrador. The staff on duty made a big fuss of the dog stroking it and giving it biscuits and then proceedeed to serve customers straight away. There was no way that they could have washed their hands. This was the final straw, we had travelled for 3 hours to stay in a 4 star hotel and had been subjected to inferior standards from the outset.  Unfortunately, Naomi had gone off duty and had been replaced by Adele who we found exteremly loud. We did not want to voice our concerns to her as she had actually been stroking the dog in the bar. We spent a very uncomfortable night in our room (we would have left straight away but had had a drink so was unable to drive). We were so upset by the situation that we spoke to Naomi the next morning, we wouldn't even have breakfast as we were so unsure about the hygeine standards. Naomi was brilliant and spent time listening to all our concerns. She arranged an immediate refund through Wowcher and said she would pass our comments to the owner and was sure that we would be offered a stay in one of their hotels in Lincoln. We have been waiting since then to hear from Jonathan Pass but despite reminders he has not been in touch. It would appear that we were unlucky as I have read many favourable comments about Nent Hall. I think it is a shame that Mr Pass has chosen to ignore our concerns, we have waited long enough. 
-4; To all readers. Please forgive this lengthy review, but these facts need to be known about this hotel. At a recent wedding I attended, the staff were attentive and terrific. End of praise.   In order to guarantee a room to attend a wedding, I booked two full priced nights a year in advance. They take 50% deposit which means they had the use of my money for 12 months with no interest! How wrong I was. I should have waited and booked a weekend break through TravelZoo, Saga or many other third party websites to save at least 60%. There's always better offers available if you still insist on staying. Buyers beware, this place is a rip-off. Despite protestations once I found out about the offers, they weren't interested in coming to a price compromise. The arrogant owner (Stephen Baker) only deals through his PA, and, by the way, you may have noticed that he doesn't respond to any comments (good or bad) on this website.   I had a so called 'superior' room with a sea view. There was nothing superior about it. The bathroom was OK, but a shower within the bath tub is hardly superior. Beds are quite hard, and the decor is geared towards the over 70's - most of whom had huge trouble climbing the staircase. The staircase to the second floor (no lift) is unbelievably tatty with a threadbare carpet, and the corridors are dark, dingy and ridiculously hot. The wifi up there is almost non existent, and the staff at reception weren't at all surprised! A fellow traveller also had a so called superior room that was hardly bigger than a broom cupboard  The modern Spa is OK but can only be reached through the dining room, or when a function is on via the outside path - not so great when it's windy and raining! The heated outdoor pool is about three strokes long, and the treatments are stupidly over priced. As the Spa is modern and contemporary, many younger couples may be falsely lured to this basically old fashioned place, albeit in a wonderful setting.  This hotel holds a lot of weddings April to September at all times of the week. Other residents are sidelined to other parts of the hotel, and of course noisy parties continue until midnight. They don't tell you this when you book. The new Beach Bar is stupidly expensive with a tiny and mediocre Americano coffee costing £3.50.Save your money and go to nearby St.Ives where you can enjoy a sensibly priced coffee on the harbour wall.  I also have an issue with the website pricing. It must be one of only a handful of hotels in the UK where the tariff is priced per person per night, rather than per room per night. I believe that it's deliberately misleading. I can assure all readers, that the photos on the website are substantially enhanced.   In summary, I cannot honestly advise anyone to stay here. There are far better value places in Cornwall - in fact only half a mile away is the Boskerris Hotel which is a caringly family owned hotel and is an oasis of tranquility with lovely contemporary rooms. Most rooms also have stunning sea views.   Thanks for reading this, and I hope it sways you not to stay here. 
-4;" We decided to book this hotel partly due to it's proximity to a wedding we were attending. We had 2 double rooms. One for my wife and I and a room for another couple we've been friends with for many years.  On arrival, we were welcomed by friendly staff and the whole process was efficient. We left our luggage at reception as our room wasn't ready. After a great time at the wedding we returned to check-in to our room and the night porter was very friendly and efficient.  The room was all that I've come to expect from the Staybridge brand; well equipped, clean, spacious and comfortable. I've stayed at Staybridge suites in Liverpool, Newcastle and Stratford for both business and leisure since the brand came over here a few years ago.  We had a nice relaxed breakfast the next morning and checked out ready to leave a glowing report for the hotel. Well that was until I received a call from the front desk claiming a solitary full length curtain had been stolen from our friends room and accusing them of taking it!!! I gave them the contact details of our friends and explained that this was the first I'd heard of it and rejected the suggestion. Having spoken to our friends they told me the hotel was threatening to charge them for a replacement but a decision would taken on Tuesday when the Housekeeping Manager was back in (after the Bank Holiday weekend). Now on Thursday still no word from the hotel in the way of an explanation or apology.  Having stayed at various IHG hotels over the last 13+ years I've been a member of their loyalty schemes; whether that be Priority Club Rewards or now IHG Rewards Club, I've never experienced such appalling customer service. Such as shame as the rest of the experience was excellent. "
-4;I visited this hotel/restaurant on the evening of Sunday 30th December.  When phoning to make the reservation I confirmed that an ala carte menu would be available. When my 3 guests and I arrived we were told to sit in the lounge and somebody would be with us in a few moments - 15 mins later no sign of any waiting staff !! I went to the bar and asked had I understood correctly or should I still be waiting in the lounge? After some thought she told me to return to my seat and she would send somebody, OK 8 mins later a kid arrived and took our drinks order. 2 campari sodas served in a half pint glass, so much soda that you weren't sure if they had actually remembered to put the Campari in or not, a gin and tonic - no ice or lemon, having plonked them on the table, he returned with 4 beer mats and put them in the middle of the table, and kindly advised us these were our beer mats !!  I asked if we could see some menus, a young waiter arrived, more mud on his shoes than I have on my dog-walking wellies !! He proceeded to give me 3 menus, I pointed out that there was four of us !! It didn,t sink in that we might need another menu. Having looked at the Menu (far from ala carte! but a set Sunday evening meal) I decided enough was enough, and we paid for the drinks and went to THE BELL at Monks Kirby, Incredible meal was then had by all.  Such a shame that MACDONALD hotels don't realise the scope they have with such a beatiful building and setting,
-4; This hotel is tired and it is not even an old building. Staff at front desk are arrogant and have attitude of 'this is London aren't we great'. Customer experience very poor asked 3 times for help received corporate reply' we want u to have a good customer experience, we endeavour to help'. Well start putting words into action! Manager never bothered to contact me when requested 3 times! I will never be back. The breakfast was a disgrace can't believe it is a French owned company as the French are so particular about their food. Dirty rooms this hotel is more like a hostel with fancy furniture and architecture which has never been replaced or upkept. There is so much good competition hotel won't last long. 
-4; I arrived at the hotel around 10.30pm to find the front door shut. It was quickly openend butthe two memebers of staff on duty were sharing bar duties with reception duties. My room was cold when I arrived and the damper on the door was stuck so to clsoe it the door had to be forced shut. There was mould around the main window and the wall paper was begining to peel at the joints. The bathroom was in need of modernisation 
-4; Was booked to stay here for 1 night before and after our holiday to Mauritious, on arrival for the stay before flying out we where greeted by someone who clearly wanted to be somewhere else, after checking in we where the pointed in the general direction of our room, I say room but it could have just been a cupboard with a bed I can honestly say I have never stayed in a smaller room. Before going to the restaurant for our evening meal we decided to have a drink in the bar first but after spending 10 minutes trying to find someone to serve us, food was OK if you like Turkish food but very slow service. On return even after a 16 hour journey back and having already paid for our stay we decided it would be better to drive for 4 hours back to Manchester than to stay there again. 
-4;"I stay in hotels for around 100 nights/year. The vast majority of my reviews are very positive and I look for the good in every place I stay. However, from check-in to check-out at this hotel, I found the staff to be disinterested, if not completely ignorant. For example, I sat in the restaurant for over 20 minutes and still could not order a second drink, despite staff repeatedly walking past me as I politely said &quot;excuse me&quot; - I waited for over half an hour just to request my bill and in the end had to walk out. Funnily enough, this grabbed staff attention immediately and I was greeted with an abrupt &quot;sir you pay now&quot;. At the bar (it seemed I would need to get my own drink, table service in the restaurant was clearly beyond this hotel) staff struck up conversations with each other mid-way through serving my drink. In fairness, staff were incredibly friendly at the front desk, as they enthusiastically persuaded me to upgrade my room for £30 - this would allow me to get a free drink in the hotel club lounge. However, alcoholic drinks finished being served at 7:30pm. I arrived in my room at 7:30pm!"
-4; For the second time in 3 visits we were served cold food. For this there is no excuse, how can you serve cold veg and cold mash. The beef pie turned out to be mince, this plus the lamb pie were barely warm. The ladies had rack of lamb that turned out to be unchewable, uncuttable and utterly tasteless. One barman and two waiting staff struggled to cope on a busy Thursday night. We arrived not too late at app 7. Even by this time the waiter looked worn out and frazzled so that when I asked him to tell the chef that he was serving cold food and inedible rack of lamb, he just looked even more weary and fed up. We made our feelings quite clear with real politeness, and left. Next job to wrote a formal letter to the owners/management and tell them how awful it was. 
-4; Firstly try to drive into the place, really awkward, then you get stung for a 12 pounds overnight parking charge, they tell you to pay at the machine when you leave, and then charge you on the bill. My wife and left separately so neither of us aware of what they had done. When we arrived only two persons on check in at 3pm in the afternoon, busy time, so you simply have to line up and wait,and wait, and wait, very annoying. No tea/coffee making facility in any room, great have to buy it, at exorbitant cost. The only saving grace was the food in the restaurant.  Airport hotels are always in a situation which allows them to get away with most anything. 
-4; We had a really horrible one half a night. My wife and my nineteen year old lad came for a break at Minehead.  We thought the nineties evening would be something my son could see and wander across to, and we could spend sometime visiting the area.  We had no idea nearly 7000 people most of which were already completely drunk were heading for Butlins.  The people were taking drugs as well, and were really intimidating. We had people hammering at the window at 2.30 am in the morning and trying the lock  We literally ran to our car which someone had vommitted over .   We drove back home- there was no security on the gate- frankly awfu 
-4; We stayed with another couple over the May weekend and liked the spacious rooms, friendly staff and excellent breakfast. One jarring note....parking is extra at £8 per day.....come on Radisson Blu, include it in the package price! 
-4; Stayed 1 night as working near Heathrow on business, lots of building work going on, but only on reception from what i can see. Stayed in a ground floor room. Room was tired, poor decorating, uncomfortbale bed, air conditioning was noisy and just blew out hot air, no cooling, I opened the window and the handle was hanging off the frame, bathroom was poor quality, the toilet barely flushed !!! the worse 'brand' hotel I have ever stayed in.  I checked in at 11pm after checked out at 8am, if it was earlier I checked in I would have left the hotel and found an alternative, I have sent a complaint email as the website never mentioned oingoing work. 
-4; Booked stoke place for a nice romantic night to find the garden room to be absolutely shocking ,the TV didn't work ,cupboard door hanging off ,dirty foot marks on the wall ,depressing colour scheme ,garden area overgrown .4 star more like 2 star. Didn't bother staying checked in and checked out thanks for ruining my weekend great job stoke place 
-4;" I asked for the room rate before leaving home but could not confirm as our plans were unclear. We did end up there but the £85 room we hoped for was let so we accepted an offer for a smaller room with a double bed for £70 for the three of us (our daughter is 8). Just enough room but not a comfy bed and spare camp beds were in use. In the morning the owner seemed quite dismissive of us and was condescending to our daughter. Whilst waiting for my wife at reception he was openly counting out his money and ignoring my pleasantries. I found this quite vulgar. When it came to settling the bill he said they did not accept amex. I explained my surprise as unbeknown to him we had paid our security deposit that way. He grumbled that amex charge a lot, then looking at his bill for dinner I said with an ironic smile that so did he. He then dropped the mask and said of his quite pleasant receptionist &quot;Well you really did a job on her last night, as I wouldn't have let you have that room for seventy pounds&quot;. I replied &quot;How dare you speak to me like that? Who do you think you are?&quot; He had no reply to this and we walked out. "
-4; At 1:20am, having had no sleep due to deep bass rumbling through my room from the party downstairs, and guests constantly running up and down the hallway shouting and screaming, I went to reception to ask when the music would be finishing. 5am.... I was told. This is not a hotel, it is a nightclub. Hotels, I am led to believe, are places where people can sleep. 
-4;Having sat for 20 mins without even being acknowledged at our reserved table I caught the attention of a waitress. She took our order but had to be prompted to take a drinks order. She never did bring the wine list or jug of water so we ordered directly from the bar having sat for 45 mins! A sharing platter for starters was delivered as ordered but no plates ( the waiter presented the platter and went to get plates they never arrived) Our mains took just under 1 1/2 hours after we first sat down, when we politely enquiries we were told ' we are working on it just relax' at this point we should have gone with our instincts and cancelled our order and left! A VERY disappointing experience.
-4; The website was promissing, nice pictures, good reviews on tripadvisor, but what a dirty hotel! Arrived in a clean reception, nice parkingspace on the cathedral house. We have booked in the older hotel, not in the new part. When we arrived at the sidebuilding and opend the door, the smell was terribel, blood on the walls, the carpet over the place wasn't cleaned in I think over 5 years... The room was spacious, but the toilet leaked on the ground, beds have old matrasses, and felt almost apart. Heating was broken. Sheets were cleaned, but was the older sheets from the new hotel, the stains from the year before you could still see. The day after that, the toilet was fixed,....., but was leaking heaver then before on the ground... Breakfast was normal, not exeptional. And then I'm not speaking from the aironoise, and noise of the waterpump, that was like a train moving next to your room.... No spare room available, we did receive a small reduction on the total price, but that's it. The only positive was that you can visit and walk around the Cathedral grounds, but that's it. That was our 2nd worst hotel visit in the UK, after the Burston at Folkestone, but there was the fungus very good present.... Disapointment all the way!!! note I don't speak for the new part of the hotel, could be better... 
-4; A Novotel is supposed to be a decent quality mid-market 4-star hotel. this was anything but. Dinner - the restaurant looked like the interior of a 1970's Little Chef - red plastic tables and a menu to match. We walked out and chose the TGI opposite. Hotel is badly in need of a refurbishment - worn carpets, dated decor, again a 1970's style bathroom. bed was so uncomfortable, huge indent in middle of a very uncomfortable matress so we just rolled to the middle of the bed.  Noise all night in corridor with people shouting + running up + down. checkout - one girl trying to check out a queue at 8.00am that was never less than 5-6 people. She couldnt explain why there was no one else there to help her. Symptomatic of a bad hotel, badly managed. Not worth anywhere near what I paid - would save mysef half the cost next time and pick a premier Inn or Ibis and get better! Would not stay there again. 
-4; Rooms dirty and in need of refurbish some staff good but some need to brush up on people skills breakfast was good but the dinner I attended could have been better view from room was brilliant the drive up to hotel is spectacular     
-4;" Shabby. Got the room on the lower ground floor, under reception and next to the basement &quot;bistro&quot;. Treated to night manager stomping about over my head all night, and it sounded like the kitchen staff were in the room with me from about 4am - I could hear every fart, cough and shuffle. AC, fridges, traffic ... Never again. "
-4; I booked a cancellable room for 22nd January 2016. Unfortunately I had to cancel on the morning of the 22nd owing to illness, which I did (and I cancelled breakfast at the same time).  However, because it was after the cancellation cut-off time of the day before, the hotel management is completely and utterly inflexible about making a refund. They insisted that I must produce a doctor's note, which I consider to be nothing more than a convenient way of avoiding making a refund.  Not only that, they are charging me for a breakfast that I never had - how reasonable is that? So please just be careful.  Personally, not only will I never stay here, I will never book into any ANDRIAS London Hotel - the policy comes from ANDRIAS I believe, and their managers appear to have no discretion - or if they do then they don't exercise it. It is now 5th March and I am still liaising with my credit card company to insist on a full refund. It is a shame as this started out with a simple desire to enjoy a nice night in London! 
-4; Absolutely atrocious in every way. Poor service, terrible food, room the size of a cupboard, hotel and spa are both in need of a good clean. They did offer us a free return trip as we were asked to move rooms mid stay but we would never return. Terrible in every way 
-4; I stayed at the royal bath hotel for a conference, and i must say that you can be easily pleased or very badly disappointed by some staff attitude. Reception staff are clueless and too busy chatting with each other about their private life, or even being on their mobile which is disrespectful and unprofessional. When i asked to talk to the manager, the same girl was on, she said that she was the manager, so i do not think there is any point talking to her when she was the one on her mobile phone. Better off writing to Head Office.  The leisure club lady was good and very polite, i believe she said her name was Kirsty. The restaurant staff running off their feet but badly managed who seemed to do nothing, just willing to be there to get paid without making any effort to please or just help the guests. Bar staff are rude and do not know what you are ordering, except one or two. At the end well disappointed!!!!! 
-4; We stayed for the night this week for a whopping £269 and whilst clean and tiny... I mean tidy the room was ridiculously small! Also despite paying a small fortune we didn't even get breakfast! Good location when you finally find it but not worth the money! 
-4; I was booked into this hotel for business as a last minute stop over. Having arrived at the hotel at 1830 to then find the booking had been mixed up. Approximately 30 mins later and several calls they found the booking. I was placed in what could only be described as a cupboard in the attic. Fourth floor has no lift and having climbed the stairs to find the corridors lined in plastic sheeting and rooms being built. Side stepping over tools and power cords. The room was so small you could practically sit in one space and reach everything. The shower struggled to work and water leaked everywhere. To finish it off the bedding had some dubious stains. Having lasted a little over an hour i demanded to be moved to another hotel. I think i would rather have slept in the car than go back to this hotel. 
-4; I have stayed here regularly on business due to the hotel's central location. After over 100 visits to the hotel over 3 years, I turned up this week and was told they had overbooked and given my room to some student. I was told to go to an inferior hotel in torrential rain, getting soaked in the process and having to pay for services like wi-fi, which were included in my room rate at the Radisson.  I endured this hotel despite ignorant staff, dirty rooms and other minor issues, but when they treat guests in this manner, there is no excuse. I will avoid from now on.  Do they care? Of course not! 
-4; What to say about The Copthorne?????? Awful....  Stayed for 1 night thankfully and upon arrival, upgraded our room to a superior room with private balcony. From the reception foyer, the deal seemed very good and we felt that the short time we spent in the hotel would be relaxing and comfortable, how wrong we were. Upon entering our room, we realised how old and dated the hotel was. The furniture had staines and marks over the wood, the chair was thread bare, the balcony covered in bird mess. We felt, being here only one night, that we would not say anything but pop out for some food before returning, to get changed and meet with friends. Upon returning to get ready, I made a mistake of using the iron provided on a new white shirt. Silly me, should have checked the iron as it was covered in goodness knows what and hey presto, shirt ruined. I went to reception to raise a concern and although the reception staff were friendly, I was referred to the duty manager who did not seem to interested in my concern. When I mentioned the state of the room, I was told a refurbishment was happening this year (interestingly, looking On Trip Advisor, this has been said since 2011). Needless to say, I got the upgrade refund however, this no where near covered my concern, or damaged property. We also got a drinks voucher (red wine was awful). One good thing was the shower was great. Next morning, we went for breakfast which was bland and tasteless. Safe to say, would never go back. Sorry Millenium, but you need to spend some money on this hotel and how it's retained 4 stars, I will never know. 
-4; I may well be doing this hotel a disservice but we called in today for a coffee and a cake or similar only to be asked whether we were residents or not? On answering in the negative we were told that they were only serving residents today and were politely asked to leave. My parents used to take us to this hotel when we were young and I was interested to see what it was like now with a view to a future stay (we are currently staying down the road) but I'm afraid that whoever came up with the residents only policy has put off two potential customers. 
-4; Went for a one night stay, it's very difficult to get away what with having 3 young children but we managed it.  Arrived at about 6:30, check in was fine but then got to the room and we both wanted a shower after being at work all day. My wife came out of the bathroom and said that it wasn't very good. I went in and it was pathetic you couldn't get washed properly. I didn't want to complain as we just wanted to get out for a meal and a few drinks.  Tried the shower in the morning again and it was exactly the same. We checked out and I complained to be told that it might be because everyone was in at the same time. What a load of rubbish.  They didn't charge us for parking (£18) but as this room was supposed to cost £275 a night (we paid £174) we were disgusted.  I've complained to the Hilton group directly but haven't heard anything back the customer service on the website is also rubbish. First and last time I'll be staying there. 
-4; Checked in process was fine, though took some doing to find my room wandering along corridors, taking the third lift, up and down stairs. Key worked fine in the lock, which rather surprised the poor lady who was in the room already.   Eventually found me another room. Warm summer day, sash windows fixed shut with paint and no other form of ventilation.  Previous guest's soap left in the shower........  For £40 or £50 a night this would perhaps be OK. But at £139 it was definitely not OK. Especially given the surcharge of £2 for credit card payment, or £0.50 for debit card payment. And you can't pay by cheque even if you still carry a cheque book.  About the worst hotel I have stayed in since an unfortunate visit to Athens in 1993! 
-4; Stayed in standard self catering. First room had cigarette burns all over carpet with filthy, dated kitchen. Entrance and room stunk of damp musk / stale smoke. Went to 'Discover Butlins' office to complain and after being kept waiting was offered the choice of paying for an upgrade of moving. I was sent on a hike to look at another room by their customer care team. When I returned (the room was just as bad) she had left for the day, leaving me to explain all over again. We were offered a third room, still standard which was also very poor. No one cared...I expect the poor staff have even worse rooms to live in. The retail food offer is a joke and is very over price. Cheaper to pay bar prices in some quality 4 star establishment. Saturdays nights comic in Reds was not suitable for a family, and the act struggled to raise a smile from ouir party of 20. Following this 'break' we stayed in £29 Premier Inn room. Brand new and clean. Butlins need to understand this 2012 and other budget accommodation can be great as standard. 
-4; The room had no window, was too hot and was very stuffy. The bathroom extractor fan did not work. The toilet roll holder was broken. There was no hand soap or shampoo in the dispensers.  The breakfast was truly diabolical. The hash browns and bacon were dry, luke warm and cardboard like. The sausages only tasted of bed dried herbs. The mushrooms were annihilated. The scrambled egg was an indescribable substance. The cooked tomatoes were raw. The fruit was tasteless.  The yoghurt and coffee were pretty good though. 
-4;" We booked a 6-day break but conceded defeat after 5 and left.   Yes, it's family friendly. Hoards of kids running wild, totally out of parental control. Knock, knock on your door at 11pm and run away. Oh, what fun. Stomping about upstairs at all hours when there is no soundproofing of the wafer-thin walls or floors. Let's not forget the little golden-haired angel who just loved letting rip with the most ear-splitting scream I've ever heard.  We were given a disabled room (neither of us are disabled) which, apart from a change of towels, was rarely serviced. There was mildew throughout the wet-room. Take a wash/shave in the tiny basin and, if you're over 5' 6&quot;, you risk cutting your head on the glass shelf dangerously positioned overhead. We bought a pasty from Croyde village to be consumed in our room. We were careful and cleaned up most of the crumbs but a few tiny bits remained on the carpet. They were still on the carpet when we left five days later!   We requested a change of room but this was refused.  I feel sorry for anyone who found the food remotely appealing. The scrambled eggs would be put to better use as Polyfiller and the cold, hard-fried eggs in their oily dressing turned my stomach. Tea/coffee making facilities were supposed to be provided but for some reason the milk was rarely replenished. We tried on 3 occasions to get milk from reception but it was closed and unmanned each time we tried. Finally, a kind hearted barman came to our rescue with a cup of milk.  If the food was dire the same could not be said of the waiters and waitresses. They were all efficient, pleasant and very professional. Thank you all.  We decided to leave a day early but before reaching this decision, we asked to make a complaint to the duty manager who made it clear that she was not interested in addressing any complaint. For example, we mentioned the mildew and she asked us what would we do about it. We said we would clean it. What with? she asked. How about Bleach? Can't use bleach. It's against Health & Safety!   That was the final straw and we said we were leaving. &quot;Have a nice journey home.&quot; she said.   Would I recommend this place to my friends? Only if I secretly hated them! "
-4;I arrived at the hotel with my partner late at night to be greated by a lovely reception area unfortunately the attitude of the male staff member behind the desk didn't match the surroundings. There is obvious remodelling work taking place and found my room and breakfast to be below par with constant noise from the floor below which sounded like some other guests having a party. I live in the city and this was meant to be a night of dinner and relaxation but it was far from it.
-4; We booked a deluxe sea view room and were directed to room 24 which was an unpleasant shock. It is in a truly horrible state of decoration, poor condition of furniture with a dirty balcony desperately needing repair.  We returned to reception immediately and were told that this was indeed a deluxe room and no other rooms were available. We needed to persist to be allocated elsewhere, made possible by the receptionist moving someone who still had to check in (sorry to them). The new room was OK but still had gaffer tape holding the vanity unit together and stale musty wardrobes which my wife refused to put her clothes in.   I then looked at TripAdvisor and was shocked to note that a review posted by BaddyPurt two weeks previously had mentioned the problem with room 24. The photos with that review are accurate and represent the room exactly as we found it. No action had been taken on that feedback.  We emailed the general manager there and then. No reply. I asked reception if the general manager was in and was informed she was busy with the budgets. We filled in the email feedback sent by the group asking for a response. Again no reply.  The general manager clearly reads and responds to some of these reviews but genuine feedback is not being taken on board and in our case ignored. The overall impression is of a company milking a progressivey decaying building. Beware of the marketing special deals, the sea view is fabulous but that is the only positive nowadays. 
-4; I am staying here at the moment. That's the week of 26 Nov 2012. Network Rail are jackhammering and rivetting all night and the noise is indecribable.  When I asked to move the night manager said no. We are staying here in two connecting rooms while my daughter recovers from surgery at the Lister Hospital across the bridge. She is fine but needs Mum, rest and room service! When I asked for some recompense at the front desk this morning, the sweet girl on the front dest, trying to be helpful, gave me a police incident number and told me to take up matters of compensation with the Metropolitan Police. Apparently it's been going on all week. Management have been absolutely no help whatsoever, shockingly indifferent. Nightmare. Avoid. 
-4; I foolishly stayed here the night before my wedding (which was held elsewhere) thinking that it would be a relaxed night in a country setting etc etc etc which is what the publicity blurb would have you believe (a 'country retreat' no less according to the website!).  However, it is clear that this place is a wedding/party factory and the sight that greeted me when I arrived was one of coachloads (literally!) of drunken revellers staggering about in various states of inebriation with a thumping disco that is clearly audible across the whole grounds, including in the rooms! To add to the fun it is impossible to get away from the music or the drunken idiots who parade up and down the corridors until the small hours - reminiscent of staying in a University hall of residence on a Friday night during freshers week!   The rooms are OK, but cleanliness isnt great (pubic hairs on the bathroom floor for example and dried mud on the carpet) and neither is maintenance - the window was not secure (the catch was broken) despite being on the ground floor and when I tried to use the safe it clearly wasnt working - after a call to the woefully inadequate reception (way too small for the number of guests) I was told that none of the safes were working - would it not make sense to inform guests of these things beforehand so that they dont have to mess around trying to figure out why they cant operate the safe?!!   All in all the worst possible way I could have spent the night before my wedding and I won't be back!! 
-4; Website looks good - we were looking forward to staying here. Our disaster started with not being able to find it. Sat Nav gave up with finding 'high street' so we called the hotel for directions. Reception seemingly had not received a call for directions before because they weren't able to help. They infact sent us round another lap of Cantebury whereas the car park they were directing us to was just 50 yeards from where we were. To their credit, somebody came and met us at the car park to guide us to the hotel. Why didn't they have a map and talk us through the directions? Checked in - £155 for room only is alot for the room we got. V small and a little tierd, breakfast not included. No hot water in the bathroom in the evening or in fact in the morning - so no showers for us. Phoned reception, they knew that room had an issue yet we were still given it to stay in. Went to fill out a comment card, they didn't have any. Raised these issues to the duty Ops manager who took £56 off our bill and also took off some tee's and coffee's we'd had in the bar area. So, for net £99, I would strongly reccommend you stay somewhere else.  Do you want to stay in a hotel that allocates rooms where they know there is an issue with the hot water? I didn't.  The service is also v slow. We waited 25 minutes for 2 coffee's to arrive - when they arrived one of them wasn't what we asked for - by the time we left - we had had enough.   Really dissapointing. Pretty basic stuff. 
-4; Please do not go there. It is awful. Super bad customer service, rooms and whole hotel are outdated and in serious need of repairs. Bathroom absolutely filthy as well as headboard on bed. Was moved to another room, didn't get much better. Bear in mind these were best sea view rooms hotel had to offer. Food is no good, and if you try and return your dish, they will make you pay for everything and embarrass you in front of everyone. Views are not bad, however there isn't actually anywhere to walk or beach you can go to, hotel is situated on a working harbour and if you want to enjoy the beaches of Cornwall you'll have to get in the car and or ferry to get anywhere.. Real expensive too! Just stay away. Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. 
-4; This place is like a post apocalyptic wasteland where only chavs survived.  This was our first and last trip to a Butlin's site.  We stayed in a Gold apartment which had a blocked shower tray, burnt out hairdryer, broken fridge (that was never fixed) broken TV on the bedroom and dust everywhere which if like me you have a dust allergy is quite a big deal I've included a photo of the filthy shower mat too. The beds are incredibly uncomfortable, don't expect a hotel bed think Argos basic metal frame with cheap mattress, very very creaky. The twin beds only have camp bed mattresses leaving a big gap around the frame. Not suitable for anyone over 5 and even then it's very easy for them to fall onto the frame and hurt themselves.  To be fair the staff in the restaurants and shops are very friendly if a little too laid back at times but the guest services/housekeeping/maintenance staff are appalling.  The entertainment venues are like ovens so bring a handheld fan. As for the entertainment, it was great for very young children but nothing for 6 years plus, it just seem to jump straight to cover bands 60's/70's music.  It takes about 6/7 minutes to walk from the Gold apartments to the pavilion and about 10/12 to the beach.  I'd strongly advise you avoid the beach due to the amount of small black bugs, you quite literally get covered head to toe in them and it never stops. They don't bite, they just sit on your skin but it's not pleasant.  If you've never been to Butlin's then your first visit will be a learning experience because there's nobody around to help or advise you on anything so you spend half the time queuing at reception or speaking to the miserable Gavin at Guest Services (If they answer the phone).  Overall I wouldn't recommend Butlin's because if you can't sleep, shower or keep drinks cold in your accommodation it doesn't really matter what the rest of the site is like. 
-4; My wife took me to forest pines for my birthday and what a terrible experience .If i hadn,t had a drink we would have gone home. No tables in restaurant for a meal , then told they could fit us in , waited an hour before getting sat down , sat at table for half an hour without anyone seeing to us ,so we went to our cold room .Breakfast delivered in morning ( awful ) . Went swimming ,pool cold . Made a complaint . 
-4; On arrival upgraded to an executive level which turned out to be a wheeze. The furniture in the room was dirty anf thread bare hardly an executive room. But they charged £100 extra for it. The heating system did not work and the hotel staff could not fix it. 2 hours in a room where the temperatre was below -0., staff had no idea what they were doing it. Final send off was the lamp that sent an electric shock down my arm. Overall a lossy hotel aith a manangement team that needs replacing. Cold, dirty and dangerous. Only positive piont is the location. 
-4; Just spent 1 night at the Cavendish Hotel,put in a room next to the lift most of the night very noisy but as we were staying for 1 night we put up with it,worst of all I slipped when getting out of the bath and hurt myself badly spent most of my time in St Thomas Hospital which by the way were outstanding,reported incident to hotel who took details then shipped me to hospital.We thought i might have to stay in overnight the hotel said to my husband we can do you a deal of £60 for a basic room no breakfast seemed they just wanted to get rid of the problem,i think they is a safety issue for people of mature age the bath slip mat is to small and the handle getting in/out the bath which is on the back wall should in my opinion be fitted on the side wall at rear of bath we have been here before, but if anything serious happens you need help we would not recommend this hotel because of this it has its good points but we will not be going back we are also considering getting legal help. 
-4; Awful service, having booked well in advance and taking the time to call twice on the day of arrival you would expect a room to be ready, but no… turned up to a ‘Hilton’ at 01:30 in the morning no room ready, had to wait for over 20 mins, totally unacceptable. Staff on reception were rude, room felt dirty, and fresh towels just left on the floor! Just unbelievable and very disappointing... Booking elsewhere next time… 
-4;" First off I would like to state that I am 22 years of age and my girlfriend is 20. The fact that we are younger they immediately tried to take advantage of us. Send us to the worst room, treat us with no respect at all. If we have an inquiry it either does not get answers or they just avoid the issue completely. The pillows are covered in stains, the kitchen is horrible. All of there appliances were either faulty, broken. We were moved to a new room after about 3 days of them telling us they would the first day we complained. The fridge was broken and all of our food went bad. They did not reimburse us for any of it (about £30). what they did when we asked for a couple nights compensation, was say &quot;no, u can have one night in the penthouse though&quot; which no one stays in to begin with. Top floor was completely empty. I would advise anyone reading this to choose another option because I have never been treated this badly before. Please let everyone you know about this, and make sure nothing like this happens to you. Again, worst service, horrible people, disgusting living conditions. - sincerely, a very.. Very unhappy guest. "
-4; This place is a cheap rip of the staff are ignorant and arrogant the rooms are dirty and need a refurb on arrival the receptionist (Daniella) was slouched over the chair and gave a scowl as if we had no right to be there (sabastien) the youthful manager was not much help to us either on entering the room an elderly college trip and fell over the carpet due to what was obviously a hole made in the carpet by a hot iron the showers where cold the breakfast was cold the heating was not working all in all a bad choice made by us please don't make the same mistake avoid at all costs 
-4;" I sent this letter below to the Managing Director. After lots of emails I was offered a discounted room which worked to be more than my first visit without dinner! I expected better service from the MD. I'm sure as previous constructive reviews they will say different. May even state the price I paid & what do I expect. The cost has nothing to do with the service.   To Managing Director,  I hope you can help with an acceptable level of customer service. I have tried to address this without contacting you. We discussed this with your General manager yesterday as we checked out but unfortunately the customer service was not acceptable. The complaint was not dealt with & the offer of a discount was not acceptable customer service. I am sure that you would like this brought to your attention that I why I called. As requested I am now taking the time to put his in writing.  The complaints are as follows; we booked a table at 8pm & arrived on time. After placing our order within 5 minutes the starter didn’t arrive till 8.55. To make matters worse a couple 2 tables down from us came in after us & received their starters before us. One of the dishes they ordered was the same as we had ordered. I discussed this with restaurant manager at the time. It was very frustrating as am a semi pro athlete & eating to late causes problems training early morning & of course recovery from the days training. It took another 30 minutes for the main course. I ordered pork which wasn’t to an acceptable standard & had to be replaced. Another party of six also sent their pork back. This was again brought to the restaurant mangers attention. I like to take my time & enjoy the astrosphere & food but we didn’t finish our desert till 10.35 that’s without relaxing afterwards or enjoy the astrosphere.   I needed a good nights sleep due to training commitments. In the middle of the night we where awoken by the screaming fire alarm. We quickly made our way to reception. It was only when a guest said it’s a false alarm we returned to our room. Still concerned for our safety We still didn’t feel safe as the all clear hadn’t been given by your staff or any communication from them at all. Then it went off again! I didn’t go back to sleep by that time it was getting light. Still no communication or apologies not even the next morning. Your staff stated when I asked it was a guest smoking. General manager said it was faulty equipment?   I do not believe we had an expectable level of service.   Please can you contact me to resolve this situation & restore my faith in your customer service & hotel?   Look forward to your response  Regards Mark Darcy "
-4; How can you run a hotel where some of the rooms are seriously damaged by loud music? I'm currently staying at this hotel on business and the music from the bar in the basement is constantly blaring out. I could understand if it was a very faint background noise, but this is extremely annoying. How can the council allow the bar to have a licence knowing it would disturb the sleep of guests at the hotel?  Rest of the hotel is OK, but seems dated. Room is small but the bathroom is nice. The cooked side of the breakfast is a bit mean for the price. One sausage, bacon and egg is not worth £17.50   I will never stay at this hotel ever again. The positive reviews on this hotel were either written by people who stayed on nights when the bar was closed or lucky enough to be on rooms not disturbed by the noise. I would not leave it to chance that you don't get a room that will keep you awake all night and avoid this hotel all together. 
-4; I, like, many others have been scammed by this hotel, I was called on the day of my check-in to be told that a 'boiler problem' meant I had to be moved to another hotel. I write this review from that very hotel, I have been given a tiny room with a tiny window, the window is mostly useless since outside the window are two huge air conditioning pipes making an horrendous racket, between the two pipes the view is of another guest's window 4 feet away. When I checked in there was a gentleman in reception already complaining about his room and trying to be moved.  Don't stay at the Shaftesbury Metropolis London Hyde Park, it prossibly doesn't even exit! 
-4; After experiencing the most shambolic experience on Christmas Day we sent a letter to the General Manager asking for an explanation of how the day could be so poor in all aspects. The reply we received was a total insult to our intelligence. After ruining our family Christmas Day the General Manager only offered pathetic excuses blaming the staff for not turning up leaving them short on the day. He then offered a free Sunday lunch as some sort of compensation for our experience. This pretty much sums up the mentality and customer care the Hotel offer. Needless to say we will never go back there and would urge anyone considering a special day at this Hotel to think again. 
-4; not a great place, front of house manger needs to be replaced , food ok , but is bad attitude of mangement . will not be going back, oh yes the cleaning????? badddd. overall 1 out of10, very poor. dont pay £105 for the patio, is not good 
-4;We booked in March, when the reviews appeared to be OK, then just before we went down to London we checked Tripadvisor for the address. It now appears that it is company policy to send various guests to sister hotels on excuses such as plumbing problems, computer problems or over booking problems.  We arrived at reception at 14.15, or rather at the back of a long que, mostly caused by guests being told of over booking or plumming problems (see other people's reviews on this site and Booking.Com) This hotel group must have the worst plumbing in London .  We were lucky and got our room, a club class room, however their were 2 couples, and a single lady fobbed off with a hotel 'just around the corner' The couple objected as it was a long walk with large cases. The hotel eventually got them a taxi.  The reception was disorganised, unfriendly and uninformative. We were not asked if we wanted a morning paper, early morning phone call, nor told where and what time breakfast was.  We got to the room, the door needed a lot of pressure to open it, however you were not warned that there was a 5 inch drop as you walked in the door. You could not see the drop as the lights would not come on until you placed your key card in the slot. I went flying. (please see photos)  Once in the room, we noticed that the main double doors to the balcony were sealed shut. Well actually they were held shut with a peice of wood, half screwed in with just one screw. The top of the door had a one inch gap, which coupled with the two inch gap in the room door caused a draft. The wood failed in the night and we had to wedge the door shut. The wall on the balcony is very low, and this is a safety issue. We informed reception, who really were not bothered about the implications. The room also did not have any information about fire exits or muster points. You could not lock the door from the inside so any member of staff could of come in when ever it suited them. (Room 504)  Bearing in mind that this room was a spacious Club Room, the desk and chair are for decoration only, as it is impossible to actually sit at the desk unless you are two years old. No writing pad, pen etc, nor trouser press. This is a four star hotel???????  To say the bathroom was small is being over generous. The best way to clean your teeth is to sit on the toilet.  There was no where to sit to watch television unless you sat on the bed. The hotel is situated across the road from a noisy hostel, and as the windows are in such a poor state of repair, you did not get a good nights sleep. To add insult to injury, the fire alarm went off for about a minute at 2.30 waking everyone up, then just stopped.  Avoid this hotel and group.   Mr Gupta, (hotel manager), please don't bother replying to this with the usual crass answers. The hotel group treats its customers with contempt.
-4; We went as a family of five, two interconnecting rooms. Good rooms, reasonable breakfast. WE stayed just for 10 hours, over night. WE have been charged £24 as car park fee for 9-10 hours over night stay! 
-4;" My partner booked this hotel for a two day getaway for my birthday as a surprise after a long, stressful week of business.Everything looked to be in order at the beginning. The hotel lobby and bar looked decent and we checked in quick sometime after 2pm to room 38. I immediately noticed there were signs posted on every floor apologising the appearance of the hotel as the are undergoing some sort of renovation. So we looked past the dirty laundry and cutlery all over the hallway leading up to our room. What we didn't expect, was our room door to be tested with 25 different shades of white paint (not exaggerating) which wasn't a good first impression. Upon entering our standard room (we had just wanted a bed away for the night but clearly we later came to regret this, maybe I should have ordered a suite to be taken more seriously, but I doubt that would've been better anyway) everything looked decent while looking at the big picture. We watched Tv for a while and then proceeded to get ready for our restaurant reservation at 9pm. This is when we started running into problems. After I had used the bath I went to use one of the hotel towels, as I unraveled one of them I noticed brown, unsanitary marks on the edges of the towel, dreading to think what they once were, I used this to clean up the water that had seemingly leaked from the back of the bath all the way up to the sink and used a less stained towel to clean myself. We then proceeded to iron our clothes but of course there was no iron inside the room, we tried to use the trouser press but it wasn't sufficient enough for our clothes. The last straw of this room was when we went to lay inside the bedsheets to try to relax before we had to leave the hotel, as I lifted the sheets and moved them, I noticed a small rubber dot towards the bottom, taking a closer look it seemed to be the broken tip of a CONDOM, not something you'd like to see in your hotel bed or anywhere for that matter. At this point I had enough and went down to reception. I was greeted by an asian man whose name i didn't grab. I told him of all the problems and he looked bedazzled as well as angry. He offered there maids to do another sweep off the room while we were away. The way he said this to me was as if I was supposed to be impressed by this... I calmly accepted this, even though this was in no way acceptable recompense for the problems we faced in the first room. I requested an iron as our reservation was in about 45 minutes and he said a maid will bring it up pronto. So I made my way back to the room, disheartened by the service but wiling to give the hotel another chance. We waited another 15 minutes for the iron that never came, so again I had to go back down and request it, by this time we had 30 minutes to go. I requested if we could just have another room and he told me that &quot;believe it or not, we're completely jam packed sir&quot;. After him seeing the look on my face (and possibly, from the vibe I was getting, judging us because I was a young business man in a standard room) he then said he'd meet me in my room with a new room key. So indeed, he did lie to my face. He moved us to an identical room two doors down, where the presentation of the door was lacking again, and then we ran into similar, if not worse problems in this room. After missing out on our reservation due to the hotel's problems, we settled for imperial lounge next door where we had a completely unsatisfactory meal, running our night. We then came back to stay in room 36. I'll scan through the problems we ran into in this room just to save some time. Again, stains on the towels, with some black marks. Severe dust under the bedside table we moved to lay our food on. Kettle was rusted shut. Headboard for the bed was broken and moved with every shuffle, dust and unclean section at the floor of the windows and no plughole for a bath. We checked out a day early on Sunday 29/05/16 at 4:20pm, the lady who was on the desk asked if I was supposed to be checking out on Monday, I said yes but the rooms are terrible so we're leaving now. She nodded and said that's fine and it's all been payed for so we can leave. No asking of the reasoning, no consoling. I quickly left, infuriated before I lost my temper in front of the many families and children in the lobby. I rang and contacted a manager who said they would get back to me in 2-3 days after checking the rooms for problems but I replied that some of the problems had been cleared away so this isn't going to cut it. I then grabbed the email of the hotel and gave them this story, including all photographic evidence. I received an email back from the general manager --- ---. After giving it the usual &quot;we make mistakes and try to learn from them&quot; and the &quot;sincerely apologise&quot; I wanted to get to the part where they were going to make it right. Considering I have been to hundreds of hotels which have offered me amazing stays for lesser problems, I thought they must be coming up with something really good if they don't want this to get out there. He even said he has no excuses for any of the problems and I quote &quot;To be completely honest and forthright I have no excuse or can offer no extenuating circumstances for many of your points, it was not correct and I apologise&quot;. So he himself knows they completely ruined a life event with absolutely no excuse as to why. He then offered me a full refund OR a one night stay at the hotel chain... I couldn't believe my eyes. After leaving the hotel with my partner in tears, checking out early, facing all the avoidable, extraordinary problems that we faced, we had a choice between a refund or another one night stay. Absolutely disgusting. After telling him this, and explaining I'm amazed he isn't offering both I asked for a full refund. He then replied with another offer stating eh would extend the offer so we could have another stay. First, just let me say that as a manager myself, I fully understand the concept of principal (something which the general manager of this hotel does not). If someone leaves your establishment offended, not even to the extent that me and my partner felt, you offer them something which compels them to return. Regarding our stay, If I was in your position Mr Manager, I would certainly from the start offer something that would 'wow' my guest to come back, considering the traumatic experience they had. I enquired about the room standard and he replied he'd be able to put me in na deluxe room subject to availability. We didn't feel this is acceptable, as firstly, we have to barter with this manager to gain acceptable compensation?? And secondly, after some research the room standard is not acceptable compensation at this particular hotel, as it is not much better than the other sets of rooms we stayed in. I then replied with the concept of principal, stating that we should be in an executive room at the LEAST, with some type of activity such as dinner. To which he replied he cannot offer more than what was payed for? After reading the reviews I can see the hypocritical nature of this man, as he's offering free wine and dinner left, right and centre. Exclaiming to him that we would not be willing to return, he then offers the same standard room &quot;(with dinner)&quot;. If trip advisor allowed more strong words I would be using them right now.. What you have to understand, is that when someone leaves your business to be offended (and rightly) to such a degree, you try everything you can to bring them back and you do not offer them the bare minimum hoping that they will take it each time. We were offered no fair compensation at all, when you ruin an event in someones life, its not enough to offer a one standard up room and then barter with them &quot;with dinner&quot;. Again, I have never been so offended to such a degree in my experience with any business. I have never felt the need to spread the word on a hotels downfall, however I will be with this one. Do not come to this hotel, the reviews speak for themselves. I will be forwarding this information to all my business associates, friends and family. Its sad that this matter could have been avoided if the staff just did their job's correctly. "
-4;"I've been visiting this hotel every year for the last few years and this time I was extremely dissatisfied. Normally as a gold member I get an upgrade to a better room which was terrible: no complimentary mineral water (have to ask) no slippers in a room (have to ask) the safe was braking (had to call engineer) and when I went up to the executive floor to get a drink I was literally told &quot; you can't come in as there are other people who actually pay for it &quot;  Well I was speechless!   Every year I stay at different Hilton Hotels worldwide and this stay at Hilon Gatwick South was simply the worst!"
-4; We booked a two-night stay through Travelzoo expecting over two-hundred acres of parkland and a 4* hotel. The room we were given was large, with no windows or views and only two borrowed lights in the roof.. The bathroom contained a spa bath - which didn't work.  We chose to use the spa facilities and went for a swim. Unfortunately, the pool, modest in size by any standards, was so shallow you grazed your toes. The jacuzzi-style pool had so little water in it that, even with four adults in it the jets wouldn't work. Dinner in the restaurant was preceded by a twenty-minute wait to be seated, and the over-stretched staff couldn't cope with the numbers. The food was lukewarm and the beef stringy and tough. Service was haphazard, due, it seemed to me, to the number of covers they were trying to serve. After another long wait to be seated for breakfast the next morning we ordered, at extra cost, two specialities from the menu - one of which was, after a ten-minute wait, reported to be unavailable. We asked to see he manager and, after verifying his status, brought our concerns to him. He was very attentive, offered us another room which we declined as we were only staying one more night and didn't want the hassle of moving. We, also, attempted to go for a walk in the extensive grounds but were quickly confronted with a sign barring our way. The grounds are a golf course and NOT a safe place to walk. On our second night we chose to eat elsewhere and found an excellent local pub. The hotel 'manager' offered to obtain and pay for taxis when her heard of our intention, but as we didn't know, at the time, where we intended to go, we declined the offer. Breakfast on day two was the same fiasco of waiting to be seated - ten minutes for us, twenty-five minutes reported by the couple already waiting at the bottom of the stairs as we entered the restaurant. Checking out offered the final insult: The manager informed us that we had not paid for the second night of our visit. We showed him the Travelzoo confirmations, but couldn't get an internet signal to check our bank balance. He insisted, in front of other guests, that we had NOT paid and requested authority to take a further payment, which we declined as we could not verify his statement. He, then, explained that it was the hotel's responsibility to take the payment from the details provided by Travelzoo, and that the hotel had failed to do this. We were so wary by this time that we agreed that we would give permission for a second payment only after we had reached home and confirmed what had happened via our credit card company. I also insisted that, given the poor quality of the service he should be considering a refund rather than an additional payment. He pointed out that he had taken the sundries off our bill - £8 for the speciality breakfasts and a beer and a soft drink in the bar. On returning home we detailed our complaints to customer relations who passed them on to the REAL manager. His reply was, in my opinion, dismissive and avoided accepting any of our complaints. He offered us a one night stay with breakfast by way of compensation. We certainly haven't any intention of expending time, effort, or cost in returning to this hotel ever again. To cap it all, the hotel took a further payment for the second night without authorisation and, as we subsequently found out, Travelzoo charge a premium over the hotel's exactly comparable offer. 
-4; Let's start with the room. Freezing cold, radiator size far too small, chipped and dangerous tiles in bathroom, ditto mirror in bathroom. The very inefficient and useless reception staff offered early morning call, why? Waste of use of vocal cords because it didn't happen. But that all pails into minor frustrations compared with the complete idiots on the food side. A chef who can't read his own menu. Wine menus that have differing descriptions and numbering depending on who gets it. Total pot luck what wine is served if ordered by number. Food very small portions not enough for a mouse and totally different from description on menu. Advice avoid at all costs this place is complete joke. I could go on and write a book about its other failures but the biggest issue is clearly a total lack of staff training and failure to recruit properly. PS forget the wifi that's just a lie. 
-4; Stayed here with a friend before a flight during August. Place was pretty busy and the room, like something out of the 1970s was filthy - it had been cleaned but looked like the staff must have been in a severe rush. Was noisy at around 4.30am with guests seemingly banging around leaving for early flights.  Read through the Tripadvisor score before he booked it, which at 3.5 didn't seem bad.   On arrival, I later noticed many of the 5-star reviews had been written by 'one review TripAdvisor accounts' who mysteriously never reviewed anything else. One was a 'two review account' and had suspiciously only reviewed two places... both owned by Hallmark - this one, and their hotel restaurant in Wilmslow ten miles away. That's either a long walk to breakfast or this hotel has a teleporter like that film The Fly.  Some in this industry need to stop being greedy and dedicate their time and money to hotel standards instead of writing not very 'independent' reviews on TripAdvisor. 
-4; The car park attendant was rude and sarcastic to me when I arrived. The lunch menu was tatty and the food was underwhelming. Breakfast was busy, cramped, tasteless and uninspiring. The room was freezing, the views were drab. The hotel is practically in an island surrounded by fast cars, the only way out is via a dodgy underpass. Car parking was extra with the hassle of having to double park and leaving keys at reception all the time. Never again.  Complete waste of money. When I complained about the cold room the reply was cold and glib. Avoid if at all possible - I have stayed in all sorts of hotels over the years - this is one of the worst in terms of value for money and hospitality 
-4;" We have stayed at this hotel many times and found it dated but traditional. We have always found the staff helpful and our stays have been excellent. Unfortunately, however, we arrived on 22nd April, Easter week, just exactly one month from our last visit. We had booked on line and paid for a SEA VIEW DE LUXE ROOM with afternoon tea on the second day for after completing our busines. Check in was perfect and faultless as usual. The room was very good, with a nice sea view. A small problem with the internet was promptly dealt with by the duty manager. All went swimmingly well, as expected. Breakfast fine. After a short walk following breakfast we returned to the hotel to change, to find a scaffold being erected outside our sea view window and bathroom. Having to attend to business, we had to close the curtains and be VERY CIRCUMSPECT in the use of the bathroom. If we can see and hear the workmen - they can see us - and, unfortunately the toilet was next to the window, and had no curtains. On return for a pre-booked afternoon tea, we wondered why people were musing as to the delay. We soon found out. After complaining twice, we received the tea booked for 4.00p.m. at 5.10p.m. minus the cutlery and beveredge. However, a further round of discussion prompted this to arrive. Dear reader, thank you for &quot;sticking with us so far&quot;. Obviously this did not help our appetites for an evening meal, and by the time we were hungry the restaurant had closed - but that's life isn't it? We retired to the room to be gently aroused at 7.50a.m. by the dulcet tones of two scaffolders going about their buiness, as our pictures show, directly outside our window. To be perfectly fair, they must have been as embarassed as we were. Having been awakened by these gentleman we hurriedly washed, dressed and went down to breakfast - remebering they were outside our bathroom window. In the breakfast room we were shown to a table which could only be described as within the &quot;St. Trinian's School Dining Hall&quot;. We declined the kind ladies invitation to breakfast there and returned to our room to pack. We received a telephone call from the restaurant manager to say they had a table for us in a quieter area, but by now our &quot;raison d'etre&quot; was to return home. As mentioned, we had paid the room plus sea view supplement in advance. We checked out and paid the bar bill and extras in full, to be requested to wait and speak to the manager, after we had stated we were dissatisfied. The manager spoke to us at length, showed great concern, expressed profusely that she did not know the scaffold was being erected, which was a puzzle as it went up the front of the reception view. The result of our chat was an offer of one night free accommodation, and that the hotel would point out to future customers the fact that the scaffold is there until September, which they have done. How this helps us, we are at a loss to understand. Her reply by e mail, was that room 117, which we had been allocated, was the most affected room. Our contention was that we should have been informed - and offered a suitable alternative room. A little transparency at the outset would have saved this situation, and we doubt we shall ever return as, sadly, our confidence in Puma Hotels may have diminished. beyond repair. "
-4;stayed this weekend for one night £180 fizz break room not ready also not that clean plus i got charged £9.20 to park my car in the hotel car park when having breakfast lots of dust on shelves  when i had evening meal i had the pie that been heated in a microwave as burnt my mouth as it was so hot  i paid £180 plus £90 spa treatments  PLUS WINDOW WOULD NOT SHUT SO WIND AND RAIN COMING IN NEVER AGAIN
-4; Do you enjoy the sound of a jackhammer?   Then look absolutely no further than Shaftesbury Hyde Park International Hotel. Its sure to satisfy your craving for noisy, sleepless and uncomfortable night. Want to maximise your chances of lying awake all night? Then just ask for a room on level 1. Room 117 to be exact.  My partner and I stayed at this hotel in that room on 18 January 2012. We returned from dinner nearby at about 8:30pm. I heard what sounded like a jackhammer vibrating sound coming from within the ceiling. I thought was maybe a washing machine upstairs hoping along the floor while completing its spin cycle. The noise persisted on and off until at 11pm we contacted reception. They send a staff member upstairs who acknowledged the noise before telling us the hotel was fully booked. Nothing could be done. I almost wept at the thought of a sleepless night.  I managed to shut off reality and get some sleep with some heavy duty ear plugs. My partner wasn’t so lucky and contacted reception during the night to complain yet again. Not wanting to wake me by returning to the room to sample some of the delightful sounds again, the same staff member thought he’d have a listen in vacant room 109 (so much for being fully booked). He again acknowledged the sound.  I am completely mystified as to why a hotel in central London would allow noise of the volume and nature to persist throughout the night despite acknowledging it. We have sent a formal complaint to the manager to ask what was actually making the sound and to request a refund. 
-4; Only minor issues started off our 2 night stay, but after having been awoken twice - first by housekeeping walking in and then by a screaming argument by 2 members of staff our frustrations increased - this basically put the rest into context...some of the food was off - including the milk in the breakfast - the facilities i.e. spa and pool were on the other side of the hotel and really quite unexceptional no robes provided to get there. Despite staying in a ground floor disabled access room there was not sufficient room for a wheelchair - just to let anyone know. If you're considering this place as it is 4 star and therefore has an extended range of facilities I would think again. Bog standard but high price. I would have been happy to discuss this with the management at the time but was ignored. 
-4;out of date, over priced and noisy. food very average. not 4 star quality.£12 for a pizza, that wasn't very good. disappointing for this brand to provide such a very average experience. there was absolutely nothing of the quality you would expect from Hilton. functional maybe.
-4;" Worst hotel I've ever stayed in, and I've stayed in one of those crappy Travel Lodge Hotels by the motorway services.  - Dated and very small rooms (view to a solid brick wall 5 feet from our window) - Smallest bed I've ever seen in a Hotel, not even a double bed - &quot;Free&quot; wifi that doesn't work - Took over 30 minutes to bring up a blanket and wine glass (glasses never arrived) - Wedding guests fist fighting in the street outside the hotel covered in blood (police not even called) - Wedding music blaring all evening and late into the night [currently 23:30 and still going, even getting louder], so loud it sounded as though it was being piped directly into our room (horrible rave music with a fast loud beat) -£20 per night parking charges (ok we are in the centre of Brighton)  It's a beautiful building, in a perfect location - it is such a shame that the whole experience has been ruined by the above issues.  We are very upset that we wasted our time and money on this trip to stay in a tired room, in a tiny bed, with loud rave music blaring through the walls. What a waste of time - Shame on you Hilton. "
-4; Arrived after a long journey to be told that we could not eat in the restaurant until 9.30 - never heard of this before when staying at a hotel - told we had to book!! We went to our room (a garden room as we had a dog) only to find that the tv was not working and there was no Internet! We had not choice but to go to Woodbridge to eat. The staff seemed unable to help or interested in our dissatisfaction. The room was also tired and housekeeping was very poor. On emailing the Manager he could not be bothered to address the email using our name. We shall not be staying here again as there are lots of hotels which offer better service. 
-4;"As a Marriott Platinum Elite member for several years, I can safely say the view this hotel has provided me with in regards to Marriott as a whole is simply appalling. My hotel room was infested, yes infested, with well over 50 flies. On calling reception to ask for a solution (fly spray, alternate room etc.), I was greeted at my room door by a member of reception with a vacuum cleaner and a duster brush -- the lady proceeded to attempt to vacuum up th e live flies, which failed. As a result, I had to climb onto a chair to attempt the same - nothing gained here. So, the next &quot;solution&quot; was to turn off a the room lights, open the room door and wait 15 minutes in the vain hope the flies to the light of the hall. Well, this didnt work either, so the lady went to the hotel kitchen and came back with lemons and cloves to &quot;prevent&quot; more flies entering the room., and she was then gone. Part way through the vacuuming excerise, a man appeared at my room door and simply looked in, and walked away -- it later tranpired this person was the night manager - no introduction from him, no appologies, no assistance. Eventually, I tired to attempting to kill the flies (now more than before as they continued to enter from the window), I decided to check out of the hotel. Reception informed me that as the hotel was full, I could not be transferred to another room, so I said I would leave. As I &quot;chose&quot; to leave, the hotel said I would need to pay the full price of my booking.  I was then asked if I wanted to speak to the night manager, who may be able to assist -- well, this is when I relaised who the man was that appeared at my door an hour ago. So, the night manager again failed to provide his name, or approach me by saying &quot;Hello Mr x&quot; - instead it was &quot;I understand you want to check out sir&quot;.. and I was then advised I needed to pay the full amount again -- I was then asked if I was a Marriott rewards member, so I said &quot;Yes, platinum Elite&quot; -- to which he said &quot;Good, we can offer some free points for your trouble&quot;, and they then proceeded to provide me with a receipt for payment of the room... So, a room with, in the end, over 100 flies, being asked to vacuum then up myself, have the lights off and TV off, the room door open, and then picking up dead flies by the bed, lights, tables, etc., is deemed to be OK to stay in, and when the customer complains, with no other hotel provided options, you charge the full rate (not even 5% off, or a free bottle of wine - nothing), you say its because I chose to check out -- absolutely appaling. And, to top it off, no sign of the free points on my account as yet. Do not stay here! This place is not worhty of the name Marriott, and has no idea how to look after the brands most frequent guests."
-4; Just got back from a birthday spa weekend at the hotel. Front desk staff were helpful and took our bags and booked us a taxi into Chester. The hotel itself is not the most stylish and feels very dated. Dark and gloomy corridors, rooms are very very warm even with the windows open and the water from the taps tastes rancid. Our kettle had to be plugged in on the other side of the room due to a tiny flex. We had seafood for starter and main in the restaurant and all i can say is we left early this morning because my girlfriend is not feeling very well at all. Due to my girlfriends illness I was not able to enjoy the spa so can't comment.   I usually write very optimistic reviews, but this has to be the worst place I have ever stayed. I would not wish anyone to stay here, even with a groupon voucher. 
-4;Would not have believed it had it not been happening to me! A nice valentines treat turned laughable anecdote. Hilton! Yeah right. Left feeling it was a group of cowboys who'd stolen and erected the Hilton logo. Half eaten mini bar, rubbish in the bin - rang down, was told it would be sorted immediately, a 2 night stay and 52 hours later and upon leaving, all still there. Attempted a shower before an evening dinner reservation, shower plug was clamped shut, unable to be opened, rang down, told maintenance would come straight away, 2 further calls and 40 minutes later, and nothing, now late for dinner! Spa and pool, terrible condition, towels and rubbish littered all over the changing room floor. Tried to queue for a drink in a relatively quiet bar area, 15 minutes later, I may as well of been a see through ghost! Tried to order cheese and biscuits later, was told I couldn't order there, and had to go somewhere else, so I went the somewhere else. Yes, you guessed it, then was told I had to order back where I was!! It was at this point I called for the manager!  Then came an open and honest admission that they were really struggling to cope as a hotel over a busy period and simply were not up to standard in every department, I was passed contact details of the general manger, to be continued. Day after, tried to reserve a table at the restaurant over the phone, was told I could not do this over the phone, and had to go down and do it in person. So. Called the lift (1 of only 3 that services 299 rooms) and went to book a table, sure enough, fully booked! How or indeed why human nature and basic common sense would not dictate to inform main reception of this fact is still to this day beyond me! So left the following day, disappointed to say the least.  For the cost, and the less said the better on that truly atrocious. Since been in contact with the manger, with a reply coming many days after the initial email was sent. In true corporate style, eventually I was asked for a contact phone number, then many more days later, I received an apology and a 1 night refund! Unsatisfactory to say the least. Could go on, but to have made the above errors is one thing, but to have then dealt with it in such a lasses faire is a whole new level of incompetence. Shall not be returned in a decade of Sundays. Regards, one very dismayed customer!
-4; Booked room for the weekend of July 13/14 but arrived to find, along with dozens of others, that there was no room. Do not risk booking here. Really unhelpful staff. Significantly out of pocket as a result. I'm sure many other reviews will bear this out. Useless place. Avoid booking or be very disappointed. 
-4; I would like to start with that’s it’s a good job I still have my sense of humour , the Alveston manor is the worst hotel I’ve stayed in for a long time .  1. We arrived at 6.30 could not park in the front car park we had to go to the overflow car no prob it’s a 5 min walk  2. Get to reception the front of house member of staff speaks poor English and wearing a jacket 2 sizes too big 3. Then tells me I have to pay £5.00 to park in the hotel car park over night  4. I have to walk back to the car to put a slip of paper on the dash of my car 5. He wants a swipe of my credit card which is normal but then takes £25.00 , just in case I order any drinks ? 6. I asked if I could book a table for dinner with him , yes you can he says , oh no you can’t the restaurants now open you can go on the way to your room 7. Get to the room and the champagne is not cooled and the glasses were in the ice bucket  8. Go to the restaurant , as the lady who is on the desk for a table she says 9pm is the earliest , I pointed out the restaurant was ¾ empty she say she only has enough staff for this many and 9 pm is the earliest as she said , I asked if any one didn’t show up could she give my room a call as I’m diabetic  9. We ended going in to Stratford for a sandwich and then back to the bar , which when I asked the lady why was the restaurant empty and I can’t get a table until 9 she could not do enough for us  10. We went to the restaurant at 9 for our table and was seated , I noticed all the staff were wearing uniform that were too big for them .. is this a company choice  11. While I was having a £11.25 glass of wine from a £ 5.00 bottle ! we were joined in the restaurant by a little four legged friend  12. Watching 3 waiters in oversized clothes trying to catch a mouse was entertaining but not really what I was expecting in a hotel of this cost and size and no apogee. 13. The duty manager said because it was booked through you they didn’t have all my details or they could of contacted me , which is strange as they had them when I booked in  14. I had to pop in to work for a few hours this morning so had to leave at 6.30 I asked if I could have an early breakfast , I was told it starts at 8 at the weekend I explained the diabetic thing again and was told sorry nothing I can do  15. So I have stopped at a garage for some breakfast on the way to work , but at least It was clean and there was no mice. 16. I tried to sort this with the duty manager on sat 1.11.14 , but she just said sorry , the restaurant manager said the mice issue didn’t happen often !!!!!!!!!!!!!! and I could have had room service … at an extra cost  17 I have also reported them to the local health agency .

-4; I have often recommended clients and suppliers use this hotel. However that may be about the change. I met some clients there recently - they were paying accommodation guests of the hotel plus a group of 5 of us bought drinks there - and not only did I come away with a big drinks bill (which is fair enough) but also received a letter demanding £100 for the privilege of parking to spend my money there!  It was dark when I arrived, so even if there are parking warning signs, I did not see them in the dark and none of the hotel staff mentioned anything. I therefore assumed you would allow me to park there so that I could spend money in your bar, visiting clients who were staying there. I understand that you don't want your car park used by just anyone - in which case introduce a barrier system or something similar which ensures your paying guests do not get nasty demands for money for visiting your hotel.  Extremely disappointed. 
-4; Stayed in this hotel for business. £235 per night and that didn't even include breakfast!  I mentioned it to reception and he was helpful in adding breakfast at not charge BUT he changed my room from a Queen to a Business (sneaky) which was on the 4th Floor, the smokers floor!!!   The whole floor reaked of cigarettes from the smoking rooms! The smell came right under my door and was very sickly, I couldn't sleep as I could taste the smoke in my mouth. Very gross. If you are a smoker you probably won't notice but for non smokers its very unpleasant. The room also looked very tired and dated, needs to be completely decorated! 
-4; We booked this hotel via booking.com , me ,wife and two little ones , first the location was residential and in the middle of no where in terms of shops and resturants , the receptionist gave us the first bad surprise , booking.com have booked for us the wrong room , I clearly chosen the right family number and we were offered a room with one bed ! , at the time it was late at night and we just came back from legoland , so we asked if they can offer any solution , there is no one else but that receptionist by the look of things , she was not keen to help and after awhile she took us to a room with two extra foldable beds , I looked at them and both were unusable and broken , she just shrugged her shoulders and left us some extra sheets and left ! , I slept on the floor and all family on one bed , the next morning at the check out the other receptionist demanded extra money for the kids stay , I was furious, he was rude and abrupt , looks like it's not the first time they have done that , I will never come near this hotel , not four stars by all means 
-4; Booked the hotel on hotel tonight app. When we arrived, the woman said we were too late and they had given the room away, but could get us the room for an extra £30 (doesn't really make sense to me). As it was late, we had no choice. The room itself was very very old, and had a funny smell to it. Overall, very unpleasant stay. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. 
-4; we had a 3 night mid week stay for a conference of approximately 400 people. the staff could not cope with the volume with 1-2 members of staff on the bar trying to serve everyone and not doing a good job of it. the wait could be up to 30 miniutes. the food was pretty bland. there was no air conditioning, or it wasnt switched on. the bedrooms were large and spacious but unfortunately on the second night i was bitten twice with bed bugs and on the third and final night i was bitten about 14-15 times on the head and my brother about 2-3 times. it did not feel like a 4 star hotel at all. i would not recommend this hotel at all 
-4;" The reception is located in a the nice looking building shown in the picture but the rooms are in a horrible, ridiculously oversized extension. See the sat image below - the little building under the pin is the bit in the picture. It's very misleading.  http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=+CV37+7NZ&hl=en&ll=52.131871,-1.601209&spn=0.00192,0.004544&sll=52.133435,-1.599787&sspn=0.001841,0.004544&vpsrc=6&hnear=Stratford-Upon-Avon+CV37+7NZ,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=18  Staff were unfriendly and unprofessional. There's no attention to detail. The rooms were dated and there's no kettle/coffee.   When we got there the key didn't work so I had to walk all the way back to reception (no phones in the corridor) to be told &quot;it does work&quot;. Then instead of offering to come and help, they just gave me another key and said &quot;try that&quot;. For over £100 a night, this isn't how it's done!  Room service didn't come in an hour and then took an additional 30 minutes after a reminder call. We only asked for a toothbrush!  The only redeeming quality was the helpful & friendly waiter at breakfast. I don't know how he's stayed positive when everyone else there is so bloody miserable.  Can't recommend this place for anyone. Much better options available around there. "
-4;Hotel is a decent 3 star really, staff are friendly, food OKish..... I didnt get any sleep at all!! Avoid on Fridays and Saturdays!! No wonder we got a good deal as Saturday is Gypsy wedding day! Shouting, screaming, kids running around and even someone ringing our room telephone several times and hanging up!! Nightmare, will avoid this place like the plague unless of course you have your very own caravan and like to act like animals!! And yes, I did report this to reception, errr... yes sorry, weve had loads of complaints. Bye then. !?!?!?!?
-4;" Following check-in, we were sent to the wrong elevator section with our heavy bags where one of the two elevators was out of service. We had a long wait for the remaining elevator then, on arrival at our floor, we had to walk a full 180 degrees of the circle to find that our room was directly opposite the other elevator section. It was 7.30pm and we were hungry so we tried to call the restaurant to reserve a table. On dialling &quot;0&quot; for the Operator, there was no reply after allowing the phone to ring for 5 minutes (fortunately, we didn't have an emergency!). We gave up and dialled the Reception Desk who put us through to the Brasserie Restaurant who told us that the restaurant was currently full and that they didn't take reservations so we would need to take pot luck. We protested on the basis that we had reserved a table on previous occasions but the person at the other end of the phone insisted that they didn't take reservations. We went for a drink and decided to take pot-luck at the restaurant later in the evening. On arrival we were asked whether we had a reservation! Of course we did not and we explained what had happened earlier but it seemed that we did indeed need a reservation and the restaurant was still full of people (many of whom had made their reservations earlier that evening!). On protesting the situation to the Restaurant Manager he was very obliging in squeezing us in and he even served the meal himself. He had an excellent attitude that was completely in contrast to the remainder of our experience. He even told us that we were entitled to 10% discount on food and beverages due to us having booked a premium room - we were not told this at check-in and had never been told this before when we booked a premium room. As the heading says, this place has gone to the dogs, despite having more competition on it's dooorstep. "
-4; The room was small, badly arranged & the furniture was badly marked, access to the room was delayed by two hours for which the staff thought was ok. We had to que to check in & que to check out because they don't have enough staff! 
-4; I'm afraid this review is a vent of a bad experience which started on check in when a member of our party of 6 was told their room had been cancelled as he failed to show the previous night (the other 5 had been present, and we had explicitly not cancelled the room as it was still required, and we intended to pay for it).   Our stay got worse as I then got food poisoning from the hotel dinner. This would be excusable had it not been for the staff members response the following morning ... Simply 'well what would you like us to do about it sir' .... Erm let me think .... Follow whatever you procedure is, notify the kitchen and apologise... Not after a free meal or discount, just a sorry,mare you ok, can I get you some water would have done.  2 nights later bad to worse ... We returned to the hotel about 10 pm and went to order food .... The kitchen was closed, the chef had gone home ! Having asked if there was anything they could do, the answer for a table of 6 was ... 'not really, no' ... Being resourceful we ... Called take out pizza and Indian to the hotel, to be challenged by a member of staff when it arrived that we 'could not eat take out in the hotel' ... No problem we said, could they provide some food.... A stand off entailed... Which we won (easy option, man handle us and our food out, or we stay and eat it)...   In short, this is a hotel where everything is 'according to the process' the staff have seemingly little or not desire to work with the guests, and not much customer service focus. Others may well have had a better stay, but not that week.  Would I return, not a chance. 
-4; Visited the Health Spa on 17th October and paid the extortionately high rate of £15 for a pass arrived around 6pm was the last one to leave at 11pm only to realise next day i had left my shorts behind, returned to find they coudlnt be found, only one conclusion 
-4; We were booked into the White House by our company through Lastminute.com on the day of stay. The price was £360 per room breakfast not included. We arrived to two rooms that were so small you could only erect the ironing board by climbing over the bed. Given the price, I was horrfied. I was woken at 5,00 am by by next door neighbours chatting on the phone and to each other - it was so clear they may well have been in the same room the walls were that thin. When I tried to get into breakfast I queued for 10 minutes with people pushing into the line to gain access to the restaurant - eventually I gave in as I was not prepared to pay £23 for a cup of tea and croissant which was all I could have managed in the time available. While trying to check out, low and behold the system wasn't working so we couldn't get a receipt.  We stay in hotels on average 2 to 3 times a week. In all my many years of hotel dwelling, the price paid for this visit was the single biggest rip-off I have ever encountered! 
-4;" I am an experienced traveller. I have stayed at many hundreds of hotels. I booked a deluxe double at the Preston Marriott, through Booking.com, but was provided with a &quot;standard deluxe room&quot;. The confirmation from Booking.com stated it was a deluxe room, but the receptionist wasn't interested. So would you expect a deluxe room or a standard room? I questioned at check-in, is this a deluxe room? It's a standard deluxe room. Is that a deluxe room? It's a standard deluxe room.  On the ground floor, is never a good place to be. It was a standard room. The 1.5m bed was only a standard double bed, comfortable and clean but small. The shower was just a trickle, the lighting was all on or all off. It was rubbish. Stay away from this place. I asked on check-out if room 141 was a deluxe room. No it's a standard room, we call them standard deluxe. That is a misrepresentation. The supervisor came from his office and could offer nothing as an explanation. I used to like Marriott. I have stayed in one for a few years, preferring Hilton or Holiday Inn or Raddisson Blu. It will be a long time before I ever go to one again. "
-4;Public areas have been updated and look very modern, when entering your room it's like going back 20 years!! The rooms are dirty, curtains hanging off the rail, spill marks down the wall, carpet was marked and lifting, furniture old fashioned and seen better days! The bathroom was disgusting, mould all over the walls, dirty floor and generally tatty. Very disappointed that De Vere have such poor room standards in this hotel. After 4 hour journey i was too exhausted to go back to reception to complain and change room. I did inform reception who did not really care, also my colleague complained as was jsut to to fill out a feedback card!!
-4;" As we pulled up tho the valet parking area, a lovely english guy took our keys & checked us in..this turned out to be the best part of our stay!!!! the rooms were average at best, we didn't really mind too much & got on with it, when we went to the bar for a drink we found rude, non English speaking bartenders who were getting angry with the customers as all the drinks were being sent back, ( I had to teach him how to pour a pint of guinness much to the amusement of the other guests,. Dinner was too awful to describe.. everything was cold, unedible & unrecogniseable, I made do with a chip butty!!!!!!! Any complaints were returned with &quot;sorry nothing we can do! &quot; bottle of champagne was sent to the room with 1 flute & 1 red wine glass covered in lipstick.. we laughed it off but would never return & I urge you all to avoid. Mr & Mrs Curran, Oxford "
-4; Smelly place and very shabby. The pool was MINUTE, and the wine was a complete rip off at over £10 for a glass.  A really bad hotel and very bad for the brand Hilton. I have stayed in 2 star hotels that are better than this.  Avoid this place at all costs!!! 
-4;" My wife and I booked to stay here for one night in a King De Vere Suite to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was not cheap - £270 for room , dinner and breakfast as a package.Overall impression of hotel is that is dated and tired. Pre dinner drinks on the terrace were disturbed by two different male golfing parties who were loud and using crude and foul language with no regard for other guests. We gave up and went to dinner in the brasserie and chose the carvery which was a major disappointment as food was overcooked, over heated and watery. We were offered a glass of prosecco each to &quot;celebrate&quot; our anniversary which we thought was a nice touch until we saw that it was not complementary and we had been charged £6.50 a glass on our bill! When we went to bed we could not sleep as there was a wedding in the marquee in the grounds and they were playing loud music until 1.30am. We were then woken again by a faulty fire alarm at 3.30am. We phoned reception and they apologised. But we still could not sleep as some drunk was outside in the grounds singing in a loud voice. No one seemed to try to stop him. When we checked out in the morning no one asked how our stay was. It was rather busy with other guests checking out so we left and decided to send De Vere an email outlining our bad experience. This was sent to the customer services email address on the web site but so far we have had no acknowledgement let alone a reply or apology. If Dunston Hall wishes to book golfing and wedding parties and does not advise other guests of this when booking then that is a poor show and they will not get us staying there again. And if De Vere cannot be bothered to reply or even acknowledge our email then we will not be staying at any of their other venues. "
-4;In December I booked a room for three nights 30 April, I & 2 May, through Booking.com. To confirm the booking I had to make the full payment of £243 straight away. Late January I found that I would not be able to travel to Worcester at that time and tried to cancel. I was informed that I would not be refunded one penny of the amount I paid despite the hotel having three months minimum to relet the room. I had also made three other bookings through Booking.com for the period following the 2nd May and there was no problem with the cancellation I can only assume Ye Olde Talbot is so desperate for income that customer service goes out of the window. My advice to anyone travelling to Worcester is to take care where you make a booking !!!
-4; We were booked into The Granary restaurant, meant to be the best part of the hotel, it was terrible, we left without eating!! It was understaffed, which the waiter admitted, he said he didn't have a table for us, but when I insisted on telling him we had booked and my name he said our table was already in use by another couple and at least a 45 min wait! The food didn't smell that nice either, or even look appetising, so we left in disgust. The ambience was Little Chef standards. The drinks before dinner were not what was ordered, so a place to avoid. Having said that a snack lunch in the original 'To The Manor Born' part has been good, but don't go into or anywhere near the 'new' part of the hotel. Very disappointing. 
-4;   The walls are paper thin and unfortunately we had a couple of older ladies who decided to drink and shout in there room all night.....We heard every word and my 7 and 9 year old got very little sleep and they were going long past 2 am.   We complained to the ladies in question which fell on deaf ears. Reception were not available and didn't answer the phone! But the hotel clearly does not employ staff to walk the corridors at night and ensure guests are acting responsibly and with respect for other guests!   TRAVELODGE DO THAT !!!!!!  So in the morning children woke up early as they do!!! Myself and my wife needed a coffee! Proceeded to make a drink guess what......milk was sour and out of date! Rang reception for some more( they answered this time!) That was 30 minutes ago and we are still waiting as I right this!!!  Basically the although the hotel and spa look good scratch the surface and infrastructure is terrible. I am a construction professional and I can tell you that NO effort has been made the sound proof these rooms so if get inconsiderate guests next door you will NOT sleep and the hotel will NOT help.  How they got four stars I will never know....think they need to revisit to inspect again.  
-4; Two star pretending to be four star. The leisure facilities are poor, equipment always breaking down, grubby changing rooms, lights not working, I could go on but for the lack of space on this review. 
-4;I arrived about 3.30pm and tired, needing to get changed and do some work over a bite to eat and a glass of wine before meeting colleagues.  No in room iron. Very limited in room f&b facilities. No room service. The restaurant was closed. The bar was closed.   I had to walk to the opposite side of the exhibition centre to get food and drink.  I was told to wait for their facilities to open at 5pm....but why should I?   A hotel where you can't get food and drink is not a hotel in my opinion. The other side of Excel has a lovely Novotel, Ibis and Crowne Plaza. Much better.  
-4;" On arrival, we were given a room in the old part of the hotel, just behind the reception building. The room was spacious with new furniture and had a prison-like window. However, it smelled horrendous, a mixed of cigar smoke and air freshener, a truly unbearable combination. I went to the reception to ask for a different room, only to be told &quot;Well, on your booking, you did not specify that you want a non-smoking room&quot;. I felt like I am in the 1960s....   I explained that my girlfriend is allergic to a cigarette smoke and the receptionist reluctantly told me that the only rooms they have are on 4th floor above the reception. In a normal hotel, it wouldn't be an issue, you just enter the elevator and get out on the 4th floor. Not here - you need to walk up through a maze in order to reach the 4th floor. Once you do, you see that it is a pitched roof, so the usable area of the room, which is BTW 30-40% smaller than the first room we were given, is reduced even more. After we declined, they again reluctantly found us a room in another area of the hotel, next to the Tempo restaurant (which is more a pub than a restaurant). Walking there is a hassle and involves walking through another maze. Eventually, we reached the room, which was spacious, but the furniture was very worn out, probably from late 80s, early 90s. The minibar was not working. The room overlooked the carpark, with cars parked 2-3m from the window.  We went to eat at the Priory restaurant, and were told that everything is fully booked at 7PM when we went and that we should come after 9PM. We passed by the restaurant again at around 8.30PM and there was still nobody in. We asked again for a table, only to be told again that it is fully booked. Eventually, I asked if we can eat at the bar, adjacent to the restaurant and they agreed to serve us food, which was average, but at around £20 per main course, rather expensive for what it was. By the time we finished dinner, around 10.30PM, hardly anyone walked into the restaurant. Service was appalling   Such a shame the hotel's potential is not utilised, it could be a great property with a refurbishment and change of staff. At £120 a night very poor value and I will never come back.   BTW. I stay in hotels 80-100 days a year, but I've never experienced such a poor service "
-4;" Booked the East Cliff Hotel but was told only a few hours before that it was full and we were given the 'sister' hotel instead. For £250 per night it was very poor. Carpet in reception hadn't been hoovered and was tatty. The room (47) was very tired (but clean) and cheaply furnished. The bed was comfortable though. The bathroom needs redecorating and the shower was actually dangerous alternating from cold to scolding in seconds. At breakfast (Saturday morning 0900) the staff were completely overwhelmed - my partner's poached eggs never arrived despite asking 2 separate waitresses to go and check. There were even workmen in high-viz jackets slouched on the bench seat at one of the tables. For this amount of money I am very disappointed. Hallmark hotels need to sort out their booking system and review the levels of staffing and standards of furnishings if they think this hotel merits 4stars and £250 per night. Maybe the management should pop round to &quot;The Green House Hotel&quot; where I regularly stay to see how a proper hotel that charges less than £250 per night is furnished and managed. "
-4;" I have stayed at this hotel 5 or 6 times and always been happy with the hotel. All that good work undone. Noisy, noisy, noisy! Midnight doors closing, 3am baby crying, 4am banging on door down corridor, 4:30am people walking down corridor and at 6am some bloke threatening to take someones head off. Whilst you might say you can't blame the hotel I was asked if I wanted a quite part of the hotel and said yes. Imagine if I'd got the noisy part? What makes it worse is the girl on check out never asked if everything had been ok, probably a good thing. I don't think I'll return because I was knackered the next day:&lt; "
-4; Disinterested staff and very poor service. Recommend that you avoid to save inevitable frustration and disappointment. Bar service and food a major let down and dreadful value for money. I certainly will not be returning to this hotel. 
-4; We decided on Saturday afternoon to book a table at our local restaurant, where we have eaten many times entertaining both friends and business colleagues. On making the telephone call to the hotel, and pushing the correct option for the restaurant, I was told many times that there was no-one there to take my call. However I did manage to get through at about 5.00pm, after speaking to the main switchboard. On being shown to our table we were surprised to see that the restaurant was almost empty. At 8.30.pm I would have expected it to be full. My wife ordered sun blushed tomato and Goats cheese polenta balls and I ordered cola and BBQ braised port terrine. Her meal was totally bland and unexciting, although nicely presented.  My pork Terrine was in the shape of a round bale of hay, with absolutely no taste whatsoever, other than gherkin shavings which had been infused with vinegar.Both starters required a tasty dressing, or reduction, to give them a bit of a lift. For main course my wife choose savoury pumpkin and sweet potato pie,and again she said there was absolutely no taste. The pumpkin came in the form of a pie, no different to that you would buy at Greggs, and showered with a large quantity of Pecan nuts. I choose the Rosemary marinated leg of lamb steak, and when it arrived I could not believe what I was looking at. I requested the lamb medium well, but it was almost black on the outside, and way over cooked. On the plate was 4 chunky chips, and a half of a tomato. This was probably the worst cooked, and certainly the worst presented main course I have seen in a very long while, and after using this restaurant on many many occasions, was particularly disappointed. I have never been served chips with lamb before, but regardless, the meal was so tough and bland that it also needed a reduction or, dressing to give it a more flavoured taste.  As far as our meals went, it is obvious that this restaurant has gone a long long way downhill, and someone in authority need to get hold of it, re-write the menus, and offer good quality food. Normally we wouldnt be concerned if some restaurant that we frequent was going downhill,because we simply wouldnt go back, but a restaurant on our doorstep, and one where we have spent a lot of money in the past serving us poor fare, is extremely disappointing to say the least. On a good note the service was as good as ever. 
-4;"We had breakfast in their Executive Lounge - OMG! what a failure! First, we came in the Lounge, and 2 members of staff sitting behind 2 switched off computers, barely acknowledged us. No, we have not been taken to our table, but left to find one in an overcrowded room. Finally, 1 available table, but uncleared from previous guests. We sit there and wait somebody to clean that table. After a few minutes I went to those 2 staff at the reception (who were very &quot;busy&quot; to chic-chat away) and asked if we could get the table cleared so we can use it. The 2 finally decide to turn their eyes towards the busy room and one of them comes to our table to clean it. Now, can we please have a tea and a coffee? No, wait! This is a self-service operation! The word &quot;Executive&quot; is just a hoax. So, teas and coffees at the cheap machine, if you are lucky to find an empty cup. I used to work as a HR & Training Manager for a competitor chain and - vocational habit - could not stop counting the &quot;Don't&quot;s in this deceiving experience: no cups available, no plates, few forks but no spoons, no STAFF around to help, clients left to their own devices - I mean no difference between the Exec Lounge at Hilton Metropole and the Days Inn we stopped at on M3, on our way back to Southampton! Oh, wait, the only HUGE difference, is the price! Agrrrr!!!!"
-4; We booked a deluxe room and a standard room. The standard room was a better quality than the deluxe room and they charged £10 more for the deluxe.  The deluxe room had paper peeling in the bathroom, and the carpet didn't fit in the bedroom area.  The deluxe room was in desparate need of refurbishment. If you are going to stay book a standard room and not the deluxe. 
-4;The staff was inattentive especially at dinner where it took over 3 hours to have our meal. At no point during the meal were we offered drinks (not even water for our table) or an explanation as to why it was taking so long. There was no excuse regarding the volume of diners either as there were only a few tables occupied. My room was less than fantastic also, I was on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel in a room where the windows didn’t shut properly giving a draught all night, it had a blind to shield the window which was dirty, frayed at the edges and was bowing at the sides not covering the entire window. The bathroom was not clean both there were long hairs on the floor and surfaces which were not mine. Overall I was very disappointed by the venue and the staff. They all seemed disinterested and didn’t even ask if I had had a pleasant stay.
-4;Christmas Day meal with my family was an absolute disaster at Dunston Hall. There were no Xmas decorations, no Xmas music and zero atmosphere. Staff were polite but limited in numbers. Had to queue for a £15-19 pound carvery when we paid £70 each. Had to clear our own main meal plates to make room for the sweet. Complained to the manager on the day but had to wait 15 mins to do so. I contained my anger, left him my telephone number and he promised to phone
-4;the rooms wear too much furniture in them for start the bathroom not clean and the breakfast staff just too much on top of you all the time and always in your face will not stay hear again and over priced
-4; For what purports to be a 4 star hotel the Birmingham Metropole falls way below the standards I have come to expect from the Hilton group The first room I was offered smelt terribly due to the room above having leaked water into the room. There was peeling wall paper and frayed carpets. Not what you would expect for £120 a night!! Reception did move me to another room but this was little better being equally shabby. But the worst was yet to come!! During the night I received several insect bites!! When I informed reception of this in the morning they said they would refer the matter to the Health & Safety Manager who was 'conviniently' unavailble! I was eventually contacted by email by an assistant manager who all but accused me of making the episode and asked for photos of the bites. These I have attached to this revie so other travellers will be warned If you have business at the NEC stay anywhere but here! 
-4;" The highlight of my two day stay here was the 24hour McDonald's that's about 5mins walk from the hotel. TV didn't work, beds were really hard, room not properly cleaned on arrival (a used tissue was on the floor), no main light for the room, had to rely on the low powered wall lamps, it was dark. Opening the wardrobe door was like pulling the sword from the stone, the shower was either an inferno or Antarctica, and then the restaurant. Oh my dear Lord. I am a foodie, I watch my weight and go to the gym every day, but I love my food, and I love to cook. I feel offended that they even had the audacity to call their on site restaurant a &quot;restaurant&quot;. It was abysmal. Our starter is where it all began, overly swamped in vinegar tart, no butter with the bread for soup. Onto the main course, they couldn't even manage to cook potato wedges correctly. They had the cheek to charge 15-16£ whatever it was for a bag of Quinoa and the smallest portion of salmon known to man. The wedges were truly awful. Drenched in oil, more seasoning than there was potato, and soggy. We also ordered a curry, and they couldn't manage to even cook the rice! We complained to the waiter, who replied with &quot;uh&quot; and walked off. We complained again, nothing happened again. We then ordered dessert. How dare they. They couldn't even make a sticky toffee pudding for Christ's sake. The sponge was visibly dry, and when I bit into it, it was not only dry, but rock hard. The sauce was separated and grim, and ice cream sloppily presented. I requested to see the chef, who refused to make an appearance, a sign that he knew he / she had done a terrible job.   Trip advisor made me rate this place one star, but all in all, I rate this place a strong 0/10. Would NEVER stay again. "
-4; I'm not one for leaving negitive feedback but in this case I feel obliged to. Things started to look bad as soon as I walked into my room, it was then I reslised that I had been given a smoking room without anybody telling me before I checked in!? The room smelt like stale smoke, the sofa also smelt terrible and the steam room downstairs smelt like sweaty socks!! The thing that topped it off for me was that no water or any kind of beverage was available to purchase through the night? Not even a vending machine?? I asked a guy on reception where we could get drinks from and he told us the nearest shop was a 15 minute walk away!! I will definitely not be coming back to a hotel that charges £175 a night for that kind of service!! Not happy!!! 
-4;We turned up at 6:30pm and were told our rooms weren't ready no apologies or anything. key cards didnt work properly staff were rude saing not you again cant b bothered with this tonight. Carpets were dirty with cigarette burns on them.
-4; I arrived at 11pm and was given a Club Room (room 021). The room was well appointed but, as I soon realised, useless as a sleeping chamber unless you are in the fortunate position where incredible noise and severe vibrations coming from a generator outside the window helps you to drift off. The staff clearly know about this issue, as other reviews on here point to the same issue, but no doubt they continue to peddle this room to weary travellers in the hope that someone will stick with it. I asked to move and they were ok with that, albeit the staff were generally ill mannered and uncaring. Sorry is not a word in their lexicon. The replacement room in the basement was fine and free of noise. I was pleased to depart in the morning. I have stayed in other Shaftesbury hotels in the Paddington/Hyde Park area and have generally found them to be good - this one perhaps has an unwelcome reputation developing. 
-4;" We stayed at the Guoman Tower Hotel primarily because of its location next to the Tower of London as we had to attend the event there the following morning. we booked 3 rooms; A Suite, a connecting Deluxe Double and a further Deluxe Double. Booking the rooms was great and the reservation staff were very informative, even able to tell me exactly which rooms we would be staying in some 6 weeks prior to arrival. Upon getting to the hotel (we drove) we parked in the car park and unloaded our cases, children and pram only to find the only way out of the car park and into the hotel is up 20+ large steps with no lift and no call button to ask for help. Disabled visitors take note as (we later found out during check out) the only option is to drive out of the car park and round to a side door where there is a ramp. We were checked in by a trainee, which I have no problem with as everybody needs to start somewhere and being checked in by a trainee has usually lead to a more pleasant experience. However, our fairly simple requests (were the connecting doors open in the room, could all the rooms be put on one bill) were greeted with a brief &quot;ok&quot; and never acted upon. Even the supervising staff member didn't offer any assistance to the clearly struggling trainee. Then we asked for room keys to open all the rooms, which we were told couldn't be done (we've done it at this very hotel before). After giving my card over for 3 individual room bookings we went up to our room only to find the connecting doors were locked. A quick call to reception and we were told someone was on their way. 45 minutes later, a further call to reception was greeted with the same response. Almost an hour after calling down did someone come up. The Deluxe Doubles seemed to all be in quite good order, but the suite needed a major upgrade. Door didn't fit the door frames, the carpet had huge rips in it, cupboards didn't close properly and the blinds didn't work as they should. Once the kids were asleep we went out to dinner (no way we were dining in the hotel after our check in experience) and walked across St Katherine's Docks to the Dickens Inn which I highly recommend. When we got back, my wife went to take a shower only to be greeted with freezing cold water. It took over 15 minutes for any warm water to trickle through and even then it was tepid. The next morning we got breakfast in our room which was the one redeeming quality as the amount of food you get is much better than some hotels. We went to our function and came back that afternoon to check out. We had booked a late check out but were told it had to be done at reception, which we did when we checked in and it was noted down by the trainee. However, none of our key cards worked so it meant taking kids etc back down to reception to get new key cards for all the rooms. When we finally got it, one of the managers very kindly ignored the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign and barged in to check the state of the room, assuming it had been cleaned. We got our stuff and we down to check out. This involved paying individually for 2 rooms, but they'd very kindly already charged and billed us for the main room the night before. This meant none of our extras appeared on our bill and the trainee checking us out didn't know what to do. After negotiating a broken ticket machine for the car park we eventually left what has been our worst hotel experience in London so far out of several dozen stays. The hotel is ideal for visiting the Tower of London and the surrounding areas, and the quality of the bed etc was fine so for the basic necessities it fit the bill. However, we were looking for a nice relaxing family trip away in a luxury room and definitely didn't get that. "
-4; Stayed for one-night was disturbed by hoovering at 2.30am went out to ask the cleaners to stop only to be rudely ignored complaint put in to duty manager to be offered a free pastrie for breakfast as a sorry not good enough worst hilton I have stayed in 
-4; The food in this hotel is terrible, Stay here with a coach party and they could not care less about the party. The worst think about the restaurant was the breakfast as it was a joke, no clear instructions for procedures of ordering eggs and you had to make your own toast!! Spoon for getting the mushrooms was covered in baked beans, no spoons/tongs for each item you required and also the lights on the hot plate wasn’t on, on two mornings during my stay and also there was no cover/lid over the relevant items in the food stand to keep them warm, e.g. the bacon, sausages, and scrambled eggs trays just opened to the world and anything could be getting to the food like flies and stuff. Complaints to management and staff in restaurant after problem with the meal was a completed joke, the food which was served was cottage pie which was absolutely freezing when I got my serving, the wedges which accompanied it was half cook and the vegetable were hard and cold, and this was the point where everyone had enough, and when complains started the staff didn’t take it very well. So be aware staying in this hotel use the McDonalds next door to the hotel you might be served a better meal. On the other side the rooms in the hotel are lovely clean, very well presented and just recently refurbished. The pool in the hotel by the new owner has recently been completed and the service which you received was first class and everything in very presentable order and I did speak to the manager of the pool during my stay and commented how lovely it was. 
-4; We stayed here the first week of Easter holidays, 2014. We went on the quite field with our caravan, Quite is the opposite to what we received, workman trundled past the caravan from 7am in there large dumpers (no safety gear worn at all, even when using large chainsaws) with no regards to the people who were on holiday there. 7.30am came an almighty bang, 7.31am the first of many euro fighter planes came flying over the camp with engines roaring, All these events continued throughout the day with very little rest bite. The new swimming pool is very small and the changing and shower areas were very dirty. Entertainment??? What Entertainment?? You were ok on Friday & Saturday nights other than that it was karaoke. Have to give them the benefit that the showers were clean and hot on the camp site. 
-4;We went to Formby Hall for afternoon tea as a Virgin Experience.  The service was lack lustre and food poor. Our sandwiches had been prepared for some time and were drying out, but being hungry, we ate them. The scones were warm, which was nice, but only because they had been microwaved to the point of being biscuited on the inside. The cakes were OK, as was the tea when it finally arrived.  Sir Richard would not be impressed, and neither were we. Afternoon tea for two at my local deli would be no more than half the price of this and be way better.  
-4; This hotels has obviously seen better days. Decoration has been left to slip to an unacceptable level, with missing paint on hand rails tatty rooms, broken fixtures and fittings, trays of room service food left in hallways for days. All this shows a hotel that doesn't care. The only saving grace was the the staff. At least they tried. Had I not been attending a function , I probably would have left straight away. Avoid this hotel, as there are many others in the area with better reputations. 
-4; Something seemed to be seriously amiss at the Malmaison Oxford Castle Hotel during our two night stay at the end of October. Judging by the number of complaints from other customers both on this site and those that we observed while staying there problems are manifest.   We were attracted to the hotel by the quite brilliant concept of the adaptation of a former prison into a luxury hotel and it is a truly wonderful setting with great potential. However, the two service encounters that we had were very unsatisfactory.   The management of the Brasserie and level of training of staff seemed inadequate! Very slow service which is very difficult for a family with a young child, a special October half-term menu with two of the four main dishes unavailable and a replacement steak option only made available after prompting, beer available in 2/3 measures only with the explanation that this is to stop customers from 'binge drinking', unused wine glasses and empty beer glass left on table through duration of sitting, medium-rare steak served rare and amusingly, sources served in solid state (garlic butter and blue cheese).   The front desk staff were sullen and the staff member who checked us in sat in a raised chair making the encounter feel quite awkward. The check in process was cumbersome and new guests were not aknowledged when they arrived.   Some policies seem odd as well. A deposit of £100 was charged in addition to the cost of the room. With such high room charges we were disappointed to find that breakfast was not included in the price. We heard once customer who had paid £230 for a standard room and was also charged £27 for two breakfasts. Information about breakfast is conspicuous by its absence on the website.  The worst aspect of the experience, however, is that as guests complained about the service, staff did not seem that interested or motivated to do anything. No further enquiries were made, nothing was recorded and no further action was promised. This does not auger well for a quick return to form and we certainly won't be returning in a hurry. 
-4; I have stayed with the Hilton at various locations many times over and never had a problem in the past. However the Birmingham Hilton Metropole is VERY dated. Rooms are cold. If staying in rooms located via Lift Lobby B then you will have to contend with a very loud generator/aircon unit outside your room all night.   Main problems.  * Beds are very small and uncomfortable. * Rooms are dirty and extremely dated in need of dire refurbishment. * TV picture quality is pathetic, more snow than the North Pole and TV is slow/unresponsive.  * One of the lifts in Lobby B constantly breaks down leaving only one other small lift. * Water pressure for the shower needs some attention, although plenty of hot water available. * Room furniture is falling apart, wall paper hanging off walls and black heat marks around TV  It is such a shame that the Hilton name is attached to such a dated hotel. I would not be able to recommend this hotel to anyone (enemies included) as the quality does not match the brand.   On a good note however, the staff are generally polite and helpful. 
-4; My wife and I stayed at the Imperial to celebrate her 30th birthday, for what should have been a relaying spa break. Whilst I can not fault the location of the hotel, everything else was awful. From the duty manager who almost delighted in explaining that it was our fault for not booking the spa in advance when we arrived to find out there were appointments available. This disappointment was quickly followed by the bar man who left 4 people waiting as he was so determined to take his break, i particualry enjoyed his someone should be with you shortly, but you might have to wait a bit, exit comment. I could go on and on, but to cut it short: this hotel was once great, now it trades on a great location and that is it. If you are headed to Torquay stay somewhere else but take a trip up to the terrace bar at the Imperial for great views on a sunny day, just make sure your glass does not have black mold on like some of ours did! 
-4; Good check in and smart hotel and amenities right at Gatwick North terminal, so very convenient. Unfortunately marred by a 2:00am evacuation false alarm into the cold car park. No staff assistance it took nearly 15 minutes to get out via the packed stairwell, thank god it was a false alarm!!!! At checkout no apologies or explanations, no offer of discount on future stays and staff wholly disinterested. Appalling attitude.  I don't expect a complete refund in these situations I am aware that some things are outside the Hotels control, but the attitude of the staff was poor considering I effectively wasted £145:00 which was not my fault either! I small discount voucher on a future stay with the group would have been nice but an apology for the lost money and sleep should have been automatic... I doubt I'll use this hotel again. 
-4; Booked a table for Mother's Day at 1.30 for 6 including two small children....upon arrival we were informed our table wasn't ready and we were told to wait in an unspecified room with no offer of drinks,menus or information about when our table would be ready.After returning to the restaurant to ask how long our wait would be we were served 3 flat lime and sodas when we ordered 4.When we finally got seated approximately 40 minutes later we didn't even receive menus from the supposed assistant manager for another 15 minutes and were not approached by any member of staff for a drink...when you pay a £60 deposit for a table then pay £27.50 per head you expect a little bit of table service from the countless members of staff who just wandered past our table on several occasions.After complaining about this we finally got a waiter to take our drinks order which took a further 10 minutes to arrive and my wine was served in a lipstick stained wine glass.I asked for a different clean glass and didn't receive this for another 10 minutes.when our food finally arrived it came served on a wet slate and was a passable starter at best.After waiting 15 minutes for our table to be cleared the next course (a cream of vegetable soup) arrived which can only be described as inedible...watery,tasteless and on the verge of insulting.This prompted us to simply cut our losses and leave before the main as we had booked a table for 1.30 and hadn't even been served our main before 3 o'clock.As we left I spoke to the assistant manger who was so out of her depth and lacking in any customer service skills,asking for our deposit back as the service and food were so poor that we simply wanted to go somewhere else and she replied that she would have to speak to her manager.We waited for ten further minutes whilst her staff made fun of my family for making a fuss!!The assistant returned to say she had interrupted her very busy manager as a favour to us but he would not be speaking to us directly and we couldn't have our deposit back.the assistant manager became very defensive and outright rude at our request to receive a refund.no apology just a whole load of poor excuses which quite frankly ruined Mother's Day.The organisation was incredibly poor and there were plenty of other tables openly complaining about the service.my family and I will be writing directly to the manager to return our deposit and we will never be returning. 
-4; Checking in was hard work, they didn't have my booking and finally found it, saying I'd booked for July. I offered my phone to show I hadn't made a mistake, but she wasn't interested.  My room was dated, not especially clean and had a view of a flat roof. It was adequate, like the shower - it worked but just about.  I wandered down to reception to complain about the TV not working and was told there was nothing they could do. The attitude of the receptionist was appalling.  The food in the bar was pub standard, good service though and hot. £4.50 a pint for lager was a little steep. The menu was limited, and if you don't like chips, then you won't have much choice at all. I think some of the staff may have been training, orders were getting lost, bills weren't being signed for and there was general confusion - that said, with all that going on around me, everything I ordered turned out OK.   I had room 105, this didn't suffer from any of the noise issues others have complained about and the bed was ok (only ok, but ok nonetheless).  I'm in hotels a lot for business and try to stay at smaller ones where I can. I've never encountered such uninterested and unhelpful staff.    
-4; Firstly I booked the hotel via holiday extras and these guys are just as useless. They don't state the hotel terms, the hotel doesn't care about this, and to be honest it leaves a bad taste. We arrive at the hotel which with the pay for 'forgotten items' vending machines (tooth paste etc) reminded me of a 2 star ibis.   Arriving we were asked for a 50 pound pre auth, which wasn't stayed in any terms and they couldn't show me this anywhere. I had checked prior to arrival and couldn't find it, holiday extras certainly don't state it.   We didn't get cash out prior to arrival, but I called before hand and they said they had a cash point, excellent. We stayed the night, the room was ok 2/3 star travel lodge ibis style, but the thing that astounded me was the rudeness and direct staff. This is a 4 star marriot and not in the standard you'd expect from the brand. We checked out, the cash point wasn't working, and they wouldn't give us any cash back from a transaction. The bus to the terminal is 3 pound each and as we had no changed we were advised that we could walk - rain, and motorways are between the hotel and the airport and I was gobsmacked. In the end we were ripped off 12.50 for a taxi taking 5 minutes.   The best was yet to come - the receptionist took our card, called the taxi and then began reciting the card number aloud. Crazy!   You pay about 10-15 cheaper for this hotel than the on site airport hotels like the premier - avoid this at all cost! Terrible on every level, the staff need some serious training 
-4;" Oh and thats if your on spg platinum! I paid cash for my room and was not asked for a credit card for extras at check in. Ordered a Pizza in room service that was cold and nasty the bill was £12 and the waiter said he could not take cash but allowed me to sign it to the room. When I went to check out I waited 20 minutes again just to pay for this crappy pizza however I was going to miss my flight if I stayed longer the reception staff did not know their right arm to their left. I figured starwood have my credit cards so they will just auto bill the £12 pizza. A week or two later I got an email from one paulo osorio demanding payment which is fine, I emailed them back with my card details to charge and the email was not accepted as it contained credit card numbers....so they sent me a link to follow to enter my details into a &quot;secure&quot; website to pay for my pizza, I tried to do this it also did not work. Then I got an email from spg saying they were blocking my starwoood account untill this pizza was paid for (i have spent in 2016 over 20k with spg) "
-4; Found the staff very rude, especially the bar staff, the pool was closed all day which really upset our two kids who had been looking forward to it, couple of people in our group ill from the food they ate, got the breakfast order wrong, overall shame as it is a lovely location. 
-4;Whilst I know Travelodge is a budget hotel. £300 for 3 nights in London is still quite a lot of money. Frustrating as the majority of staff do not understand English. The room was OK but the smell from the drains in the bathroom not good. Bed was large and comfy (the only good point). Toilets were out of order downstairs so everyone had to use the ladies which were dirty. Breakfast buffet was a scramble. Actually saw someone drop a serving spoon and put it back! My advice would be to spend more money and stay elsewhere.
-4;" It might be considered that this review is a little unfair given that the main problems were beyond the control of the hotel, however they do impact on the quality of our stay. The problems began on arrival. I had booked the hotel because I used to dine there in my younger days before moving to Scotland. It had been my hope to stay there with my wife and share my experience of fine dining at the Castle. I was aware that the hotel was still owned by the same family and had a certain expectation of continuity.   However I was wrong, apparently a year ago, the current family owner closed the fine dining restaurant!!! Shock. horror. It then transpired that the only restaurant at the Castle was the &quot;trend setting&quot; BRAZZ bistro that looked from the outside like a 1960's retro Discoteque. Shock. Horror.   We were allocated to room 11 located next to an archway that offered pedestrian access to the high street. The room was really nice, it looked as if it had recently been decorated and the matching co-ordination of curtains, carpets, wallpaper and cushion fabrics was most attractive. A really well done piece of work that created a really nice ambience. We then went for a walk in the grounds and found the Castle garden most attractive.  Regarding evening meals during our 4 day stay I am afraid that the Castle's loss was everyone else's gain. We ate at Ciao Amore, French Connection, the Willow Tree and Augustus. More importantly when I totalled up the restaurant bills, I found that the Castle had dipped out on over £600 worth of revenue from meals we ate elsewhere.  This leads neatly into the next section of this review which deals with ambience. Having eaten and drunk really well in the locality we returned to our hotel anticipating a good night's sleep. In this respect we were sadly mistaken. On Monday and Tuesday there were 2 fights that woke us up at Midnight. On Wednesday there was a pitched fight that was split over 2 hours from 23:00 to 01:00. At one point I arose to find that a guys head was being pushed into a planter by his drunken girlfriend! The screaming and shouting even roused the hotel security who went out to remonstrate with them, but this was to no avail and the fight sporadically continued punctuated by occasion visits back to the pub!   Finally we got back to sleep only to be awakened by the next problem that we experienced during our stay, namely the recycling wagons and cardboard compacting trucks. In Taunton the recycling contracts appear to be held by different contractors. We worked this our quite quickly because they recycled at 06:15, 06:30, 06:45, and 07:00. The incredible crash of breaking bottles and the massive noise from the engines of thevhydraulic compaction equipment was enough to wake the dead! However this leads me neatly into the final problem we faced during our stay.  Having being woken up quite effectively by 07:00, we had hoped we would be able to roll over and get back to sleep. It was not to be. Somerset County Council happened to be paving the Castle Hotel precincts as part of an improvement project and on the dot at 07:30, the stone cutters started up. For those reading this review who have never heard a stone cutter being used at close quarters, it produces a decibel level greater than a Boeing 747 jumbo jet taking off. Needless to say that was the final straw regarding our chances of sleep.  Having paid £550 for our stay, it was ruined by circumstances outside the hotel's control, but sadly ruined it.  My final word. Due to lack of a fine dining restaurant, drink filled idiots, waste recycling, and reconstruction, guests at the moment might want to think seriously about their stay at this hotel or at least try to avoid room 11 and those ajacent to them at the front of the hotel. I really do feel sorry for the owner because the problems resulting in my rating can only be resolved with some difficulty and they were, apart from the restaurant closure, beyond the owner's control. "
-4; Stayed here for a night last night - charged nearly £200 to sleep in a (miniature) sauna with the compensation for lack of facilities being....a free bottle of water.  As others have stated there's no aircon in the rooms - if I had to stay again I'd sleep in the corridor where it appeared to be working. The window in the room did open but only to reveal a rotten/flaking window sill  Water pressure was poor and shower hose split so more water came out of hose than shower head  And finally as others have mentioned the single lift with a capacity of 4 seems to be an ongoing issue - don't count on getting to/from your room quickly at peak times 
-4; I wish that I had looked at this site before booking a stay here. Upon arrival after a long day's travel at 10.45pm, I was told that a room was not available due to a water leak (as a number have complained about here but I have a feeling that they were overbooking rooms) and that I would be transferred to a sister hotel of comparable quality (I later discovered - Shaftesbury Premier on 55-61 Westbourne Terrace) albeit they couldn't tell me the address there and then. Instead I was bundled into a taxi and driven off into the night. I was deposited in front of a hotel where they weren't aware of my arrival which necessiated several phone calls to resolve. Whereas the previous foyer was clean, bright and modern with a view to the bar and TV room, this new hotel has a distinctly grubbier feel about it. The seats on the sofas in the foyer were stained a very noticeable yellow. I was shown 3 inadequate, tiny, dark rooms with no hint of any rebate on the fee. I was offered a complimentary breakfast which in the end I did not take up - the surroundings did not fill me with confidence about hygiene. After expressing my displeasure at being so royally dicked around, they just smiled politely and said that they could not do anything to help. An American couple overhearing our discussion commented that they had had problems booking in too. The room was clean but tiny and although on the basement was not overheated like a lot of others. That small ray of hope aside, I feel that I have been scammed into paying for a 4* hotel only to be shipped to a 2/3*. I would ring in advance to confirm if there will be any problems with the *ahem* leak otherwise avoid. 
-4; We recently went on holiday to Mexico and stayed overnight in the hotel at Manchester Airport and took advantage of their park & stay option to leave our car with them while we were on holiday. On our return we went to collect our car and we were told it was in Zone 6 ready for collection. On examining our car we noticed a large crack in the front bumper of our car and we went and reported it to the receptionist who in turn got the valet parking manager to come and meet us and see the damage. He took some photos the damage and told us not to worry as they would get it fixed as they were insured. We got an e mail from them saying they are not liable as the damage was caused before they moved the car from where we parked it. We parked the car in zone 4 on Saturday 4th July and handed in the keys at 6.30am on the Sunday 5th July. APCOA who are contracted run the secure parking for Crowne Plaza are saying the car was damaged between us handing over the keys on Sunday morning the 5th July and when they moved it on Tuesday the 7th July and they are not liable as they hadn't moved the car till the Tuesday as it was still classed as being in the hotel car park and is still the responsibility of Crowne Plaza and Crowne Plaza say they are not responsible as your car is parked at your own risk in their car park. They also say that your car may be taken offsite for secure parking this was not the case with us our car stayed in the hotel car park for the duration. They told us they take photos of your car before they even get in it to check for damage on the photo they sent us our daytime running lights are on and the ignition has to be on for these lights to work and it was not where we parked it. The strange thing is they said they only moved it from zone 6 in their car park to zone 8. This is strange as our paperwork clearly says it was left in zone 4 and we collected it in zone 6 on our return. The photo they have taken of the damage wasn't taken where we left the car as it was in a completely different area of the car park and how could it only have been moved from zone 6 to zone 8 as they are saying if we collected it from zone 6?? They also say that their car parks are covered by CCTV when we asked to see the CCTV they told us they couldn’t show us it due to data protection and it only sweeps round the car park and could have missed it, after speaking to our insurers they told us the only people they have to show CCTV to are the police and it has to have been reported as a crime.  Please do not use this hotel if you want your car to be kept safe as they will deny everything. The customer service of both the hotel and their car parking contractor is appalling. We have travelled abroad for many years and have left our car in various airport car parks and have never had any damage done to our car. You would think a company of their size would be able to keep your car safe when they had it on their premises. 
-4; Stayed for a business conference. Hotel seemed to think that a single bed for a business guest was acceptable. When asked to swap for a room with a double bed, attitude of staff was appalling.   Team had dinner. One of the team had to return their main course as the food was inedible. Another team member could eat less than half as the quality was so bad. My fish pie was only big enough to feed a child.  Asked for a drink in the residents' bar before retiring to bed (before midnight). Told by staff that the bar was closed and that we had to buy whatever we wanted from the shop and take it to our rooms.  Staff attitude was awful. They were not interested in the fact that we have regularly used this hotel for conferences and meetings over the last 3 years. We had 100+ delegates attending for a conference today but they didn't care.  Supposed to be 4 star but no water in the room and Kenko coffee sachets with paper cups.  Better staff attitude, better quality rooms and better quality food at Premier Inn .... Oh and much cheaper too!  Doubt we will ever use this hotel again! 
-4; Very disappointed with the relaxing Spa break. The pool and changing rooms were far from relaxing, over run with children for swimming lessons, cleanliness left a lot to be desired. Not the sort of thing you expect to find on a relaxing break. My husband counted 6 children in what was a very tiny changing room, he had to wait 10 minutes to change. I don't think we'd return to a Q hotel for fear of encountering this again. They need to decide what they want to be. 
-4;" This hotel is a joke surely. I paid £330 a night for a single room and it was terrible. They used the lowest wattage bulbs possible to give it a real dark and depressing feeling but also probably to make it harder to notice that the decor is in desparate need of overhaul. The furniture is so old that all the varnish is flaking off. It really felt like travelling back to the 80's  On arrival I went to get the iron from the wardrobe only to find it wasn't there. So I got the phone to call reception and found that that didn't work so had to go back down to reception to report both failings.  The carvery restaurant wasn't much better. I wanted a really quick meal as I had work to do so thought a carvery would be a quick option. Alas no, I was told that I couldn't just have a main course as it was a fixed price for 3 courses and they didn't have a price for just a main course.  The second night I decided to take some frustration out in the gym. I got up there and my card didn't open the door. So back to reception to be told that there was an extra charge for that and it was only free for &quot;executive&quot; rooms. After speaking to the manager and pointing out that I'd paid £330 a night for a dump of a room they begrudgingly let me use it free.  This hotel has only one thing going for it - the view and it is charging outlandish prices as a result. This has to be the worst I've stayed in in London and really feels like a step down from Tavel Inns.   ONE TO AVOID!!! "
-4;"Watch out for this hotel. It is mediocre - claims to be 4 star but is really a scruffy 3 star at best.  I recently stayed in the Hotel and noticed that they tried to charge me for phone calls I hadn't made. The desk manager assured me that they would deduct these from the bill.   I got my credit card statement and they were there on the statement.  I phoned the hotel twice and was promised that this would be sorted out - but no reply on two occasions. I have written to them twice and not had a reply. I have therefore registered the payments as a &quot;dispute&quot; with my credit card provider and hope they can sort it out.  The service at the hotel is shockingly bad and some of their desk staff are positively rude.  If you are booked to stay there - check your bill carefully.  If you haven't booked - avoid."
-4;I have spent the last hour trying to book into the offer at the Sheraton Heathrow which I clicked on because it included up to 8 days parking. But i was suspicious that the offer did not include parking as I was led to believe. Before i pressed the final button, i thought better to phone and check because after the initial lead-in there was no further mention of inclusive parking. my suspicions were confirmed when i asked the phone operator.  Booking a hotel is often difficult but this was just outright misleading!
-4; Very expensive stay in a hotel that's in very bad decorative order and dirty rooms , bar prices expensive ,overall not a pleasant stay. Staff, generally ok , however no assistance with baggage available , food poor, limited TV channels in room on a very date old TV . Would not recommend , nothing more than an over priced travel lodge not what you expect for the Hilton brand ! 
-4; Stayed here in October 2012 for 2 nights due to training in the area and did not want to commute from nearby.  Gym was good and change facilities good but the steam room is smelly dirty and germ ridden, so bad i am going to report this to the council. Foods in the bar and grill was very good and worth the money, drinks fine and the staff great. Parking is fanatstic even when the women park in disabled bays to go to the fitness classes, its ok the disabled can park away - so selfish. Apart from the steam room top marks. 
-4; I always feel it's important to consider the price point and star rating of a hotel when writing reviews. From the perspective of the rate we paid and the location, this hotel is very good value for money.  However, there are fundamental problems which totally undermines this:  - cleanliness: quite simply our room (439) was filthy, the mattress stained as if it had been used in a squat, and the bed partially collapsed. The bathroom, by contrast, was immaculate.  - service: the front desk staff are grumpy and disinterested in the guests. When problems are presented they simply recite pre-rehearsed answers (as you can even see in the hotel's responses to other feedback here on Trip Advisor. Take note Mercure, copy and pasted answers suggest a lack of interest and attention and fails to recognise guests as individuals).  I will never stay here again due to these issues, which is a shame as the price and location are spot on. 
-4; The hotel public areas are ok, however if my room is typical of all the others then stay clear. Very old and shabby, carpets are worn through so much they have disintegrated, the toilet flush is bearing hanging on, and looks like it's been re-sealed a hundred times. The furniture looks older than me and the bed is older than me. The lighting in the car parks is poor and doesn't feel secure with all the thieves operate in this area signs everywhere confirming your . Generally speaking you get what you pay for.... If that's the case then you would need to pay me to stay here again. See my photos. 
-4;"If I had wanted to end up at a nightclub I would have gone to one. This hotel is pure noise from early evening unill the early hours. Boom box racket from the function rooms. I'm told it's like this every Friday and weekend. Don't imagine your going here to sleep, because the management are too busy making money from events and functions to care about hotel guests. And they won't do anything about it. I complained 5 times and my room was on the other side of the hotel; I hate to think what the poor people trying to sleep above the noise had to contend with."
-4; There's so many reasons why you shouldn't stay here it would take too long to list. The absolute major problem is that its in the middle of a major road development, its impossible to get to and has no parking. But honestly that's not the only thing wrong. There is NOTHING to recommend this place - please don't stay here!! You have been warned 
-4;Well this was the worst I have had no selection of teas brought to the table . virtually no service after the sandwiches and cakes were left on the table. I have had better service at the local cafe. they need to go to Park side to see how its done in style. there is no style here you sit in the lounge with all the guests waiting to leave or what ever. Very disappointing with the so called Afternoon Tea. We asked for a coffee so as not to have to come back to often this came in the giant two handle cups. Definitely will not try it again
-4; stayed on a 2 night break hotel substandard in need of an good clean up and make over room are nothing flash yes its and expensive hotel that's why I booked it thinking I was getting quality well I must say I have stayed at cheaper and hade better quality the rooms are substandard for the price you pay but never mind I will never recommend or use again the staff are the only good thing about the place the manager doesn't even ring you back when you ring to complain and better still ring customer services to lodge a complaint and they say a director will look in to it and come back to you with an explanation well guess what 2 and a half weeks later no call so please be aware when booking this place try Storrs hall much better quality for your money I have told all my staff never to use this chain again and if they do I will not be signing expenses off for them 
-4; This is a nice building and rooms are ok but on the small side. The breakfast has a very limited choice, the coffee was stale and the ordered food didn't turn up after 25 minutes. The evening restaurant staff were horrendous. It's like a non funny version of Fawlty Towers. We waited 30 minutes for drinks to arrive and thence re was no flexibility with the food options. It was also a very quiet night in there - 4 tables? 
-4; We were very upset to arrive back after an over night flight to be told by reception they did not have a room for us this was confirmed we would have a room waiting when we returned it was 630 in the morning just wanted to go to bed after a long haul flight reception informed us they never had a room booked my Husband became a little upset they said they would call the Police I tried to calm the Manager down and she said she did not care we had had no sleep we should of slept on the plane after an hour we were allowed breakfast 10 am they decided to give us a room as i had fell asleep on the sofa and more Guests were arriving I would never stay there again I have never met anyone who could be so rude to Guests most of the Staff were the same very poor ruined our Honeymoon 
-4; We stayed here following playing a concert with the band, upon check in the staff were rude and unhelpful, and after travelling for hours and being very tired our rooms were dirty, each of our three rooms had decrepit bathrooms with tiles cracked, broken bath overflows hanging down, mould on all the shower handles, when we complained we were met with rudeness and offered no alternative, but as it was so late we all just went to bed. Breakfast was dire too, scrambled eggs were left so long they had congealed! staff rude AGAIN, none of the staff acted as if they wanted to be there at all and were very dismissive of customers,....and for £139 per room!!!, a Premier Inn would have seemed luxurious at half the price!...following this we stayed at The Hilton on Deansgate in Manchester,...and what a difference, amazing Hotel, amazing staff, amazing rooms,...nothing was too much trouble,...so please Hilton send someone from Manchester down to Leicester and read them the riot act as this hotel is a very very poor reflection on your brand, and for anyone else looking for a place to stay in the Leicester area, ess than a mile away is the Marriott and it makes the Hilton look like a prison. 
-4; Noisy, loud and unfriendly staff. Music on until 1 in the morning. No chance of breakfast as the staff were not let in until half eight. The room was clean and well presented but apart from that it was poorly managed and they need to up their game. At the momoment don't waste your money staying here! 
-4;" We planned and stayed at the Doubletree Hilton hotel in Kensington, London, to be close to some main London attractions that we wanted to show our four year old son (his first trip to the city).  When we arrived at the hotel, the staff were most pleasant and efficient, with us soon booked in and given the keys to our room.  On entering our room (#318), we were quite surprised to find it not only small, but in a poor state requiring re-decoration; lots of repairs to the ceilings, marks on walls, doors, etc. The room wasn’t terribly clean; dust and dirt on surfaces/doors. The air conditioning unit in the room was noisy and rattled away when switched on. There was a mains socket hanging out of the wall by the desk, which unfortunately was at just the right height that would mean our four year old would easily be at significant risk from; we covered it with our bags to prevent him getting access to this.  Immediately outside our room were what appeared to be the main air conditioning units for the hotel. These were running continuously and the noise in the room was considerable, especially as these were immediately outside the room that our young son was to sleep in.  The combination of the noisy air conditioning unit in the room, which vibrated and rattled immediately above our sons bed, as well as the units immediately outside of the room, meant that it was noisy and certainly not restful.  I immediately phoned down to reception to explain the problems and express my dissatisfaction. The receptionist stated that the hotel was full that evening, but we would be moved the following day.  We had a really poor nights sleep; my son awoke lots in the night with the noise of the air conditioning units outside of the room, as well as the rattling noise from the unit in our room. We were all shattered and not in a nice relaxed state for the first of our days in the capital that we had so looked forward to.  The staff that morning confirmed that they were aware of the issues with that particular room! I have no idea why anyone thought it acceptable for us to be put into such a poor room, with the issues already known, especially with a young child. I was assured that a more suitable room would be made available to us and our luggage moved across. I enquired about a larger room, even paying to upgrade if necessary since we were extremely tired and didn’t want to risk ruining another night’s sleep and the activities of the following day. I was assured that the matter was in hand.  We spent the day our at various attractions but returned mid afternoon due to fatigue from the lack of sleep the previous night.  We were given another room (#316). When I queried whether it was simply next door to our first room, I was told that it is, but that it was “much nicer” and wasn’t small like our first room. Again, someone had clearly made the decision to place a family of three into such a small room, with it’s various issues!  Our new room was indeed larger and cleaner. My sons room (living room) was away from the external air conditioning units and was much cooler. However, the main bedroom, which my wife and I slept in, seemed to have either a compressor of high speed pump unit next to it, which cycled through various speeds throughout the night. Another restless night for my wife and I.  On checkout, I confirmed the above details to the lady on reception who apologised and said that she would speak to the supervisor. Returning a few minutes later she informed me that, because I had pre-paid for our stay, there was nothing they could do.  I feel as though we were given an extremely sub-standard, unsafe, unclean and un-suitable room for our first night of our stay. It seemed to me from comments given to us by the receptionist, that they were aware of a number of the issues. Similarly on our second night, we were again disturbed throughout the night due to machinery at the hotel.  This was not acceptable accommodation for our family, was not properly addressed at the time, nor subsequently. This is not taking into account the negative impact this had on our visit to London, which we’d really been looking forward to. This is also not to the standards that I remember of the Hilton chain; is this the standard that is expected of a Doubletree Hilton? I have attempted to get some formal response to these points above (having supplied these details with supporting photos), but to no avail.  Quick to take my money, but not quick to address the issues and redress the issue of an awful stay and a ruined weekend away for the family.  Staff lovely, accommodation (rooms 318 and 316) awful - avoid! "
-4; The staff on the front desk were unhelpful and quite unpleasant. The rooms need a face-lift. The carpets need changing as they have stains on them. They also rip you off with charging for the internet and parking. My advice, seek another hotel. 
-4; I would nor recommend this hotel to anyone  The website is deceiving it is in my opinion only good for a 2 star the rooms are smaller than a dog kennel shabby décor for example toilet tissues stiffed into door hadles to stiffen them up etc  breakfast a joke ran out of sausages etc everyone complaining large hols in the frontage watch your car no bar we had to drink outside  everything that a hotel should not be trust me 
-4;Booked a family break , fri to Monday 8 to 11 feb 2013 we upgraded to silver which is better than standard app , It was awfull broken tiles on bathroom floor on which I cut my toe , not good with two kids under 5 , phoned to complain to get a guy with duct tape to tape up over tiles , there you go enjoy your break !!! The apartment was filthy muck n dirt over skirting and walls marks on bedding tissue under double bed , we come every year but book a caravan we thought we would try a butlins pad but never ever again it would be ok if it was adult weekend but not with kids . Feel very let down ,swimming was good prices are dear food is fast food and awful not for family's
-4; The hotel uses its car park to receive deliveries throughout the night, and as a staff smoking area. Terribly noisy! Please perhaps consider moving deliveries to daytime hours? It's a waking nightmare. 
-4; We are frequent visitors to the White Hart for Dinning predominantly in the Brassiere and consider it to be one of the best places to Dine in the area including Manchester City Centre. The service which is expertly orchestrated by the very professional head waiter only adds to the quality of the food. Thus we decided to plan out wedding venue there and that’s where things started to go wrong. During our first meeting we were given the various options and I have to say they were very accommodating to our minor requests to suit our particular wedding plans. It was even a great surprise and a welcomed one when we were informed that we would not have to pay the usual £370 room rental fee as they also had a much larger wedding on in the main Oak room on the same day. However we should have checked the paperwork as this was not stated and the white hart refused to stand by their verbal offer when later confronted.  We attended our menu tasting event along with my long term friend and business partner and wife and were all very impressed with the standard of the food as it totally fell in-line with exactly what we had grown to expect from our previous experiences there. I should have taken some photo’s of the food !!! Three days before our wedding I was informed that we had 23 guests that had chosen the chicken terrine as a starter and as we had tasted the pork terrine [not the chicken] our choice was the pork terrine or a chicken Caesar salad!! I informed them that it was irrelevant what we tasted we still had the full menu to choose from and has we had chosen a pork dish as a main option we didn’t want the pork terrine as a starter option. They replied by saying sure it’s not a problem we will make the chicken terrine! So what was all the fuss about and the email giving me my two options?? On the Day: Well did the starters look anything like the taster day? NO! Did they taste as good? NO! Not even close, like they were thrown together. My main arrived, the Beef option [and if you have ever had a Sunday Dinner there you will know how good it is!] but it was medium to well not Rare, I informed the waitress it wasn’t Rare only to be told its Rare to medium! So I politely informed her it was Med to Well but I wasn’t going to split hairs it still wasn’t Rare. It was replaced with a Rare piece of tasteless meat and rainwater thin tasteless Jus, not by any stretch of the imagination what your normally get on a Sunday and miles away from the tasting day. The Pork was over done, dry and nothing like the taster day, it was almost inedible with many people leaving it! It is fare to say that I was completely shocked and upset by the unbelievable drop in standards. It was clear that due to the venue being fully open to the public and a much larger wedding on in the main Oak Room they could just not cope. We had both agreed that if something should go amiss on OUR Big Day, we would simply ride over it and deal with it at a later date. This we did, happy to be married to each other and having our family and friends with us couldn’t have made us happier. So when asked [generally] by the staff how our day was going I obviously answered “Great”. This is according to the White Hart proof absolute that I was happy with the meal !!!  The FACT is that both the appearance and taste of the food was far below the normal standard [which we believed we were paying for] and wasn’t even to the standard of a pub chain meal!   They have completely refused to offer any form of recompense for the very poor standard they supplied versus the excellent standards they sold the day on!  Also during the breakfast a table partially collapsed onto the head of a 5 week old baby who was on the lap of her Grandmother. Fortunately a long term friend of mine just out form 26 years service in the Army reacted fast and lifted the table and secured the legs. On arrival of the staff they made accusations to the effect that somebody must have tampered with the table legs!!! They proceeded to lie to the ambulance service saying that a baby had banged its head! They were corrected to the actual events. Upon return to the wedding and fortunately with a healthy baby sporting only a head cut the mother asked to see the accident book. It stated yet again wrongly ‘baby banged head on table’! She demanded that the book be corrected to read table collapsed on babies head. It was clear from the start that their intension was to deflect and possible negative outcome form the incident. My friends in no way intend on taking the matter further however the attitude and actions of the staff were disgusting. Even when furnished with the contact details of the family, they have made no attempt to even enquire as to the wellbeing of the Baby! So if you think of having your wedding there, be aware! Take Photo’s of the tasting menu, read every piece of paperwork with a fine tooth come, do not trust their verbal promises. Do not pay your deposit until you are fully happy with every detail. Do not trust the smiles and reliance on the normal everyday standards which again are very good. And Ask that the head Chef be working as he was not during our day even though they had over 200 people dinning!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
-4; Stayed 15/8/12...What a disappointment. Firstly the room was tiny and stuffy. Tiny window, tiny shower ( I'm sure it wasn't a full sized one ) Mini bar empty, NO tea or coffee in room. Narrow corridors and the place is like a maze trying to find your room for the 1st time. STONE FACED STAFF who were like robots but friendly enough. Ate in the restaurant which was characterless and the food was very over priced. Presentation was good though but left feeling hungry. The steak was as tough as old boots and they only had 3 steak knives ( four of us dining ) . Breakfast at the buffet was a typical runway style, warm over cooked food that had been clearly sitting around for a while. Overall NOT IMPRESSED 
-4;" This is the first Terrible rating i have ever given anywhere. On arrival the hotel looked very presentable and the staff at check in were helpful, friendly, efficient and well organised, Since i did not know the PIN for my business debit card they took payment 'manually'.  The hotel's communal areas were smart, modern and clean, This is where the good news ends i'm afraid. The room was a good size looked fine on the surface but a closer look revealed all sorts of issues, bathroom ventilation was non-existent, carpets that were in need of a good clean, snapped curtain closers and pillows that had seen better days. but the worst problem of all was the bed. The quality of which was beyond belief. there was no spring left in it nor was there any padding and the spring core was so buckled sleeping on corrugated iron sheets would have been more comfortable. at 5 am i had had enough and complained to reception who simply told me that the mattresses were &quot;all the same&quot; At this point i looked online for another nearby hotel but i couldn't actually book one for that night which with hindsight was silly as waking up time was approaching. After a mediocre breakfast i properly complained and was told that a mattress topper would be put on the bed, which was actually just a thin, worn out duvet for our second night. I would have gone elsewhere but i was attending an exhibition in the hotel that ran all day and evening and didn't have time to relocate. The evening event highlighted another problem with this hotel. Over 300 people in attendance and only 3 staff manning the bar. After a long while they opened up another bar but still only had 3 staff on that one. While this doesn't sound too bad only one person on each bar had any idea what to do or where anything was so the service was extremely slow and unprofessional. I think the rest were temps who had never been in a bar before let alone been behind one.I found this quite appalling as there were adverts everywhere about managing weddings for up to 480 people. The following morning the breakfast was quite poor to the point that the bread for the self service toaster was still frozen, the bacon was barely cooked and the sausages were invisible. over the 30 - 40 minutes i was in the restaurant i heard several times, to other customers, that the sausages would be 5 - 10 minutes and up to my leaving they never did arrive. I considered having an evening meal in their restaurant but at almost £20 for an 8 oz rump steak on a menu that didn't even have fillet or sirloin listed i thought better of it and went elsewhere. "
-4;My wife and I stayed at this hotel as part of a coach party in August 2016. Due to circumstances with our coach driver, it took us 14 hours of travelling from Scotland, to arrive at the hotel only minutes after the last diners finished their meals in the dining room.  Our driver had phoned ahead to confirm that we would be assured of a hot meal, but when we arrived the duty manager announced that our meals were indeed ready, pointing to a dish of awful curled sandwiches and a glass of water. On behalf of the seven people from our coach I asked where were our hot dinners we were promised and which we had paid for.  The duty manager said that the kitchen was now closed and that this was all she could do. I suggested to her that all she had to do was to bring out the food untouched from the buffet evening just finished, but she refused, claiming that she was not a chef. I told her that one does not have to be a chef to trolley out some food, or even to heat it up. She then claimed that all the food had been thrown out, immediately after the last diner has left the dining room. When I questioned the veracity of this, she then tried to tell me that she had no access to the kitchen.  This is the first hotel I have ever heard where the manager is not allowed in her kitchen, so I could only dismiss this claim as preposterous drivel. After nearly half an hour of remonstrating with her, she finally offered us some coffee. No, she did not bring this to us, she told us that the coffee station was in the function room, some distance away, and we had to find it for ourselves. I asked her if she had ever seen the Fawlty Towers episode Waldorf Salad, which bore a striking similarity to our situation, and I asked her if she thought things had improved in the forty years since Cleese's brilliant commentary on the appalling attitudes of hotel managers in the 1970s. Clearly the management of this hotel are still stuck in that decade. To make matters worse, the bulk of our fellow coach travellers stayed in the cheaper Heathlands Hotel nearby, also under the Britannia umbrella, and they were greeted with as much hot food as they wished. We were invited to sit and relax to the entertainment, well, that's how SHE described it. I thought we'd walked in on a particularly bad karaoke night, but alas no, it was a male and female act neither of whom could sing a single note in tune. Again, there must be a member of staff at management level who is booking in these appalling acts. What on earth is he or she thinking of?  We left to find food and entertainment outside, and when we returned just after eleven o'clock, we decided to have a night-cap before retiring to our rooms. Unfortunately we were told abruptly that the bar was now closed, and if we wanted a drink then there is a fridge behind the reception where we may purchase a drink!  As paying guests any hotel should provide bar service, even after eleven o'clock, so this is another first for me. When we finally got to our room, after wandering aimlessly through what seemed like a labyrinth of endless corridors with very poor direction signs, we faced another disappointment. Our so-called double room could only be described as little more than a cleaner's cupboard. The windows had frosted glass, so I was intrigued to see what was behind the frosted glass. Lifting up the sash window, and leaning out to the utterly rotten window sill, I was faced with a blank wall. The only consolation was that our room was clean. The hotel does carry an air of faded grandeur sitting elegantly in its prime position, but behind the façade of imperial splendour lost to a by-gone age lies a management who are utterly incompetent, intransigent, in deep denial, and suffering from acute can't-be-bothered-itis. It is little wonder that this hotel suffers from a litany of one star reviews when I witnessed at first hand the appalling attitude of the duty manager, who, with her incompetence, intransigence, and lethargy will ultimately be the ruin of it.
-4; We booked in the June for the annual company Christmas dinner, at this point we did not know what the menu would be, we have been as a group before and the veggie option was okay but this time the Vegetarian option was as bad as it could get. What prompts a chef to offer butternut squash risotto as a vegetarian Christmas dinner ? It did not even resemble Risotto, having the consistency of thick soup with a few artichoke hearts thrown in for good measure, most disappointing and will not repeat next year. The standard of service was not brilliant, the staff mixed up what people on our table wanted and even said that we had not asked for two vegetarian meals. The DJ did not look at the age profile of the audience and all of the music was aimed squarely at the younger generation, he needs to take note that most people got up to dance to the older tunes !  A shame really the venue is lovely and they do decorate the marquee well for Christmas, its just all of the other important parts let it down. 
-4; Made to wait 90 mins for a bar meal ! Ridiculous. When it did finally arrive it was very disappointing...The manager apologised and refunded the cost of the meal , however we left with more than a tinge of disappointment. Not sure I would rate this hotel at all for its gastronomic experience! 
-4;My girlfriend and I decided to book two nights at this hotel, the location was very good which attracted us. Upon check in they ask you for a card and tell you that they put a 'hold' on £50 per nights stay and that it will be released on checkout, now this didn't bother me so much but... Francesco that served us managed to process a payment of £200 out of my account. I asked to speak with the duty manager Ali Anwar. After a conversation with Ali he assured me that the payment would be reversed immediately (still waiting 4 days later). As they had taken a large sum of my spending money I had to get a transfer of funds from a relative to help fund our trip. When we returned to the hotel to check in at 3pm we were met by a long queue as everybody seemed to be there at once. Once checked in we were very tired so decided to have a nap, around 5pm when we were where sleeping another guest CAME INTO OUR ROOM!!! This is totally unacceptable! I got ready and went to reception to find my friend Francesco had been involved in that mistake also! I was assured that it would not happen again and was given a voucher for one free drink! The hotel itself is in a good location and the room was of a good standard but a few staff members have let it down. The duty manager Ali Anwar doesn't have any people skills and didn't seem to show any sympathy towards us and in fact we only got an apology when we had highlighted that they hadn't even apologised! We will certainly NOT go back to any Holiday inn! Avoid at all costs.
-4; Bed is hard. Facilities are old. Breakfast is mediocre. Lobby feels like Liverpool station. Very unhelpful staff and some appear rather arrogant. Guess they do not want to be bothered by customers asking questions. Used the room telephone to ask for assistance on internet but no one answered after several attempts over 30 minutes. Would not recommend. 
-4; Very disappointed with the desk staff in this hotel. They took an imprint of my card the night before which I thought was for drinks etc. The room had been prepaid by my company.. The next morning the receptionist told me that I had to pay in full for the room.I explained that this had already been paid. She accused me more or less of not telling the truth and even though I asked her to check first and not charge my card again she did anyway.  Having paid twice for the room it took countless calls to get the refund.. I think I'm more concerned that the Hilton still tried to charge twice even though my company sent a copy of a bank statement showing that they had taken the money the previous week. Not what I expect from a Hilton and will never stay here again. 
-4;"I had left messages on the reservation voicemail on Saturday and Monday yet they didn't call me back. I called again on Tuesday and finally tracked down the reservations lady. I was told if I wanted a very nice room as part of their &quot;summer break&quot; offer, I would need to confirm by 2pm on Wednesday, I said I would try. They rang at 1pm on Wednesday and I told them I wasn't quite ready and needed more time. I unfortunately was unable to confirm until 5pm on that day(remember they took 1-3 days to call me back). When I called, I was told that it was too late and I had lost the deal. I explained it was really unfair as they had taken so long to return my calls and also it was my wife's birthday, she wouldn't rescind. I asked if the room was still available, for the ensuing Sunday(only 4 days away) and it was still available, I then had a bit of a go saying that service is about helping and pleasing guests, not the contrary and she eventually said I could have the room, rather reluctantly. Her attitude, in spite of the fact she changed, really soured me towards taking the room and I decided not to proceed and booked at another Hotel nearby. When I told her why, instead of trying to make amends and convince me to stay, she merely accepted it and let me go, what is that all about &quot;McDonald Hotels&quot;?"
-4; Visited Butlins Minehead for 4 night stay in a silver self catering apartment for £829 for a family of 4. The apartment was very basic, looked very tired and seemed to have been decorated by Stevie Wonder. So glad we didnt go for the basic acomodation as this looked like downtown Beruit. The whole site looks tired, rusty and old fashioned. Don't be fooled by the glossy adverts on tv! Everything apart from the water park, entertainment and some old fairground rides was an extra cost which was a compete rip off.  The whole place seems set up to get as much money out of you as they can. The staff were nearly all eastern European and most of the families looked like they had been or were going on Jeremy Kyle. The only good points were that my kids still had a good time, the water park was ok and we watched a couple good shows, sbx live and Diversity.  
-4; Drunk party guest outside front of hotel shouting, laughing until 02.30hrs meaning very limited sleep was achieved - also smoking point directly under bedroom windows meaning smell of smoke gets into room -- was trying Village Hotel Solihull as a break from using hotels in NEC area- Will be going back to NEC area for accommodation 
-4; Took my wife with family for her birthday meal. ( her choice). Quite possibly the worst meal experience I've ever had. Food cold - sent back was colder tjan the first attempt. Used to be a car wry which was great but this latest was absolutely rubbish. Streer clear of Sundat lunch. 
-4;The Belfry Hotel and Golf Course what a great venue for our NewYear's Eve break, on arrival the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. The hotel reception and bars, restaurants were all decorated brilliantly, so warm and friendly. We stayed on the 30th and 31st December so we enjoyed the hotel fully (no golf this time), afternoon tea with champagne superb, staff so friendly and made the afternoon memorable. Evening meal in the Ryder Grill again a great idea, buffet or al la carte, for us the buffet, (big tea). Great service lovely room and atmosphere. New Years Eve dinner in the Woodside Suite, again it could not have been better, great table with lovely strangers (albeit only for a while). Food and service first class staff working so hard but still so helpful and friendly - would recommend it to everyone, but don't book for 2017 as we need to make sure there is space for us - we're going back!
-4; Attending as part of a conference they had failed to allocate a room despite the booking being made 6 months earlier. Asked to wait for a few minutes while they got a room ready which in reality was over an hour. Lied to repeatedly while waiting. Would never visit again due to utter incompetence. If I ran my business the same way I would rightfully be bankrupt. 
-4;" Lat weekend I went downfor a hurries breakfast. I asked for coffe and showed where I would be sitting, During a luke warm breakfast on a cold plate, I asked for coffee..............again. When I finished what was then a cold breakfast I made a 3rd request for coffee from the resyaurant manager. I told &quot;He will be round in a minute&quot;. I needed and requested coffee about 15 minutes prior to this!! I ordered coffee from reception and it came in a few minutes. Suggestion, if you have to stay here, try ordering breakfast with coffee before you go to bed......at reception, Useless old fashioned place, "
-4;Oh Dear. Certainly won't be staying here again.  After making it clear when booking I wanted a Twin room and a family room suitable for 2 adults and a 7 and 13 year old. It was disappointing to check in and be given a Double and what turned out to be the small of two types of family room available.   The problem with the double rather than twin was rectified but it took 3 requests before someone came to the room to split the beds and make them up as two singles.  The family room had two small Z beds suitable for young children of possibly 4-5 but not 7 and 13. After some discussion we were moved to a rather tatty family room with a double, single and sofa bed. The mattress on the sofa bed was apauling and you could feel the frame through the very thin mattress. There was also no sign of a duvet or pillows and after a number of requests we were given a very tatty single Duvet for a double Sofa bed.  Included with our booking was afternoon tea for 2. We ordered this upon arrival and received scones that were still partly frozen and a little pot of spray cream :-(. Very poor.  The pool whilst enjoyed by the kids was tatty and dirty and certainly not as nice as the images showed and in need of a good tidy up.  Overall the hotel was tatty and has seen better days, our reservation was completely messed up and service when requesting things was shocking.  We won't be staying here again.
-4; Stayed for one night whilst going to see a concert.  We stayed in room 405 the room was freezing when we entered. We went and asked on numerous occasions at the reception to turn the heating on. After about two hours it actually started to come on. I asked the manager if we could change rooms and he said they are all the same!  It was so cold, I have never stayed in a room that was this cold, it was ridiculous.   When we came back to the room after the concert at midnight, the room was freezing again. We tried to sleep but at 4am decided we had enough and left the hotel at 6am. Heating never came on. At this point we just wanted to go home.   It spoilt our weekend away! Terrible! Avoid! 
-4; If you are missing 1980's East Berlin this is the place to stay. Eastern bloc decor and service. 15 minute wait to check in. Tired rooms. Tiny TV. Clinically cold bathroom. Surly staff at breakfast. Reception staff had a rude efficiency. £200 per night. Never again. 
-4; For our anniversary, I surprised my boyfriend to stay in the luxury suite in the hoar cross hotel. Upon arrival, we was greeted by a very flustered member of staff, who was repeating questions and dragging out the whole checking in process.  Finally, after being pointed in the right direction to our room, we were both shocked and speechless when we opened our door to the 'Luxury Double Room'  The first thing that hit us was the bad smell - it smelt like a musty old peoples home.  The room itself was large - with old tatty furniture, all spaced apart giving a very uncomfortable feeling. There was no way we was going to be able to relax in the room especially after seeing the multiple stains on the lounger and carpet.  Upon further inspection, there were cobwebs on the curtain on top of our head rest, and thick dust on the photo frames.  I rang reception and told them about all of these issues and they said they would transfer us to another room. Upon meeting the duty manager, she took us to one of their 'best suite's' as she said. Entering their 'best suite' was further disappointing. It smelt better but again, looked very old fashioned with tatty furniture, and a very ugly pink coloured bathroom. There was damp that had started to seap through the corners of the wall and my boyfriend noticed the mirror covered in thick dust again. He rang his finger up the side and showed the duty manager to which she replied 'I'm so sorry but I'm not in charge of the house keeping' at this point I was so devastated I just asked for a refund and wanted to leave. Our anniversary was ruined. 
-4; Nice looking hotel, to be fair was also pretty clean - Food was not too bad, however..... I'm not sure I have ever been to a hotel with such poor staff - This includes waiting staff, coffee staff and the bar staff. At one point the main bar must have had over 100 guest in, all drinking and the hotel put one member of staff on - 40 min waiting time for a drink in a hotel that apparently is used to holding a lot of people. Terrible experience. 
-4; The reception staff were most helpful and courteous. This is where the plus points stop. More comfortable beds in a Travelodge! No hot water in the hotel on Sunday morning. If you are thinking of treating yourself and upgrading I'm afraid this is not the hotel for you. No bar snacks (maybe crisps/nuts are to lower class - but at 11 pm you can have a Chicken curry for £15!). Most disappointed after initial good first impressions. 
-4;I have just spent one night at this very tired and outdated hotel.I was not expecting much having read some previous reviews but had been booked in as part of a car tour. The room was clean but looked as if it had been designed in the seventies,it was hot but i did find an electric fan in the wardrobe,bathroom was small with poor lighting by the mirror and a shaver socket at ceiling height !! Corridors were narrow and institutional like.Dinner was terrible in a ghastly room with starters and puddings served by the pleasant staff but you had to queue for your main course at the servery with tired looking dishes under heatlamps. breakfast was equally indifferent.  i was charged £148 for single occupation bed and breakfast which I feel was double what it was worth,Avoid.
-4;Stayed here for a conference. Upon arrival my card would not work and unbeknown to me my identity had been stolen and accounts had been cleared out. I paid cash for the first night as it was late and attended conference the next day. My partner who was in the room received seven telephone calls telling him he had to leave, I found this out at the end of day 1 of conference. As I was unable to get my cards to work I again paid cash and stayed a second night checking out the next morning. Reception staff where rude and unhelpful talking about me in their mother tongue whilst I was stood at reception. The room was hot and air con did not work. I have never been so embarrassed in my life and the customer service was appalling. There are plenty of other Hotels in Bristol and I can only speak as I find. I will ensure we never hold a conference here again.
-4; I booked myself and my fiancée for an overnight stay for Christmas on 28/12/13.We were both looking forward to the get away, we booked in first impressions looked great until we got to the room. handle missing off the chest of drawers, two pieces of trim missing off the bath panel and wall vent not securely fixed (hanging out) then the final joke £3.95 for a bottle of mineral water, where most hotels water is complimentary. When asked by the receptionist about our stay we replied not very satisfactory and she was not at all interested and shoved car park fee back at us and said forget! which we thought was very unprofessional and rude.Leicestershire prices more like London prices. 
-4; Avoid it, if you want sleep or comfort or cleanliness. Rooms were dirty and badly painted. The first room we were offered had dents in the walls and unfinished repairs. The second room had the worlds squeakiest bed with a sheet and duvet that did not fit. Thin walls meant you could hear everyone slamming their doors day and night. Not recommended 
-4;" Hi just to say my name is Wayne Morrison, this is for Emma Bradley from Guest Relations and Selisha (duty manager) purpose. You may want to take a seat this could take a while. Me and my girlfriend stayed at this hotel (using the word hotel loosely) on the night of the 9th July. We booked it last minute through booking.com ( there going to get a review as well). We arrived at about 20.45 and checked in everything was fine , they gave us room 612 and proceeded to our room. We were hungry so went downstairs and had a nice dinner in the bar while watching the football. The dinner was lovely, well recommend the ravioli with goats cheese. Went upto the room after the football and a bit of trouble with the heater but nothing serious anyway I fell a sleep about midnight but my girlfriend works nights so she was still awake till about 2. There we were dreaming away, or maybe I was snoring, all of a sudden it felt like the ceiling was coming through, I jumped up and looked at the clock it was 8.30 and it sounded like somebody upstairs was trying to bang through the ceiling. It lasted a minute or two and then stopped so I thought it was kids playing in their room, anyway me and the girlie went back to sleep and was in dreamworld. Then I heard drilling and looked at the clock it was 9.30 now and couldnt beieve my luck I must have the nosiest room in Gatwick anway it stopped and I thought ok, more sleep, NO WAY the drilling started again at 9.40 so I thought I would phone the reception. A lady answered and I explained about the banging and the drilling and you have guessed it The Sandman Signature had placed me and the girlfriend on the 6th floor and a refurbishment was taking place on the seventh floor. And they must have been in the room directly above us. The lady on the phone tried to apologise and said &quot;have you not had enough sleep&quot; Oh when I checked in I didnt know that I had to tell you how much sleep I need, silly me I must remember that next time. I said &quot; I will sort it out when I check out&quot; I got dressed and went to check the seventh floor to see what they were doing and the whole floor was closed off. We got ready and went to reception to check out, this is where Emma was and I explained that I was not paying for the room due to the noise and disturbance, I explained that if the reception at checking in had explained about a refurbishment on the floor above I would not have stayed in the hotel. Emma said &quot; I can refund £50 but unable to do anymore as the manager was not available until 1 o clock, we paid £82.00 for the room so the room had cost £32.00. I explained I wasnt happy and Emma said she would get the manager to contact me. I left the hotel waiting for the manager to contact me anyway by 1.30 nothing, so I phoned the hotel and asked for the manager and my friend Emma answered I asked her to get the manager to phone me when she was available.  I waited and waited and received an email from my friend Emma and please find the main part attached  &quot; After looking at the situation with my Manager we feel that the £50 deducted from your bill this morning is sufficient based on the rate charged. This was more than half the rate and after deduction was made the hotel room rate stood at £32.00&quot;   Please help me here I stay at the Sandman Hotel and pay for the room until 12 midday but I can only sleep until 8.30 and no one has the decency to tell me this. And for a disturbed sleep you can charge me £32.00.  Im not sure if you can tell but once I received this email I was really annoyed and phoned the hotel to ask for the Manager I got through to a lady called Selisha and explained my situation and you wont believe it she was more interested in what time I left the hotel. Not interested in my complaint, I asked her for the Director of Uk Operations and she gave me the name Kelly Murray I asked could I have her email address and I have heard nothing so funny in my life &quot; I cant give you this I deal with all customer complaints&quot; Ms Selisha I asked for you to call me when you were available but that must have been too much for you, so you got Ms Emma to email me, and try to fob me off with a £50.00 discount.  Just to say I work in a hotel and I cannot believe I have received this level of customer service from a supposedly 4 star hotel, I would be ashamed of this and Ms Kelly Murray if you read this you can keep your £32.00 that your staff seem to think is ok to charge me for half a nights sleep and maybe put it towards some staff training. Please avoid this hotel, communication seems to be big problem. "
-4;I could go on all day about how bad this hotel is.Terrible A la Carte restaurant - the chefs can't even poach an egg. Noisy bedrooms - the windows won't open and shut and sleep is a non event. Poor entertainment, inexperienced (cheap) staff - all in all, terrible.
-4;Despite checking the day prior to my arrival and receiving confirmation that my room was booked and allocated, on arrival my room had been already been reallocated to someone else. I was transferred to another hotel called the Sussex.  The Sussex hotel only had 'single' rooms available. The alternative room provided could best be described as an under stairs broom closet. It was the smallest room I have ever seen. There was an ironing board in the room, however I am sure it was put there as a challenge - how to put it up with no space! The bathroom was slightly larger than a door width, the sink was no bigger than my hand. The noise of other peoples shower water running through the pipework in the roof space was loud and started at 5.30 am. I suppose they had considered the claustrophobic room as the old, single glazed, wooden window in the room opened fully, which would allow you to commit suicide if you were unlucky, or silly, enough to stay in the Hotel for more than a single day.
-4; There were mice running around in the bar and dining area. When I reported to a member of staff he seemed to find it a joke and wasn't concerned at all. I reported it to the lady in reception when I was checking out. She said she would report it to her manager and said thank you for making them aware of the problem. I told her they were already aware of the problem as there were review on trip advisor and booking.com which mentioned the mice (I googled this when I saw them in the bar). The lady then just continued to sort my bill and I left. I won't be returning again !! 
-4; Popped along for a Champagne Christmas Afternoon Tea. It was booked well in advance for 2pm but upon arrival, there were no tables for 'another hour or so'. So instead of the cramped dining room they offered us the lounge.  I accepted and went through to the lounge, which turned out to be a small, deathly-silent, badly-lit room, not out of place in a Funeral Home. They offered me a single chair on a small side-table with a large brass lamp in the middle. I explained there were two of us, and this wasn't a suitable table as their was no room due to the lamp, the waitress shrugged and said we could just pull another chair over later. Weird.  I sat for a while waiting for my girlfriend. and looked around at the other guests who had also been shunted into this room, no-one seemed to be having fun. With this I decided there are scores of hotels, cafés, restaurants that may be more suitable for an afternoon out and got up to leave. Outside I spoke to another guest who was leaving after his tea, and he said I was doing the right thing. Disappointing. 
-4; The George ought to be a lovely hotel. Nice location and an attractive building are good starts, Sadly, abysmal service and a peculiar archaic approach to the wider world mean that it disappoints beyond belief.   The hotel has the most bizarre policy towards guests using laptop computers. Arriving at the hotel I thought I would have some tea and catch up on some emails in one of the public areas. To cut a long story short, an officious duty manager approached me to say that this was not allowed. Apparently, 'our ladies' do not like it. I noted that this referred to the fact that the public area was very busy with extremely loud mature ladies having lunch. It seems a lone person quietly reading emails was all too much for them. I was guided to an unoccupied room to continue my work. the duty manager advised me that they were in the business of saying 'yes' but not to me! The whole experience was extraordinary and frankly very embarrassing. At a fundamental level this hotel is deeply flawed  For people who may wish to stay please note this hotel has a jacket and tie policy for gentlemen in the restaurant, but no dress code for women. For me, this is another 'out of touch' principle that I find adds nothing to the dining experience. Not only do I find this to be out of touch, I also consider it to be very obviously sexist.  For people of a certain age all of this may seem quite quaint - a hark back to a bygone era and if this is what you want from a hotel, then fair enough. However, I cannot help but conclude that the hotel's pompous attitude lets it down and this would be true for many customers. I am by the way a man in my fifties, so I really could be their target audience. My colleague opted to cancel her room - as she observed they really are not in the hospitality industry, nothing was hospitable. A potentially lovely hotel woefully let down by a poor attitude. 
-4;" Stayed in this hotel in November as we needed a place to stay in a convenient location for an overnight trip to London. Booked through a last minute deals website and for the price we paid, the hotel is absolutely fantastic in terms of value and location, as multiple guests have stated elsewhere. As an aside - the &quot;on the door&quot; prices are somewhat hilarious given the fact that this is a (albeit nice) Holiday Inn - I hope tourists don't actually get suckered by this and certainly advise booking ahead!  My issue with this hotel, and the reason for the 1-star rating, is that on checkout we noticed that someone had added breakfast to our bill (which we had not had). The chap at the desk rather dismissively said he would take it off and we left it at that.  I came to check my accounts today and realised I had still been charged (they take card details on arrival). Mistakes happen of course, but on telephoning the hotel, I was told aggressively on the phone that the matter would be investigated and if they could not find evidence of my signature on anything they &quot;have no option but to refund the money.&quot;  Not even the merest hint of an apology, which I find utterly disgraceful bearing in mind that they have completely abused use of my card details and literally stolen money for what I categorically stated I had not had.  Needless to say I will not be coming back. "
-4;" I found it odd that there was no information on the website regarding Christmas or New Year's Eve packages and therefore contacted the venue to enquire. After my second call the brochure was finally emailed but my question unanswered about the cost of upgrading the room and whether entertainment was included in the price.  I was due to go for afternoon tea that week and thought it a good opportunity to ask the question again. The afternoon tea experience did not impress as our table was set for four, correct, but with three chairs and we were situated in the middle of a wedding party! We felt very awkward and I'm sure the wedding party felt the same. I asked if we could be moved to another area which they organised and the food was delicious. However, it soon became apparent that we had been forgotten as we would have liked to have had more tea and the plates taken away. I then walked through the wedding party to reception for assistance.  Upon leaving I asked the receptionist for the answers to our questions about the New Year's Eve package but she pointed out that she had only been with the company three days and needed to refer our enquiry to the Events Manager. I was informed that they were having a meeting about these type of questions in a couple of days, so I left my contact details and was promised a call back. Three days later there was no sign of my call so I chased again. I left my details with the receptionist who said that hopefully the Events Manager would call me back, I stressed that out of courtesy I expected my call to be returned that day.  Upon speaking with the Events Manager, Crystal, I asked why there was no information available online regarding their Christmas packages to which I was told &quot;Laura Ashley look after the site.&quot; I asked what the cost of upgrading the room was and I was put on hold while the calculation was made. My last question was whether entertainment was included in the price. &quot;I'm not sure, I've only been here two months and have never done Christmas here before.&quot; Clearly nobody has but I was surprised that none of these questions had been preempted. I was left feeling frustrated and disappointed with the service and it certainly does not fill me with confidence to make a booking here for Christmas or New Year's Eve. "
-4; Worst experience ever and due to advanced booking lost my money as I had to pay for another hotel for a week. Nothing in the world would make me stay in this hotel. Very rare that a hotel can get everything wrong and it show with the staff as they seem to have given up and don't care any more. Food was appalling and very few staff, so expect a long wait. Room was tiny and not clean. Underside of toilet seat was covered in excrement. Hallway had stains on the carpet and walls. Dining room table was wobbly and sticky. Receptionist unhelpful and lacked empathy. I could go on but too much to list 
-4; Checked in and got sent the wrong way to the room. Room 251 is not sign posted.  Got to the room and there was a huge poo waiting to welcome me in the toilet.  Decided to eat in the restaurant, got ignored by the bar staff, service was poor.  The food was nice although I still find it odd they put fish in my chicken Caesar salad?!  Went to bed and heard banging until I fell asleep around 1am and again at 5am.  I've stayed here quite a few times & never had a problem but can see this hotel is going down hill and I probably won't stay again. 
-4; I wasn't planning on writing this review, but fancied a bit of a moan about the level of service within the bar. My wife, brother and parents stayed around the Excel area for the weekend, and stopped in for a drink. We fancied some cocktails, and when the the waiter/barman came to serve us, he recommended a MaiTai for my wife and mother. They decided to stick to their what they wanted originally (Pina Coladas). However, when another waiter came back with the drinks, he made one Mai Tai and one Pina Colada.  At first, This wasn't a problem as mistakes can happen, but when my wife kindly returned the drink and advised the barman that he had made the wrong drink, he acted annoyed and went on to prepare the worst drink for her with no alcohol. We would have complained further but god knows what else he would have done to the drink. We finished what drinks we had and left.   We would have considered staying in that hotel in our next visit to the docklands, but that service has put me off. I should have taken some photos of the drink he had made.  For £10 a drink, I was expecting more and better service. 
-4; We paid £168 for two seats at a black tie evening awards ceremony and still had to pay £6 to park the car for 5 hours. If we had stayed overnight, the parking charge would have been £12. Disgraceful.  We are both vegetarians so our starter was a few leaves and a piece of tomato, the main course was ravioli in a cream sauce that looked and tasted as if it was from a supermarket. The dessert was a reasonable attempt at an apple tart but with very mediocre wine and slow service, there is no way this meal was worth £84 each  To cap it all, at 11.00pm when it was time to leave with our award, the cloakroom was locked up so it took us 20 minutes to find someone who could retrieve our coats. Ridiculous 
-4; Stayed here on business for 1 night mid-week. Check in was easy and smooth. Was given a room on the 1st floor #109.  However, first thing that I noticed was how big the room was but instead of being pleasant, was an eery feeling of emptiness and very old fashioned. It was as if this was the room that had been forgotton about.  Carpet was worn and rippled. Decor was very old and in need of some TLC. Cupboard doors hanging off. A huge office like light on the ceiling with filler here, there and everywhere. Old heater in the corner and a clump of copper pipes under the desk. Even the telephone was at least 15 years old. 1 or 2 plug sockets in the entire room but had a plastic extension lead attached to them. TV not working neither.  So, I spoke to reception and explained that they had somehow forgotton to show the pictures of this room on their website and instead showed modern ones.. so I was upgraded to a Club Room on the 2nd floor. TV still didnt work (maybe this is an ongoing issues based on other reviews I have seen to), still had an extension lead to use and an old heater in the corner.  To say this cost £150 per night is a disgrace. Complete and utter rip off.. 
-4;" I genuinely regret having to write this report. My wife and I decided to stay at Dunstan Hall purely to support the De Vere Group after they were so brilliant with us after a disaster at Christmas due to the flooding. Having received emails from them regarding short breaks, we chose Norwich as a city to visit over Easter. We booked a suite, Room 437 which is in a nice location but incredible tired and need of a refurb. We could live with that, but what faced us was probably the most disgusting experience We have ever had in a supposedly, &quot;Quality Hotel &quot; anywhere in the World.  My Wife commented on how decrepit the bed looked and pulled the Duvet back to investigate. This revealed a mattress with no Protector or Topper and just a single sheet. To describe the stains that showed through this sheet makes me feel ill just thinking about it ! It was positively disgusting and in that single moment the whole experience was ruined. Having retrieved the Manager from reception the Head of housekeeping was summonsed and the complete bed was dismantled and replaced. In the meantime, we had pointed out that the Bins were still full from the previous occupant's and the whole room felt dirty. After the team had left, they sent up a Bottle of Champagne to apologise, but the feeling of having to sleep in such a room never left us over the 2 nights we stayed. Later on the same day whilst using the Bathroom, I noticed the towel I placed on the floor to step on from the shower was filthy from the film of dirt on the floor. Closer inspection revealed hairs of all description's and another visit to the Manager. This time a gentleman dealt with it and told me he would have to do it himself as there was nobody else available. He then proceeded to write our room number on the back of his hand, adding to an already long list of room numbers he had there already. This is obviously the done thing, as the Manageress of the restaurant was doing the same thing !   We had booked in to the Restaurant for the first night and wished we hadn't ! Cold Soup, Overcooked Lamb and people all around us complaining and receiving complimentary Wine as compensation. The young Waitress however was delightful as was the young Lad serving in the Bar. How the restaurant makes any profit with all the freebies handed out as apologies is beyond me.  Its a shame people don't make an effort to dress for dinner. My wife and I felt completely overdressed (Only talking a Jacket and decent shirt ) which we thought would be the norm in a Country House Hotel ?. We sat and reflected on how such a Beautiful Building with such potential has been allowed to deteriorate so badly and how low standards of cleanliness and quality seemed to be acceptable to the management. Either the groups Senior Managers are not aware or don't care ? Just take a look at the Photos and previous visitor reports and make up your own mind. "
-4; Heading to Dunston Hall for the third time in three years was something to look forward to, however checking in on Friday things felt instantly different.  Instantly I noticed that the hotel is no longer a De Vere hotel, but is now owned by the Q Hotel group therefore gone is the familiar and welcoming feel.  Check in seemed hurried and complicated, we were part of a larger group but checking in separately however this was still messed up by a rather distracted receptionist who handed us the wrong keys and details.  One thing I did notice was the price was lower than expected and we were also handed some ‘free drink’ vouchers. Nothing to explain why, however we subsequently found out that the pool and spa area were out of action due to renovations. Nothing was mentioned at check in about this at all but the fact that Dunston Hall promotes itself as a ‘Spa break’ hotel should mean that this was clear to everyone who booked. It felt like the staff didn’t know what to say on the subject and the whole thing further decreased the enjoyment levels on our weekend.  On entering the room I instantly noticed nothing had changed. The rooms were in exactly the same state as when I last checked out two years ago, except for obvious wear and tear, lightbulbs out and the removal of the minibar/fridge. No improvements anywhere, in fact quite disappointing. The bathroom was the same, ours in particular had a dribble of a shower with only luke warm water.  Finally I feel I must mention the staff at our Saturday evening gala dinner. While the bar staff were fantastic in dealing with an enthusiastic crowd of over 250 people those waiting on the tables were less organised. I understand it must be hard to motivate staff for these jobs, however I personally witnessed someone be billed with gravy and another have potatoes dropped on them, neither incident was dealt with in a professional manner and that’s disappointing.  If I could make a suggestion to anyone reading this review it would be to not book this hotel but to book in at Sprowston Manor slightly to the north of Norwich as this hotel has never let us down and is better in every way when comparing it to Dunston Hall.  A real disappointment of a weekend. 
-4; Upon visiting the beautiful Cotswolds, my girlfriend and I stopped at the the Golden Pheasant for lunch and a couple of drinks. It was my Birthday and Valentines day and from the outside it looks like a lovely restaurant. We however had the misfortune of being served by a very rude gentleman.. we therefore finished our drinks and decided not to stay for lunch! It was also a very peculiar atmosphere in the restaurant for a Sunday lunch time.. rather dull! And it seems the atmosphere had rubbed off on this staff member who was miserable and very rude. 
-4; I stayed here two nights on business, and nowhere in the booking I made was it advertised that my single room would have no bathroom. Apparently this was shared with one other person, but there were at least 3 people using it, menaing a couple of times in the morning and at night I had to queue to use it - really not what I wanted.   Other negative points about the room:  - Far too hot, meaning the aircon had to be constantly switched on.  - TV remote did not work - Some old plaster wrappings were in the bedside draw, so this place is not cleaned particularly well. - Room had teabags and coffee, BUT NO KETTLE! I actually played a game of 'hunt the kettle', going through every drawer and cupboard, as I couldn't believe one wasn't supplied! -   I stay in a lot of hotels around the Victoria/Pimlico area, and even the grottiest, shabbiest ones will have an ensuite bathroom. At £117 a night, this hotel is hugely overpriced in comparison to some of its competition, and the illusion give nin the lobby that this place is posh couldn't be further from the truth.   I would advise all budget-conscious travellers staying in this area to look at the excellent Z Hotel around the corner, or even the Comfort Inn, where you at least get what you pay for. 
-4; After a long drive the last thing you want is to be judged as you arrive at reception as if I didn't meet the criteria to stay at there hotel. The staff didn't know what was available and being sent to wrong part of the dining room to eat to be ushered to another part. When food was ordered it never arrived so after half an hour I go looking to be told it was taken to my room and it will be with me shortly but after it had been freshened up. No idea how as the kitchen had know closed..... The staff just fobbed me off and the chap who took my order just shrugged his shoulders. Do not stay at this hotel its overpriced and not worth your time 
-4;" I have registered with tripadvisor simply because of this hotel. Everything I will mention is the truth and unbiased completely. I stay in Gatwick on a regular basis but this is the first time I have stayed in the Copthorne London Gatwick although I have stayed at their sister hotel Copthorne Effingham. The first thing I noticed was the the car parking fee which is £5 per night but if you stay at their sis hotel 3 miles down the round they don't charge anything. The place looks nice as you walk in reception and also the grounds look nice outside. So I check in and I am told it is £5 per 24hrs for wifi which in this day and age I find a disgraceful charge for any hotel; I only pay that a month at home. For the majority of rooms be prepared to walk some distance to find it. I was carrying a heavy holdall and was shattered by the time I got to my room there was not a bell hop in sight. I went out to eat in their White Swan bar where they serve bar snacks and have sports on. They also have an a la carte restaurant but all the food is cooked in the same kitchen. I ordered the chilli con carne which was £12 now this is where the problems start. First off £12 for a chilli is a rip off wherever you eat it but when you look at the prices of some of the other items on the menu it looked the safest option. Now I waited 30 minutes for it to come, when it arrived it was a portion that wouldn't fill my 3 year old nephew and as I tucked into it i found it was frozen in the middle,disgusting! This is from a kitchen that claims to do a la carte, I'm no chef but even I wouldn't serve up frozen chilli. So I sent it back and they apologised and said they would bring me a new one. They didn't they just brought my old one after zapping it in a microwave, I was so hungry by this point I couldn't be bothered complaining. Now my next problem was most people complain about having no hot water, well I was the opposite I had no cold water in my room. They sent somebody out to have a look but he just said he didn't know what was wrong with it.   All in all this was a terrible stay this is a hotel that charges 5 star prices and delivers 2 star services and I will stay clear of the Copthorne group of hotels in future. I know this review makes me sound like a serial complainer but I'm really not I was just so bitterly disappoint and left feeling that I had been fleeced. "
-4; A friend and I visited here for a spa day in July. It was a disaster before it had even begun, and it didn't improve.  I telephoned to make a booking, the central reservation line went to voicemail and asked me to leave a name and number for a callback. Over the following week I left my name and number, at various times of the day, over 20 times. Noone ever called me back. I emailed Marriott to complain and eventually got a call back. I booked my spa day for several weeks in the future as it was the only day that myself and my friend could get treatments at the same time, at a time of day that suited us.   A bit like busses, a couple of days later I received another call back. I explained that I had already booked and confirmed my booking details with the lady on the phone.  We arrived at the spa on our booked day only to discover that we didn't have a booking. They finally found us on the system, booked into a different week, with different treatment times than we had chosen! There was a general lack of interest from the staff, who were quick to blame us for the mix up (despite me now reading on here that this seems to happen a lot). They did however say they could fit us in that day, which was just as well as we'd had to arrange childcare to attend this day. We were told that we wouldn't be able to have treatments at the same time as there was no availability. We had no choice but to accept this but we were clear about our disappointment. I was given a card and asked to give feedback about my experiences. On return home I called the number. Left details of my complaint and was told I would get a callback within 3 days. That was a week ago.....  We we shown through to the 'relaxation' room as the first treatment slot we had been offered was only 20 minutes away. It all felt very rushed and not at all relaxing.   The supervisor came though to say she had managed to change some things around to get us both treatments at the same time a little later in the day and this was most appreciated. We were ready to relax.   We were given the option to rent robes and slippers for £5 (something that has been free at every other spa day I have ever been on). We paid this, but only received robes as they were all out of slippers!   We were also charged an additional £10 each for lunch. Which was from a disappointingly limited menu. Lunch was OK. But if I were to have my time again I would have ordered from the much more extensive menu at the restaurant (something we didn't realise was an option when we paid for lunch).   As for the spa itself, I think 'spa' is a bit generous. It's basically a hotel gym and pool that is cashing in on spa days. The 'relaxation' room is a couple of chairs in an alcove with tea and coffee facilities (though you have to go to reception to get a mug!). The changing rooms are tired, the steam room was out of order and the 'spa' area of the pool is just some sunbeds and a jacuzzi from where you can watch and listen to the hundreds of children splashing around in the pool (which is partially closed for some of the day for children's lessons).   On the plus side, the gym is good and the treatments we received (back next and shoulder massage for me, and mini manicure for my Friend) were delightful.   We left, if not relaxed, then at least happy that we'd had a day out!   Would I recommend it? No I wouldn't. There are many many spa day packages available in this area, and most of them offer a much better day for your money.      
-4; VERY misleading to say the least, not at all what we were expecting . You approach the beautiful Eastwood Hall ( YOU DO NOT STAY THERE ) you take a short drive past there to a car park then straight to reception, the place you actually stay is alongside the hall, this is more like a dated old retirement home !! This needs to be shown on your website ..would not have booked if we saw this first .  Checked in with our groupon voucher, pleasant staff easy check in . On the way to our room was rows of dated old looking sofas in long corridors, not at all inviting.   The room was dated, double bed was more like a large single, only one cup on the tea tray. Went straight down to the bar we ordered a pint of lager £5 ..the cheapest bottle of wine on the wine list was a staggering £23.50 spanish, at the local supermarket i would not pay £3.00 for, the new zealand sauvignon blanc we usual drink was £33.00 a bottle Absolute joke .. If my husband hadn't have drank the pint of larger we would have left there and then ..  Finished these then went back to the room to change for dinner, the iron didn't work rang about 15 times to reception then housekeeping no reply from either. The only good thing i have to say about this place was the breakfast this was outstanding and the beautiful grounds .No we would not recommend or stay again ..cheap budget place sorry cant even call a hotel.. 
-4;Dinner, Bed and Breakfast very poor value. poor customer service. reception more interested in signing you up to Hilton Rewards than advising what you had paid for. supplements for certain dishes higher on restaurant menu than shown online Would not go back or recommend
-4;Two days of niggles and annoyances saw e checking out a day early. The hotel was understaffed with waits of thirty minutes or more in the restaurant the norm. Every meal served was at best luke warm even the breakfast which had been laid out seconds before I served myself had arrived on the buffet cold. The Christmas dinner which should have been the feature meal of the stay was truly abysmal and a disgrace. This is a decent enough facility that is badly let down by the food and beverage side. The only good thing I can say is that the reception team were, without exception, noteworthy for their professionalism and attitude.
-4; I was supposed to attend a business meeting here but when I got to the hotel I found myself confronted with an entry controlled parking area and a notice which indicated that I would be facing a parking free of over twenty pounds. As an OAP there was no way I could pay that, so turned round and drove home. A totally wasted trip. So be warned if you are planning to meet someone at this hotel you are facing very high parking fees. 
-4; Extremely old. Everything around (carpet, furniture, bed, etc.) is amortised. Last revamp seem to happen 30 years ago. Toilet not working. Can hear voices from neighbour rooms. Wouldn't pay even £50 for this room. 
-4;"The hotel is centrally located and offers parking on a first come first served basis. First impressions as we walked in were as other Hotel du Vin places that we had visited. Check-in was quick and easy. We stayed in a studio room but was allocated one (Robert Mondavi) which was on the 1st floor near the lift and service lift. As people passed the room it sounded like they were actually in the room itself. Walls appeared paper-thin and offered little privacy.   The room hadn't been cleaned properly. Bathroom wall opposite the toilet was dirty (not what you'd expect from a hotel charging &gt; £250 a night) and artefacts from previous occupants were left behind and not cleaned away. Generally the room looked tired and in need of decorating - grouting in the shower covered in mildew and bathroom walls grimy. The doors leading out to the terrace outside didn't close and lock properly.   It's our last visit to a Hotel du Vin and we'll definitely look elsewhere in future."
-4; Appalling.....to start with there was no parking left by 7.30pm. 11 people were seated on a table that would have comfortably seated 8. The complimentary prosecco ran out before half the people arrived and a colleague said it was watered down.....the food was okay at best, but the vegetarian option had the tomato soup poured over a mushroom pie (described as a Wellington). Even the tea and coffee served afterwards which we had to help ourselves to from an urn was cold and stewing and not replenished. Too many people crammed into a room and at £45 a head I expected better.......and not one Xmas decoration in the dining room....no repeat business from us and we are NHS workers. Terrible. 
-4; Stayed here last year back end Woke up in middle of the night by alarm No apologies Room was not ready till late in the afternoon Throughout the next day no apology given in fact contrary to that rudeness Have stayed there before and it was perfect Was promised on checkout that a manager would write and invite us back That never happened I called once but nothing was done Before the hotel ( although very expensive) was worth every penny) now upon reflection I do not believe that to have been the case as I have may have been seeing it through rose tinted glasses  Sausages were raw at breakfast No apology again  It seems that the higher star you go and more expensive you pay does not give you the service  My daughter are the sausage was fine in the end but felt rough all day  The least they could have done was to respond 
-4; Hotel room, i had pre paid for , had a water leak, heavy mould on two walls and sim ply was not clean. There was load noises from puumbing all night , THE TV was broken and didnt work, and there WAS NO HOT WATER in the mornuing tio have a shower.   When i complained, the hotel staff said many TVs didn't work, and hot water like the transport is on a firest come basis.   After asking for 2 days extra paking , they billed my card 140UK saying afcter i left there was an issue with my booking   IWOULD STRONGLY ADVISE AVOIDING THIS 'HOTEL'  Thjese guys are a disaster. I have stayed in 40plus hotels in many differing regions of the world, in 2015 , and this is the WORST HOTEL i have stayed in. You can get better in rural india or afria - and i am quite serious   In smmary AVOID , AVOID,. AVOID AVOID !!!!! 
-4;We booked this hotel as we had arranged to meet friends in London to see a show and catch up. Our Friends had booked this hotel so we decided to stay there as well. We found it expensive at £209 a night for a double room but justified it as we felt it better to saty in the same place to maximise the time with our friends. While at first sight it is an airy clean environment when you look closely it is quite oridinary and not of a high quality for the price you are paying. We found out on check in that the £209 did not include breakfast so you are literally just paying that for a bed!! We expected bed and breakfast at that price. Our friends paid the same rate and they had breakfast included. We were told we would have to upgrade if we wanted breakfast which was an awful lot more in price and not worth it. The staff couldn't care less that we were unhappy and did nothing to try and make up for our disappointment. The room was clean but nothing extraordinary and had very cheap quality tea and coffe facilities with not even a biscuit just cheap tea and coffe sachets. (remmeber this was £209/night) then when we used the sink in the bathroom it was blocked!!!! it just got worse. Very difficult to control the room temperature system as well and we were far too hot all night. The bed was ok but the pillows were awful. We slept really badly. When we got back to the hotel in the evning we went to the bar for a drink and the prices were unbelievable. It cost £12.50 for a glass of wine!!! I felt the whole experience at this hotel was not about you the guest having a comfortable and happy stay, they couldn't care less about you, it is purely to squeeze as much money as they can out of you which left us feeling miserable and took all the pleasure from what should have been a lovely weekend with friends. I will never stay in another Hilton hotel again on principle as I feel I have just been completely ripped off. I have stayed in premier Inns and found them to be 100% better from room quality to service and price. I am the kind of person who will pay for quality as I feel you get what you pay for, this was just one big rip off!!! avoid at all cost!!!!!
-4; The Hotel is very dated rooms are very hot and could do with air conditioning but all this could be forgiven if the bar staff and kitchen staff could get their customer service right on Saturday 30th July they managed to get drinks order wrong on two occasions food when arrived after an hour of ordering was poor and came out in stages eg main course with chips wad main course then 15 mins later the chips arrived it reminded me of Fawty Towers not impressive 
-4; We have stayed at this Marriott on several occasions as our son is studying at Durham university, up until this latest visit we have been fairly pleased with the hotel ( although I would agree with previous comments re having to pay for wifi use in the bedrooms). When we stayed in February we were allocated a tiny room with the most uncomfortable bed ever, I would have assumed that the mattresses have to be checked and changed regularly but I'd be very surprised if that one had passed an inspection. The other issue was the shower, the bathroom had a shower over the bath but the shower had no pressure at all. It really was very disappointing and I think for my next visit I'll look at the Raddisson Blu instead.  Patsy JF 
-4;"I thought it would be quite nice to book an overnight stay for my girlfriends birthday. The deal I found included a 3 course meal and a massage with breakfast the following day. We were informed through the booking that check in would be from 2pm, and the massages were preferable to pre-book to confirm the time of appointments.  My first port of call was to organises the massages. I rang no less than 3 times to be told they were busy but would call us back. Upon my final attempt to speak with the spa, they said dont worry as there would be space for us. Stupidly, I believed them.  We arrived at the hotel for the receptionist to have no record of us and that booking through 3rd party organisers was always a nightmare. I wasnt sure whether he wanted us to apolohise for that fact. We were then told a room wasnt ready and that we needed to come back at 3pm.  To add further to my fury, he then informed us we could only have one massage that day, After speaking with a manager, he offered us a 2 different slots for that day or to have our massage at the same time we would need to wait around until the following day. We then had to wait until mid-day the following day.  The facilities;  The swimming pool is okay, but children were in the pool and not exactly relaxing to be around. In the spa itself my girl friend cit her leg, as there are large amounts of tiles missing from the seats in the steam rooms. As there were jagged edges she didnt check and scratched her leg as she moved. (you can now imagine I wasnt exactly enjoying my stay).  The restaurant;  We had been told to compensate for our unacceptable service we would receive a complimentary bottle of wine. We had to ask for that in the restaurant as no wine was offered. The food was nice (one gripe as they have no black peppercorn or diane sauce with a steak). I think the restaurant must be understaffed as no-one came back to offer dessert or give us the bill. We decided to take a bottle of wine to bed instead as we couldnt get any service.  Breakfast was the same standard, Food was nice, but no one came to offer tea or toast. by the time we actually managed to get someone we had finished our food.  Finally our massage was nice, but the 'relaxation room' was cluttered with dirty glasses both on the table and the floor next to our chairs.  In truth, if there was any management presence to organise this facility it would be potentially a nice stay, but I definetly dont think it was a worth while £250 spent.  Good luck!"
-4; I checked in, room fine etc. but boy oh boy avoid drinks in this hotel. Even by West End prices £12 for the smallest glass of port I've ever seen is laughable. Indignation at the price is added to by the woeful service at the bar, the guys wouldn't last two mins in an Irish bar! Far far to slow. So if you are planning a night in, go out! 
-4; We have stayed at the Sandbanks Hotel lots of times. Our children have always really loved the 'Funsters' kids entertainment team. However, on our latest visit we discovered that the hotel has replaced the Funsters with their own in house kids entertainment team. They were nowhere near as good. They had no real control over the children and the entertainment was repetitive and unstructured. Very disappointing. Won't be going back unless they get the Funsters back again. 
-4; I used the hotel own website to book the room for one night including breakfast. Checked in late 22nd July (1.30am 23rd). Breakfast 8.30am waiter says breakfast not paid for (unfriendly look on face). I say wrong it is paid for and found a table to sit down. Few minutes later tall aggressive lady approaches and repeats that I have not paid for my breakfast. Room half-full about 20 people now looking on with interest. I repeat it is paid for and lady (who did not introduce herself) walks sullenly away to regroup. 10 minutes later same lady approaches again and demands proof of payment. I say to wait until after breakfast and she slopes off once more to even more interest from onlookers. Embarrassing but after breakfast I make the trip to the room for the receipt (which luckily I still have) and show it to the sullen lady with no name. No apology just copied and returned. I ask to see the manager. I wait for 5 minutes when a gentleman in black suit approaches. He does not introduce himself but asks if he can help. I explain and without further ado he retires in the back office. He does not give me time to explain I cannot hang about as my airport bus is waiting. So I leave my telephone number with reception and ask that they call me to apologise and make a compensation offer for the embarrassment they have caused. 3 days later I call back to collect my car and call at reception. They claim the manager with no name tried to telephone me about the problem without success. This was not true. I left my telephone number once more. Again no-one bothered to call. Not one to give up easily I emailed the hotel on 29th July. No response. Emailed again on 31st July. Finally a staff member with a name (hurrah!) James Smith offered a room upgrade on my next visit. I felt that humiliation in front of a dining room of breakfast guests was worth rather more and suggsted £100 or a one night free stay at the adjacent Copthorne Copthorne (which is a really excellent hotel and must not be confused with the dreadful Copthorne Effingham). I rejected his offer. Not much wrong with the hotel or the food - but the staff!! Ugh!! Mind you anyone employed by people like James Smith may well end up with a moronic mind. Until this hotel gets professional senior management KEEP AWAY. 
-4; Staff are the worst i have come across  Hotel is in an industrial est / room average at best but cost 5 star money with a view of a truck  Food expensive and uwfull quality sttil feeling ill now   I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND WOULD OTHERS TO THINK TWICE 
-4; The H10 London is not worthy of 4 stars, I would give it 3 at the very most. The room was small, cold, uninviting and the floor did not have a carpet.The basin in the bathroom was chipped and the towels were like sandpaper. this hotel is nothing like as good as the other holtels in the Westminster Bridge Road/Waterloo area, it is a very poor quality hotel in a very rough area, I will never use it again. 
-4; Before I criticise this hotel, I first have to admit that the grounds are gorgeous and the building itself is impressive. However, this is not enough. Here's a list of some of the things that bothered me:   About the hotel   The furnishings were in dire need of refurbishment. All of the carpets were faded. Most of the lampshades were slightly crooked. It looks like it was last refurbished in the early 1980s. If you’ve seen Grand Budapest Hotel you’ll have a good idea of what to expect. It’s a hotel that would have been fantastic a few decades ago but now is just very tired and worn out.  The snooker room had dents on the walls, bent queues, chipped balls, etc.  In our ensuite bathroom, the shower tap came off in my hand. Instead of a nice door, the shower had a musty old curtain.  In our room, the carpet was very ripped in one corner. One pane of the window had been smashed and fixed up using sellotape. The TV didn’t work properly.  The sound of the staircase from the hallway was pretty loud - we were woken early by other guests going down for breakfast.  About the food and drinks   Snobby Staff and attitude: the couple in front of us were turned away from eating at the restaurant because the man was not wearing a jacket. It was distressing for them and for us to have to watch.   Slow service: even though the place seemed to be packed with staff, it was hard to get their attention.   Poor drinks: we went to the cocktail bar and I ordered a bloody mary, which is a very easy cocktail to make. The barman who took my order barely spoke english and took about 10 minutes to bring my drink. When it came, it was just vodka mixed very watery tomato juice with lots of ice. His english was so poor it was hard to explain to him what he had done wrong. You expect better from an actual cocktail bar with prices around £10 a drink.   Poor breakfast: overcooked scrambled eggs, poor quality sausages, chewy, fatty bacon etc.    About the country club   A female cleaner came into the men’s changing room three times while I was there (over a 48 hr period). One time while I was was not wearing any clothes. I can’t imagine why they have a female cleaner working in the men’s changing rooms   Masseuse wouldn’t stop talking: I asked for a hard swedish massage, she was obviously tired at the end of her shift and made a half-hearted effort. She also wouldn’t stop chatting, so it wasn’t a relaxing experience. 
-4; My worst night in a UK hotel and possibly the worst ever bar one night in Rumania just after the revolution. They did not warn us that a wedding party had booked in. Returning that evening to run the gauntlet of smoking, drunken and obstructive guests at the door, it got worse from then on. Pounding music until the early hours penetrated the paper-thin walls. Loud and obscene arguments in the corridor outside (and a maid scrubbing away the vomit in the morning) culminating in a fire alarm at 6.30 am. That last was brushed aside by the man on the desk as we checked out as if there was a perfectly reasonable wake-up call for a Sunday morning. 'It was someone smoking in their room,' he said. Probably someone setting light to their partner's hair if the rest of the behaviour we saw was anything to go by. I left a long and detailed account with the staff and was promised a response from the manager. I have heard nothing since. My advice? Only consider staying mid-week. Check there isn't a mid-week wedding (I see this has all happened before) and even then, stay somewhere else. I hear the Holiday Inn is just fine. If you do go there, try eating at Chez Jerome just down the road - that was the only good part of our stay. 
-4;" This review is solely about the restaurant at the New Ellington which is a franchise colocated with the main hotel and does not reflect the quite proper service of the hotel's duty manager. When we arrived our reservation was not recognised, despite our having a voicemail confirmation. We had to wait over 20 minutes for Alex the restaurant manager to see us despite two attempts by the hotel duty manager to get him to see us. It was clear from his demeanour when he arrived that he had no interest in trying to resolve the reservation problem. He was quite aggressive and said he had sent text messages but couldn't get his phone (he was too busy) to confirm. He could not have cared less for his customers and on that showing does not deserve business of any kind. We will certainly not return to try the &quot;Ellington experience&quot; as our treatment was appalling. "
-4;Very disappointing. Was supposed to be in oak room but placed in small bar area on our own with no view of Xmas tree and entertainers obscured by waiters! Very poor customer service by Nathan who was extremely disinterested. Obviously they had overbooked and hoped no one would complain. I have complained to duty manager and will be interested in response which will post here. Advertised as getting into Christmas spirit but this has left me very wary of booking anything at this hotel again and one disappointed wife and mother in law . Hotel looks great but would put the level of service as probably the worst I have ever come across with very shoddy treatment. I spent 3 x £36 total 108 for 2 hour afternoon tea so probably not high on their agenda of high paying customers
-4; One of our party had a bad meal management insisted it was norovirus ,told us better if we left as we could infect other guests . When we made complaint they denied everything , customers liaisons chose not to believe us, and we were made to feel that we were lying 
-4; Rude reception staff, bar staff non existant or when you do track one down they take 20mins to bring a coffee and they dont come back to see if you'd like another drink, even if you are the only people in there. Room average, needs updating as a bit tired looking, great feature room if kept in better order, bathroom not up to standard, there were marks on the towels and a long hair in the sink. Food fantastic shame the restaurant looks so old fashioned and not in a good way. Grounds lovely altough its a shame there's no flower beds would be nice to have some colour All in all it's ok but there are much better traditional hotels and amazing modern hotels near by Oatlands needs a big overhaul, no swimming pool or spa which is a shame. 
-4;" Ive just stayed at Moonfleet Manor and this will be the first time ive had to write a review, as so far ive been very lucky in the places ive stayed.Its advertised as part of a bespoke&quot;luxury hotel chain&quot;,it truly isn't.Its more like Fawlty Towers.The rooms are shabby the Leisure facilities (pool especially)were disgraceful.All the flooring on the pool was coming up and some of the windows had no glass in them just some nailed plywood!The whole hotel needs a complete refurbishment.If you are spending these sort of prices you want good accommodation good food.Unfortubately this Hotel doesn't get there on this. "
-4; went to the woolpack following its renovation, what a disappointment, the old comfy bar area has gone and replaced by a soul less space. The food was terrible, greasy battered fish and tasteless chicken that was more likely to have seen a microwave than an oven, staff didn't seam that fussed. Managed to ruin a good pub. 
-4; I have been using this hotel since I held my wedding reception there in 2004 , at least twice a week , so I would class myself as a loyal customer however no longer . In the last two week I have experienced terrible service which included a visit with a friend for morning coffee. Sat for 20 minutes in the lounge and was totally ignored by team members. To busy chatting and laughing. In the end I had to go up to main bar and ask was anyone serving, a team member then came over and took our order. 10 minutes later two coffees arrive, one split all over the table, no offer was made to wipe it up. The other part of the order never arrived so we went and helped ourselves to the Danish pastries.  After coffee we went to pay the bill and presented the Grand loyalty card, the staff member said sorry I can’t take that as I’m not a manager, attempt was made to find one, so we left. Thinking that every place can have an off day I returned Thursday night, with a friend to have drinks and a snack. As always my small dog was with us as on EVERY visit I make there. The staff got a bowl of water and biscuits for the dog as normal, Great service, then a staff member came across and asked us to leave ,this has been requested by the owner Mr Richardson... as dogs are not allowed in the Grand ...  Mr Richardson was sat in the bar but would not come across and talk to me in person. I got up, paid, handed back my loyalty card and left, on the way in I saw a lady who was not a guest coming in with two dogs and nothing was said. I asked the staff member to give my loyalty card back to Mr Richardson personally. As a loyal customer who has always supported the hotel, I feel this treatment was terrible. If the dog had been out of control then of cause you would have had the right to ask me to leave or do something with the dog, are you going to do something about the out of control children... I think not. Such a pity, a warning to other dog owners , don’t visit as you will be asked to leave. 
-4;" Led to book here by a completely misleading pic of an old house on lastminute.com. This small and not very dutifully maintained building is away from the main (1970s conference centre-style) hotel and not even the reception rooms are part of the hotel itself. In two days no sign of any management at all, just a group of (in fairness) cheery young people who seemed entirely untrained. They seem very keen for you not to use their restaurant (&quot;It will be very busy in the evening&quot;, they suggest in a note in your room that you may have to wait 15 mins if you want to have breakfast there and they don't answer the phone if you ring for room service). Charmless and cheerless with a car park that felt about a quarter of a mile from the reception which itself felt about a quarter of a mile from the room. "
-4; Room fairly bland, cleanliness of room and shower room debatable and no hot water from 6.00pm onwards meaning taking cold showers does not warrant the £125 a night price tag. This coupled with one particular gentleman on the front of house staff of reception being ignorant and rude made my wife's birthday remember able for all the wrong reasons. I have stopped at many hotels and many varying standards but pound for pound this ranks as one the worst hotels I have stayed in. If you want to stay in a hotel in the mailbox in Birmingham I would recommend the Malmaisson, it's cheaper and in a different class. If the tariff was half of the price of whats being charged then that's about the right level.   
-4; Booked here for two nights through work. First impression was not good with the very dark and confusing car park at the rear of the hotel.  Check in was swift and efficient.  The room was awful though. Very tired, and noisy being a sea view room next to the road. The bathroom was small with broken tiles and black mould in the shower.  I moved rooms.  The second was much better being away from the road with a bathroom without mould.  Overall, I think this hotel has had a glorious past but is now tired and dated. 
-4;I was there on a business trip for the shooting with one of the broadcasters. My room was close to the front desk, and the fire doors were banging all night whenever someone walked through!  I had no sleep at all. The hotel staffs were not helpful at all in this situation.
-4; Well what can I say. Just over a year ago I gave this hotel a glowing 5 star review but that's all changed after my latest experience.  It's a long story which ends with the hotel over-charging me £400 incorrectly and I am still trying to get this resolved weeks later. So be warned, it's a great place to stay until something goes wrong and then no accountability is taken to resolve an issue. The staff and service have also gone down hill rapidly and as very high cost 4 star hotel it's value for money is not so good anymore.  The only good thing about my stay this time was the location of the hotel. It has gone down hill every other way in my estimations and I'll finally be using the rest of my Hilton Honors points and staying with a different hotel group in future.  Email for more details of exactly what went down. 
-4; We have recently visited and stayed in a tiny double room with the smallest ensuite possible. The room was very tired and the shower door was broken as well as shower head. Breakfast was reasonable. The hotel was definately not a four star hotel and we paid £80 for one night(so not cheap). The decor as well as hallways looked like they had been the same for years. The room had a smell of blocked drains - it was disgusting and on reading reviews after our stay they have had complaints previously. Duty manager on reception was not terribly welcoming and wanted us to wait one and a half hours after booking in time for room to be ready. Breakfast staff were friendly. We are definately not returning. 
-4;" Now lets begin, first of all lets place aside most of the positive comments on this site which are most likely written by the hotel management themselves.  I am a fair and easygoing person but there is a limit to everything. Initially I book on the website as a very good looking room/hotel with all the needs anyone could need,clean with breakfast and just what I was looking for as we are a family 5.  We walk towards the hotel where we were lucky to get there alive at night, anyway I arrive in the hotel and find myself in a ruined, dirty and badly maintained reception if we can call it that way where they tell us that we can not check in that it was too early. Fine there is no problem !  Later on we come back where the receptionist tells us that our room is in the &quot;BASEMENT&quot; yes BASEMENT !! we go downstair down these old ruined hallway where lies a our rooms door ironically named &quot;suite &quot; just beside the bathroom. we enter this room, completely dark, with a smell of sewage dispersed everywhere in the room.  This is the scene. a window is not closed but bricked and cemented as we are in a basement while the other is about 80 cm from a wall in a hole under a sidewalk. a corner where a sink and a microwave was shoved in which they called &quot;kitchen&quot; and a bathroom which I would rather not describe.  Beds had hair on them, dirty , and stained, floor that had a carpet at least 40 years old where it was discussing even to walk on.  This room was inhumane for any living person.  We go upstairs and to our surprise they inform us about more good news which they had smartly hidden on their website. that breakfast was only available to be eaten in the rooms as the breakfast room was under renovation. so a family of 5 would have to squash in and eat in an underground room of those conditions first thing in the morning when they payed 400 pounds ?  What I am saying is that I am perfectly fine if you want to run a hotel with filthy rooms, bricked windows in an underground but you have to let me know what I am paying for and not making me pay 400 pounds for 2 nights while I think I booked something else.  This is simply &quot; ILLEGAL &quot;... and is called a &quot; SCAM ''  What his hotel has on their booking page is not what you will get and be warned about it that the conditions are atrocious.   May I add that on the last day just before bedtime a cockroach roughly 6cm pops out from under the bed and starts crawling around the room while we try to catch it and then leaves under the carpet but we are not sure it was a cockroach as when we were complaining the manager unconsciously informs us that the hotel does have mouse issues.  Bu I am not surprised as in a basement these things happen? Don't they ? but obviously the hotel covers up. I have left the hotel together with the family and have complained to the management at the receptions which could not have cared less about our problems and which did not even look at us after complaining.  Even though we have gone I will be taking this matter further as I do retain that an underground room like that specifically used of families is not legally safe and does not comply with the health and safety regulations as there was absolutely NO WAY OF GETTING OUT in the case of a fire as you are in a &quot;hole&quot; !  I will be contacting personally the HSE and other health and safety authorities in regarding investigating case including the uk hotel hygiene authorities regarding rooms with cockroaches.   In conclusion this hotel can be categorised as a SCAM and these types of people have to be taken away from this business as there is absolutely no interest in guests and their safety. I am sure the hotel management will be responding in their defence on this website but please note that I am purely honest and have nothing to gain in writing this but telling you to save your money and your holidays.  and in regards to the hotel management they will be hearing from me again the health and safety authorities. "
-4; Stayed twice recently. On both occasions the room service came with no salt, vinegar or sauces. Fish and chips with no option for salt and vinegar? Who could possibly think that a good idea? Yet there was still a tray charge of around 30% and the usual receipt to sign encouraging you to tip more.  Meanwhile a pint of beer was nearly five pounds in the bar. Not even offered any free nuts with that.   Not impressed by the lack of attention to these small but important details. If you're going to charge top prices at least get the basics right. 
-4; Checked in to the hotel, and made our way to the room. Old decor to begin with, which wasn't appealing. Nevertheless, was willing to enjoy my stay. Went to the bathroom only to find underwear on the floor and pushed to the corner of the bathroom. How do you miss underwear when cleaning up? Begs the question, as to how clean the room actually was??? Spoke to reception staff and they were accepting of our issue and friendly in giving us options. They offered to move us to another room, but I didn't trust the cleanliness of any of the rooms after that episode. So they gave us a refund and we looked for another hotel. Hotel didn't even offer to cover our cost for the taxi towards looking for another hotel. 
-4; We lived locally and decided to stop for a bite to eat. It was early evening and therefore quiet at the bar. We often eat out 2 or 3 times a week and thought we would give it a try. For starters we had the fishcakes and white bait. Both were nice. However, the main course of duck was awful and the mash lumpy and for some strange reason had small chunks of cheese (feta I think). My husband had lamb chops. Overall the food was very average and the price £14.95 for the main courses in a pub (in need of a refurbish) was, I feel, too expensive. We are lucky to have lots of good pub food available in this area so I will not be going back in a hurry. 
-4; I am actually in the room as I write luckily we are leaving in the morning. This is the second time we stayed here the first time wasn't good as we had problems charging to our room due to the reception not booking us on correctly then there was a noisy party that you could hear all through the hotel. Finally we went to bed and the next room was playing music so loud I had to get up and bang the door to get it turned down. Anyway ww gave Novotel the benefit of the doubt and came again. Guess what, unable to charge to my room again because the check in man had not completed it properly and despite the fact I was actually sat opposite reception they did not think to correct this even when the bar called them. Decided to pay cash as the girl behind the bar seemed to judge that we either could not afford a £10 bar bill or we were going to do a runner. This time we had a lovely wedding party to listen to which would have been a joy if you were a massive fan of Bollywood and its associated soundtrack, we however are not. More fool us to think that this hotel would finally live up to its own 4 status as again it proves to be a fur coat with no knickers hotel with arrogant self important staff who seem to think that having a French accent makes them Raymond Blanc. I will never again darken the door of this totally useless hotel chain again and as an Accor business account holder I must admit that placing Novotel as a leading brand on the Mercure portfolio is a complete mistake as I have found it to be the worst. 
-4; i have just eaten for the third and last time here. I have persevered as I like the place so don't feel I am being unfair. meals are always on the small size so take a pie with you even if you can eat it. we asked if they had room for two to be told I suppose so but she is not going to take our order until 5.as it was 3 minutes to 5 we decided to stay.the waitress made a point of walking away and watching her watch then returned a couple of minutes later !!!!! we both ordered the sunday roast beef. when it landed it looked small as usual but very nice. the potatoes were like warm as usual but I was trying to be positive. the beef was so stringy you couldn't cut it so we asked for sharper knives.we both tried to cut it but really struggled.i tried to eat some of the beef but had to give up and leave it. being hungry I tried the Yorkshire pudding,this was crispy like a biscuit that crumbled when touched,clearly yesterdays. the staff apologised but offered nothing to make up for it or offered a refund. as I say I like the place as a drinking den along with other builders and foul mouth locals. so I will still go in but will avoid the food. there was a wedding on last time I was in and feel for them as at first glance the place looks ok.three star at best I am afraid. 
-4; Booked a night at the hotel as had an interview the day before - looking for somewhere that would be comfortable and able me to prepare for the day. The room was awful - the view was of the carpark and the room was fairly dirty. Looking to do some prep for the interview I was hoping for a desk in the room - however I was left disappointed to find that there was no desk in the room only a small glass table - asking if I could have a room with a desk I was told it would cost another £60 on what I had already paid! Not a great place would not recommend this at all! 
-4;I stay in Accors all over the UK and Europe for business and leisure. All good until now. I had myself and two colleagues staying at the Paddington Mecure. All bookings confirmed via email, but the receptionist would not agree that we had one of the bookings. It took nearly 2 hours for her to finally agree and give us one of the room keys. Truly awful. No one else got involved from management. A genuine exception to my usual experience, but not good.
-4;"We stayed from Friday 15th August to Monday 18th August this year.We booked a so called superior room,number 3, it was truly appalling.I won't bother to list all the faults,I did that to the management when requesting a change of room.This proved impossible as both Friday and Saturday were completely booked by wedding guests.We were allocated a &quot;privilege&quot; room for Sunday night which was better in every respect.On checking out we were told that Mr Biggin,the manager,would contact us to discuss compensation,which,to his credit,he did,returning £100 of our payment.If you are offered any room in the old part of the hotel,that is rooms 1 to 9,my advice is to run away as fast as you can.Also you'd be well advised to avoid this establishment if a wedding reception coincides with your stay."
-4;" Okay where to start.  Staff are slow and usually clueless as to what they are doing. On average it takes me 15 mins to check in. Even though I show them that I am on the loyalty program I still have to ask for the entitled extras.  There are no alarm clocks in the rooms. The reception desk cannot provide you with on either. I then asked for a wake up call and was told &quot;I might forget&quot;. I got the call....30 mins late.  The staff are moody and unfriendly.  The wifi is so slow I can't check my emails.  At the bar, the food takes ages and then they walk around asking everyone what they ordered repeatedly because they can't remember who ordered what. We were made to sign for everything we ordered instead of having a tab....okay fair play. But we ordered 2 drinks and sat down. The barman came over and told us that the bar was too busy for him to bring them. He then left and came back with a bill to sign, and waited till we had signed it. And still made us o collect our food and drinks.  At breakfast the service is just as bad. I had to ask for coffee 3 times before it came, by which point I had to get on with my day.  Overall I can't blame the staff. At this point it is the management to blame. I have long stretches in Exeter at clients. Now I will take my team elsewhere. "
-4; Having just had an Indian a few doors down we walked in to get a late drink whilst we waited for our taxi. We were two couples and it was 10.45. There were no people at the bar and only two other separate couples having a drink. To our amazement the young girl behind the bar told us it was too close to 11pm and refused to serve us whilst the other bar man behind the bar just turned his back on us. We walked over the road and got served in a different pub. Nice to see this place is doing so well that they can just turn people away with still 15 mins ordering time left. Hey ho. 
-4; The hotel room was basic but ok. Very hot and window would hardly open and when it was we were disturbed through the night by noise from the car park and residents below. Worst thing was I was using their car park for long stay and was given the option for a car wash for my return so car would be clean. The receptionist wanted cash in advance for that on arrival. When we returned the car was brought round and it looked like a wreck that had been parked under a cliff! It was absolutely smothered in birds poo and the bonnet covered in sandy grit. I was horrified and angry. The guy that brought it round said I should have paid for a car wash - which I had. The driver of the transfer bus that just dropped us off was laughing at the state of my car! I complained and was told no cash refund and I would have to contact Sarah at the hotel by email. I since left 5 messages and no response. I'd only had the car a few weeks so that made me feel worse. They dont say on the site that when you leave the car they then may move them off site while you are away. I care for my car a lot so will never use this place again and would not advise anyone else to do so... 
-4; Room great, staff great, especially concierge who checked our car and luggage in, facilities great, ambience great, everything was great except the food which was awful and sometimes the service was poor to non existent. Stayed for 2 nights while attending a wedding.  Had pork for dinner on first night, it was tougher than old boots. They ran out of the particular white wine we were drinking and the alternative was served warm. Breakfast next day (scrambled egg and bacon) was tasteless. The wedding 'feast' was appalling. Not sure what cut of lamb was served but it, like the pork, was so tough you needed a saw to cut it. I was told that the guests on the top table ie bride, groom and their parents didn't have their glasses re-filled for the speeches and toasts but we lower orders did. Breakfast next morning was as tasteless as the previous day. Service was terrible except one sweet smiling waitress delivered a small pot of coffee to our table of 4 and then disappeared as did the rest of the staff (and it wasn't late)  The bar staff were fine and managed an efficient and friendly service in spite of the place being very busy. I feel sorry for the bride and groom who had travelled from Australia to celebrate their wedding with family and friends and for their parents who were deeply upset and disappointed and embarrassed by the lack of promised quality. 
-4;" For a hotel that charges what it does you would think that the beds would be comfortable. My fiancé and I stayed over for a night after a wedding, the bed was one of those that are split in two so we spent the night rolling into the middle, not only that the mattresses were hard and lumpy and not flat. It was a good joke we had childcare for part of the next day as we had to go home and go to bed again, it was that bad. When checking out I was asked if we had enjoyed our stay, I told the receptionist about our bed and how bad a nights sleep we had and she replied with &quot;oh dear, and proceeded to charge what I personally think was a very high price for what we had. Next time we will be staying at a premier inn! "
-4; When I checked in on Monday evening my room had not been cleaned from the previous occupant. There were used tube tickets and used toiletries. There was a discarded letter addressed to the previous occupant. The bedding had not been changed. This is pretty basic stuff for any hotel. I called room service and they came and cleaned the room but this should never have happened. 
-4;" Me and my wife just got married and I booked a special evening for 1 night at the Peckforton on the 01/08/2013 mr and mrs Thomas. Upon arrival the venue was stunning, and first impressions were great, we checked in everything was fine. Later that evening we went down to dinner at 6:15pm and the brasserie was empty but there were 4 waiters standing around the bar laughing and joking, nobody came and approached us to sit us down. Then after much deliberation between the 4 of them someone came over and with a uninterested tone said &quot;have you booked a table?&quot; I replied yes for 6:30pm but my wife is pregnant so could we eat earlier? she sat us down and took our drinks order and returned not even pouring the into our glass what we had ordered? we then gave our food order and waited 20 minutes which is not bad, however after we had finished 30 minutes had passed before I had to go and fetch someone. At this point the chef had passed us over 20 times and not think to tell the staff tat we had finished and was waiting for our desserts. I then got someone from the bar to serve up our desserts, with sheer ignorance he managed to pull himself away from talking to other staff and moved to the kitchen. The girl who originally served us walked passed us chewing gum with a care free attitude and was in the kitchen laughing and joking with the other member of staff and took another 10 minutes to bring out the dessert? She eventually came out, did not apologise and slammed our dessert on the table in a rude manner. The whole experience was appalling including the evening where there was a wedding party who kept us up all night by being noisy and disturbing, the hotel would have known this so why put us in the room next to these wedding guests?   I must say I'm very shocked and disappointed with the whole experience I will not be staying here in the future, also they will not be getting my recommendation. I have feedback to the hotel and guess what typically no response from them, clear disregard for delivering exceptional service.  Regards, Mr & Mrs Thomas (Room 504) "
-4; Shocked after paying £9 for a cup of tea and a pint I was then extremely shocked to be asked to leave due to my dog barking at another dog......at first I thought the waiter was joking but not to be and me and my girlfriend were kicked out......I was quite insulted as my dog had been sitting very quietly until a different dog came in from the garden and stood at the bar......yet it was us asked to leave......I paid over the odds for a drink and then got kicked out for a barking dog...........nice pub but hugely over priced and NOT dog friendly. 
-4; I booked this hotel for a weekend away, on the day of the booking I went down with the flu and called to cancel. I was told that as I had booked through late rooms, they couldn't cancel for me or agree not to charge me and I had to call late rooms to request this. Late rooms cancelled the room but insisted that the overall decision to charge or not charge me was down to the hotel, so I called again and was told that there was little they could do as I had cancelled too late (I had). I called a little later to see if I could book a room (just to see if my room had been re booked out) and was told that they were completely full, so my room was clearly booked out to someone else and my card was charged £145.00 - I feel completely ripped off and conned by this hotel and feel ethically they clearly just don't care about the customer experience, just about taking your money. A real shame, I won't ever stay there now ( I am in Canterbury a lot so they would have got their moneys worth from me) and advise people not to if they value honesty. 
-4; If they are calling the room I have been allocated ' executive' then I don't hold out much hope for the food.  I think I will give the breakfast a miss and go to McDonalds instead. Really poor!  Very disappointed . 
-4; I would give this hotel negative stars If I could. While the check in process was an ease- my room was plagued with the awful smell of mold and mildew. This was so bad, it caused headaches, and difficulty breathing. Due to a busy schedule, I was unable to deal with the hassle of changing my room on my multi day stay. There is absolutely no way that any member of the hotel staff would not have noticed the fowl smell in this room and it is not excusable. Read other reviews, and you will find similar complaints.  Additionally, my incidentals are guaranteed by my employer (for ease of check in), and to be settled during check out. The hotel obviously disregarded our company policy as they immediately put a letter under the door stating that a credit card needed to be put down at the desk immediately.  The rest of the staff seemed friendly- but in the industry of hospitality, it's hard to feel welcomed in a room that you don't even want to be in.  This hotel is a definite health risk. Be advised. Call to Hilton corporate is next. 
-4; booked to stop here for New Year's Eve, upon entering room 208 there was a strong smell of damp popped back out and on return again same smell, used the ensuite floor was covered in long black hairs all under the sink area was stained what look like blood, very disgusting not what you'd expect when your paying premium prices, rang reception explained that the room smelt of damp and was unclean, no shock to the receptionist as she said they smell like that because they cannot open the windows!!! I'm sure we have all stopped in hotels that have the same style windows and they don't smell of damp! So another words tuff no sorry at all she just sent house keeping up that cleaned the said hairs and stains thus made us very late for our evening then whilst getting ready my girlfriends sees all long black hairs all over the floor in front of the mirror then we find them all over one of the towels!!!!! Very annoyed after paying so much then get a parking charge from the car park of £16.50 should of been £19.00 but the hotel give you a messily 15% discount overall disappointed BEWARE! 
-4;Got to be the worse service ever, duty manger Rodrick needs to redo customer service course. Group of us 32 booked and pre ordered meals in advance, meals came out sporadically and he was rude from start
-4;" On arrival at this hotel, I suddenly got that sinking feeling in my stomach that comes with realising you've made a booking error. The professed 2 million pound refurbishment was nowhere to be seen. Some slight modernisation of the communal areas, such as the bar, looked ok but the 'lift out of order' sign was reminiscent of something out of 'Faulty Towers' and clearly had been there for some time.  After being advised about the lift (apparently part of important renovations, though no work was actually going on at the time) we were advised that our room was on the top floor, up four flights of stairs. Not ideal.  On entering the room, my heart sank yet further. The room was very dated, scruffy, smelled of smoke, was very small, and stiflingly hot. There was no sign of the promised 'wall thermostat' and the only source of temperature regulation was a very small office desk fan in the cupboard. On top of that, the sink was blocked, the shower stuck in a bizarre position and the water pressure was very low.  During the night we had the tiny desk fan pointed at us, which smelled of burning plastic and the window open, which was incredibly noisy. Not ideal after a 7 hour drive for a job interview. I was woken at about 3am, red hot, with the noise from outside. This led to a quick trip to the bathroom for a glass of cold water... but unfortunately the water was warm out of the cold tap.  After making a complaint the next morning we were moved to another room; apparently an upgrade. In actual fact, the room itself was pretty much identical, though it had a ceiling fan and two biscuits on the tea tray. (Obviously a token gesture). Ceiling fan it may have had, but unfortunately no controller to turn it on, just a holster on the wall. The bath also leaked constantly and wouldn't hold water. So much for a relaxing soak.  On going down to complain again, a woman at reception was booking a cab for herself: 'Where are you going?' Said the receptionist. 'To warn people how bad your hotel is', said the lady. The man next to her, making his own complaint, had just been given a key to a room with someone in it. Thankfully they were fully dressed.  On complaining for the second time I was told that the hotel was full and that I would be given a discount on checkout. At this point we went to the bar and ordered some nachos. When they arrived they looked limp, cold and soggy. The promised toppings were missing and they tasted awful.  To sum up, if you want a nice experience in Bournemouth then don't stay at the Hallmark hotel. it was truly one of the worst I've ever stayed in. You would get more for your money at the generic 'chain hotel' around the corner with the same positioning. "
-4; This looks like a venue perfect for golf, weddings, functions and the line. But be aware of the noise until 4am which we had for each of the three nights we were there. Rooms were well appointed but needed to be because sleep was impossible. We had breakfast each day which was good. The evening meals sadly were it seemed thrown together and of poor quality. It was a good job we played some other great local golf and ate there. Do not want to stay there again, very disappointed 
-4; Nice hotel, but there is not enough parking and very little on street parking nearby. If you do get on street parking ts on a meter with a 4 hour maximum stay. As for the heating / cooling in the room, you get a dial with a + and a - on it, so you have no idea how much to turn it to warm up or cool down the room 
-4;I was not going to bother writing a review due to my annoyance at wasting a week of my life at the Sandbanks.The hotel does not deserve it's 4 star rating,  When we got to our room the Kids were presented with a sofa bed which had no support at all, I ended offering the kids my double bed whilest I slept on the floor, the next day I mentioned this to the manager and he put in a pair of cheapo foldout 1970's Z-beds to sleep on, that's right your kids are treated like second class citizens in a 4 star hotel  The double bed left me with terrible back and leg pains, so I could not enjoy the splendid poole area and thats from someone that is as strong as a pair of oxen,   Housekeeping is non existent, we came back to a room which had not been cleaned, the towels had not been replaced, frankly I expect that the staff were too busy wasting time making crab shapes out of the towels!!!   The baby high chairs at breakfast were always filthy with bits of food lodged in the cervices from the previous occupant, they did not have the foresight to give the seats a wipe down prior to the next use so they spent a while looking for cleaning materials  The terrace bar food was horrible, anyone with any taste would not eat there, my pasta tasted like paper and the sauce was just gray water, The Hotel facilities are open to the general public, the terrace bar on the weekend when we arrived was full of the great unwashed, not what I paid for,  The swimming pool is small, cold and poorly lit, the lifeguard was nowehere to be seen and with all sorts of kids jumping in splashing like nutters it was very unpleasant  And the view of the harbour was more like a view of the car park, with a small patch of water. I also mentioned this to the manager, he said that in all of the 16 years he had been there no one had ever complained about it not being a harbour view an that most people complained that it was a view of the car park, well does that not tell you Mr Manger that you need to stop advertising the room as a Harbour view when only a small fraction of the view is of the harbour   I could go on but I can't be bothered hey just like the sandbanks  The Stay was bad enough that we ended up checking out 3 days early, The only good thing about the Sandbanks was leaving
-4;" I was really looking forward to my overnight stay with dinner as I had last visited in the early 60's with my parents when it was alongside the Great North Road and had a reputation as &quot;cock of the north&quot; when it came to food. How sad that I must report that today it would deserve the epithet of &quot;cock-up of the north&quot;. I was booked into a double room on the ground floor at £85 per night with breakfast and dinner extra, The room had been refurbished relatively recently but Wi-Fi did not work, the radiator was on so the room was too warm, the window was dirty, the teatray was at groundlevel and not user friendly, the bath/over shower had NO SAFETY HANDRAILS to ease access, no peg for hanging a towel while showering, the huge wall mirror had no heating so quickly misted, the Black Sheep beer in the bar was off, the food in the dining room was badly prepared ie pork belly had been microwaved and the crackling was like leather. I guess readers will get my drift so looking for positives - slept quite well, staff helpful if lacking professionalism, desk and chair in the bedroom both comfortable and TV worked. Overall still a most disappointing visit. "
-4; This is probably one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in arrived at 2.30 room wasn't ready charged for an extra meal wanted 2 single beds got a kingsize waited over an hour to take our sweet order and the list goes on 
-4;" This is our experience, and all was given directly to the Duty Manager on the day, who gave us a £20 discount.  1) Car park. Arrived after a 3 hour journey to find it was full. Had to drop off my wife with our bags and drive around Bedford trying to find a space. In the time I was doing that she managed to stand in a freed up space and call me to come back. If you're staying overnight you should be able to reserve a space at the hotel.  2) Check in. Arrived at 14:30 and told the rooms weren't ready (The hotel says you can check in from 14:00. We sat opposite reception (so in their full view) waiting for 30 minutes, when I noticed another receptionist checking other guests in, whilst the original receptionist continued to ignore us. I asked what was going on and was given a room immediately, as if nothing was amiss. A very bad start.  3) The room. Dirty. The bathroom was filthy with dirt growing up the tiles. It was a non-smoking room, but because other smoking rooms are nearby, we spent the entire night feeling sick at the stench of other's smoke. That was probably the worst part of the stay. Why the Swan persist in allowing smoking rooms is beyond me. It's not the 1970's anymore...I phoned to complain and was simply told &quot;yep, we have smoking rooms&quot;.  Light streamed in through the big gap under the door and through the window lighting up the room, adding to a bad night's (lack of) sleep. The room was also far too hot (even in November) and we couldn't open the window due to the noise of a party in another part of the hotel. The aircon was ineffective.  Finally, the room is one of those where the rooms are lit by frustratingly ineffective low energy (not LED) light bulbs, meaning you're straining to see what you're doing.  Generally the hotel badly needs refurbishment, and has a general grubby feeling from the room and main areas. It's such a shame, as it's in a prime location and looks beautiful from the outside.  The breakfast is adequate, but everything is kept in water heated metal warmers. This creates steam, making the hash browns etc soft, when they should be crisp. For £14 per person, I'd expect better.  I would stay there again, but only if no other hotel was available. "
-4; We have used this pub many times before. It is a lovely building in a great location but has never exceeded on service or quality of staff being very much a number cruncher & this unfortunately is very evident throughout but having not stayed here previously we were not prepared for what greeted us.   Checking in we were greeted by a pile of junk including reams of printer paper, yellow plastic slippery floor warning sign which had found it's way out of the nearby kitchen door & other junk. This was all beside the reception, a pretty awful eye saw. Having checked in we were told our room was number 7, up around 25 steps, some guests would struggle with their cases as no help was offered. First room dogs hairs everywhere & the writing pad & what to do info just slung on the dressing table. Having complained the assistant manager appeared & muttered various words including how disgusting, his staff had let him down & you cant stay here I will find another room.  He reappeared & gave us the key to room 9, one door away. This room was not an improvement, the curtain track & pelmet were broken & hanging off, the windows you could not see out of because the glass had 'popped' & condensated & there was something very suspicious over one corner of a window & frame!  This room had a four poster bed with visible dust & cobwebs on the frame..we ran our hand along it & it 'snowed'. My wife made the mistake of walking on the grass outside our room whilst waiting for the assistant manager to reappear & unfortunately found some dog poo which had not been cleared away by previous irresponsible dog owners who had let their dog use the grass as a loo, or indeed cleared by staff.. one ruined pair of shoes! The assistant manager re appeared, seemed quite shocked yet again & simply said 'I will not let you sleep in here' & disappeared to find yet another room! These rooms were priced at £139 per night!  Room 3 was down the steps & off the car park. We were told that someone would collect our bags but no one appeared so we moved ourselves again. This room it was pointed out was dearer that the other two, larger & should be fine.  Larger it was but the standard of cleaning was pretty awful. Dirty carpet which was badly stained & had not been cleaned properly, the extractor was filthy & there was an odorous smell in the bathroom coming from the loo brush.  The room was large & very hot but unfortunately had only one very small window at the car park end beside the door which was just not adequate to get air into the room. It was not an option to open the door as it was directly on the car park.  We had booked a table for dinner but having experienced our 3 room disaster & looked at the pretty uninspired menu quickly made other arrangements. There were a couple of specials floating around which had escaped the corporate menu..half a lobster at £45 & chateaubriand for two at £65! I think the chef should stick to his corporate menu..it's all done for him!  You can eat at any Rick Stein restaurant & enjoy a whole local lobster for £42. Chateaubriand for two you can find in most quality restaurants for around £40..think the chef here has delusions of grandeur.  Apart from the breakfast which was good & the staff polite although some seemed oblivious to dirty plates on tables our experience was abysmal & totally spoilt our stay. The assistant manager Cam reduced our bill when we checked out but not wanting to make a scene in front of other guests I paid it & will take it up with St Austell direct. He was polite enough but quite clearly was out of his depth..hands tied. The whole bill should have been scrapped excluding breakfast The lady on the reception was extremely nice & did her best to smooth things over. Having asked for the manager the evening before & the following morning we never saw him, he had disappeared into thin air leaving his staff to sort out the mess which at the end of the day was of his making. Judging by our experience this guy should not be at the helm, clearly without standards & certainly not supporting his staff! Questions should be asked about St Austell's BDM's roll who clearly is not keeping his finger on the pulse!   Normally I would not write such a review or indeed submit photo's but the standards here are non existent & quite where they pluck their prices from is anybody's guess.  By contrast we spent a fabulous week wining & dining at another St Austell managed house, the St Kew at St Kew in Cornwall. We could not fault any aspect of our time there, the service & quality of food & ales was always amazing despite the pub being exceptionally busy lunchtime & evening, the staff always professional but fun..a great team with the resulting impeccable standards. 
-4;" stayed here for one night and left my vehicle in &quot; Car Park C&quot; for 15 days, only to return to see that my pride and joy had been broken into , smashed passenger window , glass everywhere , there was nothing in the as i knew i was going to leave the car for my holiday. police was informed by the hotel that there was no cctv in that area , WELL WHAT IS THE POINT IN PROVIDING A PARKING SERVICE!!!! PARK AT YOUR OWN RISK AT THIS HOTEL!!!!! pity because the hotel was OK "
-4; I'd start by saying that I have written directly to the Hotel GM concerning our stay. Having booked a park and stay break we arrived the night before and the meet and greet a driver was already there and the handover was very good. Check in was fine, room on the 4th floor, clean and comfortable. Changed and ready for dinner we ate at the downstairs bar and lounge, ordered a couple of salads and a bottle of wine, followed by a couple of drinks..food was good but basically a salad. Looking forward to a peaceful night as an early check in for a long haul flight the following day. Then the problems started...the fire alarm went off at 6.30am, dressed and left to see confusion...guests were not sure if it was a false alarm or real there were no staff directing people to exits, when you found the exits there were no staff moving guests to collection points..no fire officers, no fire tenders I could see and no signs of a fire or any signs of any hotel or fire officials! People were milling around in the lobby and some guests went back to their rooms. Total confusion and no information...by now having had the chance to read my express check out bill, the two salads, some drinks, and a bottle of wine for two had come to a staggering £123 for what was a bar meal. Add that to the £199 paid for the stay, one night at this Hotel with parking had come to nearly £325!  Now in danger of missing our check in, and no sign of any staff or update or information we went back to the room to collect the bags and dash to the terminal to check in...angry and frustrated, not relaxed and looking forward to the holiday.  Be aware that in the bar lounge on the ground floor there is a service charge added for every visit to your table, the cost of food is exorbitant as are the drink costs, watch out for mandatory service charges even if sitting at low tables in the bar which is where we were.  This wasn't our first stay here, it will be our last I am sorry to say. 
-4;" Having stayed in the Trafalgar Square branch several weeks ago I was expecting the same standards and service but have been left feeling badly let down. The areas of the hotel I have seen leading to the rooms on several floors are undergoing &quot;upgrading&quot; as the signs stuck to the walls on these floors advise. Carpets are in various stages of being laid, walls have sizeable holes in them where fittings/sockets have been removed and the wallpaper is in various degrees of being replaced, some parts don't have any wallpaper or indeed carpets.  The first room is was placed in on my first of four nights was extremely noisy so much so that on the second night I was offered a move shortly before midnight. I was assured I would be offered a &quot;quieter&quot; room but when I entered this there was an odour and I realised I, who has never smoked, had been placed in a smoking room. I did attempt to stay in this but lasted 30 minutes until the smell got to me, indeed even the bedding (especially the pillows) had an unpleasant odour. When I raised this with the manager shortly after midnight he seemed disinterested and I was astonished at the attitude especially given what the calibre of this hotel should be. I was then move for a further time and whilst this room appears good, the only thing is that it is on the main street so there is a bit of traffic noise even in the early hours and some sort of workman banging in the street!.  I know Club Quarter can do better than this and feel that they should review their standards in this branch as a matter of urgency. I certainly will ensure I do not stay here again! "
-4;" We have just stayed at the hotel and our main comment would be &quot;close your doors until your refurbishment is complete&quot;. On arrival at the hotel our first view was of scaffolding surrounding the building. We checked in and went to our room, on opening the door we saw a tired room with wall paper coming off the wall, a stained ceiling and the shower black with mildew or some form of mould and a worn out carpet. Enough said we returned to reception and handed the key back to a very friendly and helpfully receptionist who offered us the 4 poster suite if we would stay, after inspecting the room we decided to stay even though the room was passed its best (about 10 years). After our evening meal we sat in the lounge which was cold, other guests asked if the fire could be lit but were told that the chimney had been cleaned and the sweep had not left the certificate so they couldn't light the fire. We retired to our room at an early 9.30pm to warm up and watch tv only to find that it was to cold in the lounge so decided to watch tv in bed. Ok well no, we could only get three programmes two children's channels and some other rubbish channel.We had booked for two nights but next morning after a good breakfast we decided to pack our bags and go home, after all why pay for something that you wouldn't put up with at home. This hotel will probably be excellent when the refurbishment is complete provided it is a full refurb and not just a 30 minute make over. "
-4;" We as a family of seven attended butlins minehead for our one and only (not cheap) seven day friday to friday family holiday two weeks ago, we were in silver accommodation with a meal plan in the Ocean Drive Diner. We arrived Friday and all seemed ok, chalet was a bit grubby and bed linen was questionable. we ate in the diner and food seemed ok with variety. We did things over the next couple of days and nights on site. however by monday my daughter became ill and was not well with having to go to the toilet alot, in the night she was sick in her sleep. I went to guest services on the Tuesday morning to request some clean linen as my daughter had been ill, to which they replied &quot;oh illness fill this form in please&quot; so i took the form back and me and my partner filled this form in ranging from questions like. when did we arrive? when will we leave? where had we been? where had we eaten? what had we eaten? was any one ill before we came? or ill on transport here? to which no-one was or had been. And the only food we'd eaten was what we had eaten in their Ocean Drive Diner. I then took it back and handed it in, not even 10 minutes went by and my partner had a phone call to say we as a whole family should stay in our chalet and not go out and use the facilities. we will be in isolation!!!!!! And the food we would have been provided would consist of a cold packed lunch. At this point i was not happy with this outcome or their reaction, at no point had we seen any medical professional to establish that what my daughter had, or was it just down to either over eating or just a stomach bug. We were then passed on to a team leader who then insisted that we leave today as we could be carrying the norovirus i replied &quot;who are you to make that decision you are not a doctor we'll go and see one&quot; they said no medical professional would see us as it is that contagious and we wouldn't be allowed in to the doctors surgery. At this stage my daughter was feeling a lot better, but that didn't seem to matter at this point they just wanted us off the camp site and pronto asking what would the earliest we could go!!! we packed up, left feeling ostracised and humiliated. We continued our holiday at an extra cost somewhere else and not one other of our seven family members were ill, and my daughter was as right as rain with in those 24hrs. Prehaps the amount of sanitizer hand gels placed everywhere around the place and i mean EVERYWHERE should have rang alarm bells. plus if the state of the public toilets where to go by my daughter wasn't the only person on that site who was suffering "
-4; The Royal Bath Spa hotel looks from the outside like it is a charming, welcoming establishment just waiting to swallow you up. The reality, when you walk through the door is very different. The front desk is under manned and the welcome is underwhelming. After a long wait and a miserable check-in we found our room (a club double) to be about the size of a phone box. The wardrobe blocked the path from the bathroom to the bed and the bathroom sink was so small that I couldn't get my hands into it. However, the water pressure was so high that simply tuning on the tap meant that my clothes were totally soaked. The towels in the bathroom were about the size of a postage stamp. We mistakenly opted to take breakfast at the hotel. The food was cold and under cooked (except the eggs which were kept under a hot lamp and were as hard as a rock.) The tea was warm and weak and the coffee was like drinking cold mud. The public areas were dirty and the staff were sullen and clearly lacking in any form of training. We witnessed the barman and his supervisor having a stand up row resulting in the barman throwing bottles and glasses on the floor.   I will NEVER stay in this hotel EVER again. It was an absolute waste of money and the management appear not to give a damn. 
-4; The room was acceptable (though considering it had been redecorated recently the bathroom left something to be desired), but the noise from the neighbouring nightclubs meant that we didn't get to sleep until well past midnight.   Add this to the inadequate explanation of the car parking situation (where you need to park in the train station's car park, get a discount applied to your voucher and pay for your parking at the station) which meant we did not receive our discounted parking and I would definitely say we will not be staying at this or another Hallmark Hotel again!. 
-4; We visited for the Valentines package, having stopped at great Village Hotels for all over the Country.  The whole experience was awful, and ruined Valentines for us. A total waste of £120  Our first room was freezing cold. We asked to move, and it took an hour to move. The second room overlooked the air conditioning units that were loud all night.  The leisure facilities, in fairness, are great and it was the one slight highlight.  The evening meal was nothing short of a disaster. We sat down for our 9 pm meal about 8.50. We were given a drink at about 9.30, our starter about 10 and our main about 11. The chateaubriand was appalling. Already carved , defeating the object, and lukewarm. One portion of chips between two and some stodgy spinach thing which was awful. The singer( very good ) came in , set up, did his set, packed down and left between our starter and main. We had to refuse desert as it was gone 11. The staff were friendly and apologetic, but it ruined our stay.  Breakfast was lukewarm, and nearly every table had not been cleared. If only I could post the photos of our stay on here !!! We were given a 50 per cent refund, which in my eyes is not good enough. If I hadn't pre paid I would have refused to pay. I work a lot in Solihull and will share my experience with everyone I can in that area. 
-4; This is probably the worst room I've ever stayed in. Truly awful. It was a single room on the top floor. No bathroom, just shared facilities down a narrow corridor. No tea/coffee making facilities. No curtains. Broken lamp. And staff who didn't care less. Woeful.      
-4;" I woud not bother to entertain this hotel - because if you have any disgreement over something it is likely to be met with a threat.  I turned up with a partner and an octogenarian after a circuitous five hour journey from Surrey to find that the walk from what appeared to be a car park a little too far for my elderly stepmother to walk. I parked in an unmarked parking space to let my partner check in and I carefully parked in the one left space. I came in to the reception and was told that a registration number of my car was needed. I returned to the car and back to the reception and was trying to recall the plate number, so cut short the receptionist from giving out information to my partner.I noticed that she was making heavenward gestures with her eyes as she clearly did not notice that I was observing her as I was speaking to my wife!! So as we departed the reception area - she said that I had to move my car - I replied that I was not about to do that. The only reason was that I wanted to make my elderly relative comfortable with some refreshment whilst we waited for our accommodation to be ready. Then I was more than happy to move my car. This also incensed me as I did phone prior to arrival to say we would be early. This too seems to have been overlooked.  I walked to the reception level bar to see if it was open so that I could leave the two weary ladies there with some refreshment - but there seemed to be some function going on and the bar was shut.   I then stepped back to the reception area to be confronted by a staff who told me that I must park my car elsewhere. There were many other cars there and by the tone of his introduction (I had to ask him his name, and he only gave me his first name and not even his title!!) I felt that I had no option but to decline his aggressive attitude.The pointless argument could have been resolved immediately if he had bothered to ask me when I would move the car and not, &quot;I am tasked with clearing the area and you must move your car now!&quot; When I pointed out that there were other cars parked in the area, he replied that the cars will be moved later when golfers return after their game. So until that point the area would not be cleared.   The next thing was the unbelievable statement of &quot;I will clamp your car if it is not moved&quot; Well - in that case, why were the other cars not clamped already if the issue was so urgent. Clamping would just mean area will never cleared!  At this point after this individual was closer to me physically than a rugby scrum acquaintance, it was the point when I decided to leave and move to another hotel.  He then made a comment to my partner of &quot;good luck&quot; uttered in such a sarcastic manner, it incensed me more that I had to ask him what he meant by that.  This &quot;manager&quot; clearly put me into an impossible situation - A fight or flight situation and as I was at the tipping point I decided to go elsewhere.  And when the wife then returned to the reception to enquire - the receptionist told her in no uncertain terms that the charge would be in full.  I returned another 30 minutes later to see that cars were still parked there. No wonder this hotel is to be sold - cant deliver and cant handle guests.  Finally - dont expect this hotel - despite alleging that it is 4 star - to move your car for you - it wont - no concierge - that request was rebuffed with an open palm down gesture and I quote &quot; I am not insured to move your car.&quot; "
-4; For valentines weekend my partner and I decided to spend the night somewhere with a nice reputation and go all out on a nice room for two. We decided to go to Dunston Hall, which turned out to be a big mistake.  To start with upon entering our room, we find the 'king size bed' we had specifically paid for was in fact two single beds pushed together ! This for obvious reasons was extremely uncomfortable due to the massive crack down the middle.  Putting this aside we explored the rest of our room. We discovered the incredibly dirty bathroom. The seals around the bath were yellow, the bath itself had scum and dirty water marks all over, there was other peoples hair in the bath and all over the floor. The corners of the room looked as if someone had purposefully pushed dirt into the corner because they couldn't be bothered to pick it up.  We then turned on our lovely television....which was broken and not lovely at all.  Later that evening we had a meal booked in their restaurant, I decided to use the rooms supplied iron to iron my shirt. Even on its lowest setting the iron was so hot it filled the room with an awful burning smell.  Really paying the amount we did for this so called 'King size room' is diabolical. To top it all off after 4 days after emailing them about our stay they haven't bothered to contact us !  So if you planning on spending the weekend away with someone, by yourself, or with family. Don't bother going to the horrendous, over rated hotel. 
-4; Want to keep this brief as don't want to waste more time than I have already with this hotel. First the room was booked by my company but instead of 2 occupants they booked one, reception said to change it would cost £10. The price wasn't an issue, the principal was! Having one person or two people stay is irrelevant to them to justify any charge! They said it was because they have to inform security. Hardly £10 worth of work!  The room tiny with about an inch of space to move to the other side of the bed, internet too slow to use unless you pay, hotel the noisiest I have ever stayed in with what I think is the tube literally shaking the building every 2 mins (even though we stayed 6 floors up) room too hot, no windows to let light in, no water providing, iron poor quality   Only plus points  Location close to station Bed fairly comfy Plugs close to bed  Def not 4star, avoid! 
-4;Perhaps we were unlucky, but our stay was plagued by a catalog of problems from the moment we arrived. Firstly, we checked in at about 11pm and found that there were no parking spaces in the Novotel car park. The receptionist intimated that the car park opposite (next to a Chinese restaurant) was affiliated with the hotel, and told us to park there. The car park was not linked to the hotel, and the tariff required me to buy a new ticket for the car at 8am.  The room was tiny and boiling hot when we arrived. Inexplicably, the toilet in the room was not connected to the bathroom, and did not contain a sink. The pillows were large and square for some reason. The lack of soundproofing in the rooms meant that we could hear people urinating in other rooms, and every word and knock from a wedding party returning to their rooms at 2am.  The following morning, we went to draw our curtains to find that only one half of the curtain was actually in front of a window, whilst the other half concealed a wall. We found that the shower door opened inwards, making it difficult for even a slim person to get into the shower. Upon checking out we were asked to pay for breakfast, which the receptionist from the night of our arrival had told us (twice) was prepaid. Also, somebody had charged drinks to our room, which thankfully we were excused from paying for.  Rightly, or wrongly, these disappointments cast a negative light on everything we experienced during our stay. On a positive note, the lobby was nice, as was the (overpriced) breakfast and the service in the restaurant.
-4; This hotel is isolated from Crawley and must be reached by car. Car park is expensive but a good size. Rooms are well equipped but no fridge, but the beds are very comfortable. Located near to Gatwick's Westerly runway and the M23, it is still surprisingly quiet. Very few staff ever about, and never once did they pickup the phone at reception in 48 hours.  Breakfast is a buffet and there is a mountain of food. The cold buffet is very good, but again top price. The hot food is pre cooked a long time in advance of the meal resulting in hard fried eggs and rubbery scrambled eggs. I asked for more eggs to be made and reluctantly this was done. The bacon however is mounted in a large stack, with varying temperatures ranging from slightly warm to hot. I asked for fresh bacon as I consider pork and bacon products at these temperatures as potentially dangerous. This was refused. The front desk manager said it was legal and they have 5 stars so it's OK. I declined the breakfast charge and was frankly amazed by the attitude and the profits put before safety and food taste. I am ashamed to be an IDH member. Given the add on charges which resemble a Ryanair booking I would seriously avoid this hotel for price, quality and convenience as well as food safety. Pity, as it has potential to be a really nice secluded retreat but needs more staff and a chef that paces his output to match the clients. 
-4; The hotel is in a run down area of Tower Hamlets. Shoreditch is about 1 mile away! On arrival, the receptionist could hardly understand English and attempted to charge my credit card for the full amount of my stay even though I had prepaid. Drug addicts kept us awake most of the night with their noisy shouting, outside our window, on 2 of the 4 nights we stayed there. The staff seem to live in a world of their own, they hardly know what is going on, and on one occasion refused to eject rowdy and disruptive drinkers from the hotel. 
-4;" This was the worst experience I have had in a Hilton. As a Gold member I expected at the very least a little service - however; several things just did NOT go right: - Queue to Gold check-in -- not manned - when checking in -- the lady (pleasant enough) told me as a gold member I would get a room upgrade - Did not. I was also given a voucher for a free drink at the bar - - well... - went to the bar to have my drink after a very long day travelling and the waiter was APPAULING. tried to embarrassed me infront of other customers that &quot;other customers do not have a free drink&quot; and why was I? Several times I said to him please stop - are you trying to embarrassed me - he did not stop -- finally just left the bar in TOTAL DISGUST. - went back to my room and rang down to complain to duty manager - again over the telephone pleasant enough -- saying sorry etc. and promised me that free drink - to be sent to my room - that was 6pm... it was 10pm and nothing - went to sleep - only to be woken up at 10.30 with the knock on my door with my free drink... I did not throw it at the water because it was not his fault but REALLY.... APPALLING AND DISGRACEFULL... ONLY USE THIS HOTEL BECAUSE MY COMPANY HAS AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM - PERSONALLY - I WOULD NOT... "
-4;"Stayed in this place for 3 nights. The hotel is shabby as others have said, looks dated at best and wouldnt be out of place as a B&B in a seaside town. The staff are generally unfriendly and unhelpful, service at the hotel restaurant is painful at best.  I ate 4 meals in the restaurant. All of them came with their &quot;rustic chips&quot; I still have no idea what makes them rustic but on none of the 4 occasions could they have been anything more than warm. The food from the menu was disappointing but the breakfast buffet was shocking. Everything was pretty much cold and hard by 0730 so unless you can be there when it opens or will settle for cerial/yoghurt then give it a miss.  The only good thing about this shabby seaside fawlty towers in the middle of nowhere is the gym facilities but they appear to be open to the public/membership so is full of regulars and body builders. The place is always busy and not somewhere that you can feel comfortable unless you are a regular gym goer.  All in all, a terrible 3 nights stay that I will never repeat or recommend to anyone."
-2; If you have booked to go on a coach tour to this hotel, {CANCEL} I have just read 40 reviews, all of which were private guests, most were complimentary. We were there from Sunday 12th to Wednesday 15th October 2014. We were treated like 2nd class citizens for the first 2 nights, but after our driver complained to the manager & the coach company who then contacted the agents they couldn't do enough for us on our last night, we had pre dinner wine & nibbles plus the service was amazing, having said that there were only 6 private guests in the dining room. Examples of how bad the service was is that our meal time for each evening was 7pm, Sunday night a bread roll came at 7.05pm, the starter 7.20pm, Main course 8pm, sweet at 8.20pm. We should have had Tea & Coffee but we didn't receive any but after our driver commented about it to the manager we did get T & C the other nights, plus on Monday evening complimentary wine. Six golfing private guests came in the dining room and one spoke to me & noticed at 8.15pm NOT one person was eating, I counted 37 people, it was so strange to see in a hotel restaurant. If you think that is bad, read on. Monday 13th bread roll 7.15pm, starter 7.35pm, main course 8.15pm, sweet 8.35pm. We didn't stop for T & C just in case they brought Horlicks & Cocoa. There are pluses to this visit, the room we had was very nice & also clean. The food we had could not be faulted, but if that is the best they can do with a coach party we will NEVER ever stop at a MacDonald's Hotel again. I will be very interested to any comments Jason N manager make. 
-2; We have a family Sunday lunch every year so that we can all get together. Having previously been disappointed by pub carveries, we decided that it may well be worthwhile upgrading to somewhere a bit more upmarket. The Oaksmere seemed ideal from what we had heard and read on the website. We booked for 18 people (including 4 children) a month in advance. There was some confusion regarding whether we needed to pre-order or not. It was eventually decided that pre-ordering wasn't necessary.   Shame about pre-ordering. If we had there might have been a better chance of all getting what we wanted. There was not enough pork to go around all those who wanted it. One who had wanted pork changed to chicken. That was a mistake. The chicken breast was not fully cooked and was raw in the middle. Of the rest of the meals, some plates were hot, some were stone cold. Some vegetables were properly cooked, some were still hard. There was no where near enough gravy to go around adequately. There was no mint sauce for the lamb.  Next to the desserts. Surprise, surprise there was not enough chocolate brownie for all those who wanted it. Those that did get it found it luke warm and very stodgy. As for the sticky toffee pudding. Everyone agreed it was the worst that they have ever had. Heavy and tasteless was the unanimous decision with nowhere near enough sauce.   At least the management did not charge for the raw chicken or the 4 remaining chocolate brownies. It was interesting to observe that the managers seemed to disappear to leave the waiting staff to cope with the mounting complaints. We eventually left the Oaksmere after nearly 3 hours, the service was definitely not fast! When we had all paid our bills, there was a chicken terrine left unpaid for. No one in our party had a chicken terrine! They really have to shake up the kitchen staff and ensure that there are enough staff available to cope with a large party at the Oaksmere. It is nowhere near good enough for an establishment that is aspiring for better end of the market. There are now 14 adults that will not go to or recommend Oaksmere again. 
-2; It's been a while since I last stayed here and it looks like time has stood still for this hotel. There have been a few changes to the bar area and foyer but the lack of investment in the rooms is evident. The staff try their best but face an uphill battle and it will be a very long time before I visit again. 
-2; A friend won a one night stay in a standard room due to her excellent charity work. Fortunatly she was not able to spare the time to take a holiday over the 2 month period that she was given so allowed myself and her son to go instead. Upon arrival we were overwhealmed by the specacular building and lovely man in tophat and tailcoat who opened the door for us. This was where it went downhill for the first day.  Check-in does not start untill 3 so after a long day traveling we had to wait a fair while and were not made to feel welcome at all in the lobby so left after a short while  Later that afternoon we were taken to our room, a twin disabled access room (presumably for the disabled charity work the stay was won in account of). After being promised a bath we were disapointed to find only a shower although the chair in the shower lifted our spirits a bit. The shower was cold and after a few seconds of a freezing cold water it broke. :( The shower was abruptly fixed but nothing could be done about the cold water, Brr! The room was clean enough but otherwise unimpressive and rather outdated compared to cheaper stays I have had elsewhere.  On a redeeming factor breakfast was wonderful and the whole lobby/ downstairs area while having a frosty reception is spectacular.  I can immagine this place is lovely for an older visitor where the staff have the time of day for you but as a young or disabled visitor i would avoid it (based on 1 experience)  Overall I was very disapointed with the service received (possibly due to me being young and casually dressed). If I had paid for the room or had taken the time out of work to treat myself to this stay I would have been livid! however I did not and just treated it as a 20 pound a night hotel with a fancy front room that I didnt pay for. Happy all round as Manchester is a brilliant city and I had a great time 
-2; booked a weeks fishing last year june 2014 with promises of good fishing. Very poor access to lakes that is the ones we could fish as most of the lakes had private fishing on them.  We asked at reception about these and they told us if these were unoccupied then use them we are glad we didn't pay for the weeks permit we only fished one day which was appauling. Finnished up travelling to bains fisheries every day to fish (fantastic place) pitty it didn't have any accommodation on site. Won't be useing tattershall country park again shouldn't be advertised as a fishing venue 
-2; I had forgotten that I had stayed at this hotel about 2/3 years ago and vowed never to return. I should have been suspicious as I booked it quite late and it was about the only hotel that had availability within a 30+ mile radius of Liverpool. I booked one of the junior suites. Huge room pleasantly positioned overlooking the bins and disguarded catering trollies. Dated to the point that my grandmother would have been unhappy at the decor (she is 103) but the worst aspect was that I could hear every single footstep, every single word and every single 'noise' from the room upstairs. The floor boards creaked to the point of distraction and I was almost joining in the conversation with the people upstairs (they were not being loud in any way) and if there was someone below me (I was on the 1st floor), then it would have bee the same for them. ZERO noise reduction between the rooms. Towels in the bathroom were desperately old and stunk of chemicals (i know they have to clean them, but I nearly passed out at the smell). Breakfast - I know that it is really difficult to cater for a large amount of people for breakfast, but the food was a disgrace. It was a grease-fest of gartantuan proportions, fried eggs that had been nuked, bacon and sausages in need of perhaps more than 2% pork, scrambled eggs that can only be assumed to be scrambled eggs because it was breakfast time (better suited for a pigs dinner), hash browns that clearly contained anything but potato - and the usual durge of plastic supermarket sliced bread.  If this place is genuinely an AA 4 Star hotel, then it appears we have all been grinded down to accept turgid, belligerently hopeless quality as the norm.  One really good aspect - the bed was very comfortable - but then, one would hope that was the case, being a hotel. 
-2; Although the spa was good, the whole place is let down by its shabby, dated appearance. No air con, poor tv reception, lamps that have come straight out of the nineties and a shower that looks as though it was fitted at the same time.  The food was very poor. The vegetable enchiladas being one of the worst meals I have ever had the displeasure of eating. One would expect at least a hint of chilli in a Mexican dish. Instead it was a mix of what could best be described as tomato slop served up in a tortilla.  At £170 for a night without breakfast it is very expensive for what it is.  My advice, for what it is worth, try elsewhere.  
-2; I have wanted to go to this hotel since it opening as I am a great fan of Art Deco, I especially wanted to stay in the suite which is located in the old control tower.  Booking was a nightmare. I called the hotel and explained that I wanted to speak to someone who could describe to suite to me – every time, I was put through to Central Reservations who had no idea of the layout of the suite – the best they could come up with was “it must be good because it’s the most expensive”.  We arrived at the hotel at 15:20 to be told that the room was not ready (this being their top and most expensive suite!). When I asked from what time the room should have been ready I was told 14:00.  A 40 minute wait and we were given the key to our suite. The area is split level with a large hallway with bathroom and dressing room, which then leads to an elevated sitting and dinning area – the TV is on the wall opposite to the sofa, which has to be about 30ft away! It was very dark in this area so we switched the lights on, only to find 3 of the ceiling lights did not work. From here you walk down a staircase to the sleeping area which has a huge bed, second TV, mini-bar, additional seating and coffee table, plus doors which lead onto the roof terrace.  On switching the lights on in the sleeping area, we discovered another 2 bulbs out. Also everywhere had a thick layer of dust. I called reception and concierge arrived with replacement bulbs, and a cleaner arrived to dust.  Before booking we had read of the Executive Lounge with “free bar and canapés”. We headed into the Exec Lounge at about 6ish – not even the lights were on, let alone any sign of drinks or something to nibble. Another visit to Reception, and we were told that they would “get it set up” – we went out for 15 mins or so and when we came back the guy behind reception said “I’ve put a bottle or red and a bottle of white wine up there, but someone else has just gone up so if you need another bottle give us a call”. I asked about the canapés and was told “Oh, we don’t do them anymore”.  I went to the restaurant to book a table for dinner, to be told that because it was Sunday the restaurant was closed, but we could eat in the bar! Surely we should have been told that there was no restaurant service when we booked. We ended up ordering room service and eating in our room – my advice is to give the food a miss, we both ended up very ill that night.  After eating our dinner in our room, we noticed how cold it was, and attempted to reduce the level of the cool air from the air conditioning unit. We found this impossible. I telephoned reception, they told me that I had to set it to level 2 and then wait up to 20 minutes for it to take effect. 30 minutes later, we were sat in our coats because it was so cold. I telephoned reception again and concierge and the Night Manager attended – they advised that there was a fault with the air conditioning, and that they could not reduce the level of coolness, nor could they even switch it off!!!! However they did provide us with 3 electric oil filled radiators to counteract the a/c!  I did fill in the comment card, but never received any feedback.  Whilst this stay was a catalogue of disasters, the staff did everything that they could to help to rectify matters, so whilst I give the actual hotel 0/10 I do give the staff 9/10. 
-2; Stayed for one in late Nov. Tv not working in room.. finally repaired after 9pm! Air con not working so had to spend the night in a sauna at 30 degC. Did manage to get about 2hrs sleep. The booking was for 3 rooms and we had 3 different prices! Breakfast wasnt bad... Thats the only positive S Baxter 
-2; Not sure who decided to call this a Hilton hotel and charge Hilton rates for it. It feels old and in need of a refurbishment. Staff in the hotel were very helpful, Staff on the reservation phoneline were worse than useless. 
-2; Stayed as an alternative to a taxi for dinner and ballet. Lovely, welcoming staff but sadly a tired hotel. Small (Executive, I think) room with an over-bath shower only 5' high and unpleasant/unclean shower curtain. Elderly bed/mattress sagging in centre, causing a less than pleasant nights sleep, and a series of patched up cupboards (one of which may once have held a minibar?). In former years a reliable Leeds hotel for quality and cleanliness - now disappointingly less so. For £100 (exc breakfast), not the end of the world, but better and cheaper beds and baths to be found elsewhere in the city. 
-2; Stayed here for a night with a certificate I had earned as a marriott rewards member - overall I was underwhelmed by the experience.  First let me say I am no stranger to marriott - I'm a platinum lifetime member with nearly 1500 paid stays over the past 11 years and have stayed in most of marriotts UK properties so I sadly rate the property as less than average.  The building is in its own grounds, and most of this area is taken up with car parking - I can't help but think that they are missing a great opportunity to set up a nice seating area with access to the bar etc. Sadly the only outdoor seating area is next to the main entrance with views of the car park, and no table service. If you want to sit there and have a drink in the sunshine , you have quite a walk in through reception and into the bar to collect it yourself.  The lounge area is good, however lacked any character - the bar was empty and soulless when we arrived - later in the evening it was packed with a couple of large SAGA holiday parties which made it difficult to find a seat.  We instead opted to walk to a nearby pub - the Falkens nest - which had a very nice outdoor beer garden and an excellent range on its menu  The rooms are fine - standard marriott decor, but my biggest disappointment is the executive lounge - there is nothing in it ! The management have stopped serving breakfast and evening snacks, drinks etc which I find amazing as this once comfortable lounge stands empty and deserted.  Despite a previous review saying that the UK management team had made this decision , there is no such thing. Marriotts are franchises and its up to the general manager of the hotel to make such a decision and nothing to do with the broader marriott brand. It's the only marriott in the UK or for that matter Europe that I know that has a lounge and has done this.  Perhaps the management should remeber that their decision is impacting marriott's best, most frequent, highest spending and loyal customers, it's a lot harder to win new customers than retain existing ones . Who in business today would think that is a smart move ? 
-2;Based on our stay the only 4 star feature of this hotel is its location right by the water front and next to the Sandbanks to Studland ferry so it is a good place for watching boats. The hotel is large, tired, poorly run,understaffed (why when it is so busy do you only have one person on reception most of the time) expensive and very poor value for money. If you enjoy crowds and chaos at breakfast then this is the place for you. The breakfast room resembles the food area at Gatwick South Terminal on a busy summer's weekend, although at Gatwick it is usually worth queuing at Pret whereas at The Haven the breakfast offering is mediocre and not consistent with its 4 star rating.Our deluxe room with seaview balcony was well decorated but small and the bathroom was in miniature. The balcony was dirty. The photographs on the website are very misleading in that they make the rooms look much bigger. The mattresses and pillows are soft so if you like a medium of firm feel you will be disappointed. We asked for face flannels but were told tthat the hotel does not supply them. fridges are not standard in the rooms. We asked to move rooms but that was not possible as they were full although they did give us another pillow and put a wooden board under the mattress Clearly other visitors like The Haven more than we did and having now read many of the reviews there is a strong following amongst some of its clientele but not all of them.
-2; we where lucky that we had a large room, but some of our family had very small rooms & also noisy, they must have known about it because there are ear plugs provided. this is not a cheap hotel as the price of drinks and food is 1 big ripoff, we went outside to WEATHERSPOONS for our drinks and food, this place is only about 50yds to the right of the hotel 
-2; Went to London on an overnight sightseeing trip. Arrived at 11am to leave our bags so we could go out for the day. However the lady on reception advised that our room as ready which was a nice surprise.  The room was very clean and nicely presented however it was just far too small.  There was no room to put our case and it felt far too claustrophobic. Apart from the size there are no complaints. 
-2; Pluses - good location, friendly staff  Minuses - dated decor bathrooms in need of a refresh £10 per night to use internet in room (free in public areas!) £16.50 for the worst breakfast I've ever had in a hotel - when I complained at reception I was told 'very sorry to hear that, goodbye!' - not a satisfactory resolution!  Won't return here again 
-2;Room shabby but comfortable. Breakfast rubbish and 150 yds away in different building. I am allergic to fowl so they offered me lamb when I gave the reason. At the wedding meal the lamb arrived beautifully presented but with the same duck-based sauce all over it as the fowl eaters had. DOH! I did not make a fuss. I pointedly left muttering dog's abuse under my breath and went down the road to the Crown (excellent establishment).  The lawn where the wedding photos were taken was covered and I mean covered, in goose and peacock droppings. Impossible not to stand in them. Not for me. Only meeting family made it worth while.
-2; We checked into the hotel last Friday evening at around 6.45pm upon a recommendation.  The reception staff were surly and ambivolent. We asked for a deal as it was so late booking in only to be told we don't really do deals as people will expect the same price in the future..... The dutch lady on reception was cold and unhelpful although the porter tried to help but was way out of his depth. We were shown to a room that was just okay. Good point: it had ADSL internet connection.  The telephone didn't work in the room nor did the bathroom mirror light, the bathroom was grubby and the bedroom had stains on the celing from a water leak but apart from that....  The bar man was very good and the breakfast staff were very good and good food in the breakfast dining room.  The Spa area was excellent although we were never told about it on check in, we had to find it ourselves and only did so as we were leaving. The whole event was not too good and we would not return to this hotel. We reported our findings to the morning reception staff and she said she would pass on our comments to the GM and he would call us as he was busy when we checked out at 11.30am . She didn't and we are still awaiting a call or an apology from him some 3 days later.  They show all the signs of going through the motions but actually don't care and at £280 for a basic room or £210 after a hard fought deal I would have expected much better greeting and hotel quality.  My advice: don't go until their room standards improve, they must be living, in my opinion, on past glories. 
-2;" Room was fine. telephone didn't work and was never fixed.   Dinner £100 for 3, with wine was excruciatingly average and the service was limited to putting your food on the table. Breakfast is sitting there under hot lamps for ages until you eat it. Eggs were hard; bacon was undercooked. Staff were loudly and excitedly talking about something that had (for them) hilariously happened at 3 am, just around the corner. All I wanted them to do was to shut up and let me have my breakfast in peace. It is not a 4* hotel, it is a 3* hotel charging 4* prices. "
-2; The hotel and the staff are very pleasant, the decoration and the rooms were also clean too.  The standard of food was also very good, if a little bit over priced.  All that aside, my main concern was that my company had paid for the hotel and meals in advance - which included meals for a period of three days.  Despite this advance payment, the hotel insisted on taking a further full payment on my card to secure my stay in the hotel? It just doesn't make sense when a full payment had already been received in advance.  48hrs after checking out, the money has still not been paid back into my personal account!   All drinks were paid for separately, with meals covered from the company - so why take the money in the first place, and keep hold of that money long after the check-out.  It is bad business practice in my opinion - is this even allowed and can money be taken from an account for a period of time dictated by the hotel?  This would have been a higher score if it wasn't for the poor handling of my bank card/account.  Checked out on 8 Dec, still no return payment on 10 Dec.   
-2;"After a cliff walk, we called in here for lunch. A return visit after a few years. The setting, of course, remains idyllic and after days of torrential rain it was a delight to sit on the tiny terrace and enjoy some sunshine. We chose crab sandwiches in a creme fraiche dressing and a portion of fries. There was a long wait. Eventually some delicious looking crab sandwiches, a spray of salad and a few crisps arrived. The crab and dressing was delicious, the bread a little 'left over from yesterday'. As to the fries, a tiny portion arrived, all end pieces from the bag I think, and pale and undercooked. We sent them back for another try! Eventually another plate of 'home cooked fries' arrived. They were overlooked and swimming in fat. We couldn't touch them and the smell of grease was terrible. Naturally we were not charged, but for a hotel of this standard, not being able to serve decent fries is deplorable. When we arrived the owner/manager was at reception starring at a computer screen, on the way out, he was in the same position; no semblance of a greeting to his guests. This place should be excellent, it has all the ingredients, but failed badly."
-2;" We booked Hotel on location and looks ! It looks great inside and reception area.  However stay was spoilt by functions in ballroom going on past midnight (12.10) on both nights of our stay. Music was very loud on both nights. On the first night I rang reception at about 11.30, but could get no answer. When I spoke to reception the following morning there was really no apology at all. All she said was &quot;We are a hotel that does functions&quot;. I asked if there was an alternative room, further away from the ballroom, no was the answer, we have two function rooms so the noise was no better anywhere in the hotel.  In addition breakfast was shambolic, staff were pleasant but were run off their feet. many guests came to breakfast and found they had lay their own table ! Food items were constantly running out, one guest said to me it was like Fawlty Towers.  In addition I asked about lifts working well (as my wife had broken her ankle 4 months previous) and then found they had moved breakfast to the ballroom, this needed my wife to negotiate a flight of stairs ! So I would not recommend this hotel at all. "
-2; Needs a complete makeover. Bathroom door would not close, furniture and decor was very dated and dreary. Despite assurances that it was suitable for disabled, it most certainly wasn't. Stairs were steep and wide. My wife who is disabled couldn't use the shower during the 4 nights we were there, because there is no grab rail. The only thing that I found reasonably good were, the staff were very polite.  The best thing about our stay was the great breakfast 
-2;My wife booked the crown for a birthday surprise as we're eating at a the Artichoke over the road. We were both very dissapointed, the first room we were given was above the kitchen, we could hear everything. To be fair to the staff they did move us to another room which was ok, apart from the bathroom was completely tiled normally this fine if there is some form of heating in it. It was so cold that showering was unpleasant because it was cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey.  As we were out for lunch at the artichoke we decided in the evening to snuggle up with some room service. Not only did it take a while which is ok, when it arrived the order was wrong. So the staff said they would correct it, three minutes later the phone rings and they have run out of what we ordered. We agreeded a replacement and waited, when it arrived we were told there would be no charge for the room service due to the messing about.   Again this was acceptable, until the morning on check out when all the room service was on the bill.   All in all the Crown is off the mark for the prices they are charging, a lot of there problems are easily sorted. It could be a great place.   What a let down.
-2; great location to walk into the center of Birmingham, however the was dirty with lots of staining on the roof which was a disappointment as its not one of the cheaper hotels to stay in, the breakfast was good with lots of choices to choose from. 
-2; Location, Location, Location. Unfortunately the hotel is beat and needs a serious refresh. The bathrooms are not in working order and their idea of air condition is a water vapor fan. All that said - the hotel was over priced but its right next to Buckingham Palace. All the major attractions are in walking distance. 
-2; Used to be good but now horrible. Restaurant was a disaster. Lift hallway smelt of damp. Internet didn't work in lobby and business centre. Expensive because of location but other hotels nearby must be better. I will stay elsewhere in future. I have stayed here more than 30 times before on business I won't again. 
-2; I took my girlfriend and her mother here for a cream tea and was very disappointed. The sandwiches were ok, but the selection was limited, the scones were quite small and there was only one flavour of cake available, so not really a selection as advertised. Not woth the £20 per head we paid and even less so when you considered that it was a 50% deal with Groupon. 
-2; I always read reviews and tend take them with a pinch of salt and usually only submit review if its really good or really bad, this was really bad. Found on late rooms £119, thought no, this is a special occasion I'll ring hotel, going of the pictures, and see if they have better and I'll pay more, paid £162 after being told it was a preferred room, great i thought, special. Nope it was a name given to the type room level and wasn't much better than the Premier Inn, apparently they are bigger than std with a king size bed in fact was 2 singles pushed together, I felt ripped off. Planned to eat in the Michael Caine restaurant, but they weren't getting any more out me. Didn't get very far expressing my dissatisfaction at reception either. Would I recommend this hotel, NO, there are far more deserving hotels in Canterbury. And ABode look Hand Picked Hotels, thats hows it done. 
-2; about on a par with a Holiday Inn ! Very outdated inside, staff are good ! Extremely expensive at £155 per night !!! Charging £6.50 for a small glass of wine so take your own bottle to the room ! If you are seeing any quality at all, then stay clear ! 
-2; I previously reviewed this hotel, having stayed in one of the modernised, refurbished rooms on the ground floor and I still stand by that review.  This time, paying the same price, I checked in, thinking it'd be the same. Oh, how wrong I was. Not knowing that this hotel is only half-baked, this came as a very large disappointment. The room (on the 5th floor) was a wreck:  Shabby furniture with wallpaper ripped off the wall, stains on the towels, carpet, and duvet cover.  Carpet not attached to the floor by door Bed that felt like a trampoline but with the springs jabbing you. Dread to think how old it was. No plugs anywhere, except for, inexplicably, a US-style socket In general, just minging.   I couldn't wait to get out of there, which luckily is easy, as it's attached to the terminal. I was not asked how my stay was either, so I didn't get a chance to express my feelings. No matter, I'm just going to write to Hilton and let them know.  Recommendation: unless you can get one of the newer rooms, don't waste your money and stay at the (much nicer) new Premier Inn. 
-2; our stay was not very good.our breakfast poached eggs were forgotten until we asked again for them , my wifes dessert was dry and inedible. the only pleasure we got from the hotel was sitting in the bar area.we enjoyed the sightseeing and the shopping at stratford. the room we had was clean.but the pillows were very hard.we did not have a good stay.we felt the restaurant was understaffed. 
-2; We have just returned from a five night stay and found this hotel in desperate need of a good spring clean to say the least. Room was ok but did not expect to find the kids pull out beds to have a sheet and blanket and no duvet. The lovely girl on reception sorted this out straight away and could not have been more helpful. The amount charged is not value for money and a 4 star hotel should be of a much higher standard than this. The pool temperature is acceptable if you are a polar bear. And breakfast not even worthy of a mention. Over all not very good. But York is lovely and well worth a visit as there are loads of things to do for adults and kids. 
-2; We stayed Saunton Sands, due to one of our best friends were getting married here and we thought due to its location, which is spectacular we would stay for the ease with the wedding and enjoy the stunning view, we booked a sea view room and were not disappointed with the view. The service on arrival and at breakfast the next morning was spot on, also service from the terrace bar was absolutely fine. The breakfast was plenty and seemed nicely cooked. The room was of good size and clean, but we have stayed in better hotels for a lot less than we had to pay for one night here. What really dissatisfied me was we bought two drinks from the terrace bat, then 1 hour later bought the same drinks from the bar were the wedding evening reception was and found out the drinks cost more! Also who charges £1.05 for a soda water? Another guest of the wedding reception who was not staying at the hotel tried Toby drinks from the terrace bar was refused and directed to the reception bar! So only stay here if you have loads of money! 
-2; I booked this to coincide with a football game. When I went to my room it looked very classy and spacious. After that it went downhill. If I had slept in the football stadium during the match it couldn't have been worse than the room I was given. If I wasn't woken up by the noise coming from the bar below (it wasn't boisterious just normal bar atmosphere) it was the annoying drone of a generator or something similar in the corridor outside or the staff preparing for the next day. I had a burger and chips for nearly £20 which must have been the type you microwave in a box - one half of the bun was hard the other soft. Needless to say I skipped my pre-paid breakfast. The receptionist at check-out didn't ask anything in relation to the stay. Why start the day at the wrong end of a guest's unhappiness. 
-2;" Although the location is good being just off the M4 the rest of my stay was poor. I arrived into an underground carpark which was nearly full and exceptionally small spaces. It was a dull concrete affair with no spaces due to the fact that a lot of people use the gym facities. I had pre-booked a Club room which was a wise thing as when I arrived the advertised rate for this room was £210 excluding breakfast. I did not pay this amount but did pay just over £100. The club room does come with a varient on continental breakfast but this was inferior. The hotel was dismal,l the hotel reception understaffed and not that polite. I checked in and went to my room which was at best old fashioned and worst a 2 star hotel, you have to remember these were the best rooms excluding suites. I phoned reception about the TV but received no answer so went down so ask. My question was about the movie channels which I did not seem able to receive. It was no surprise to reception as these had been switched off years before. I decided to order room service which came very quickly, the reason being it was not that hot and very poor quality so I decide not to eat it. As no movies reception told me I did have free WiFi which I thought I would use. It was so slow it took me back to dial up days. The bathroom was dated and the &quot;power shower&quot; was lacking the power.  I will not be staying here again "
-2; In February I stayed here with my other half as part of a birthday surprise, I had not heard much about this establishment but when we arrived we checked in and the main entrance looked very grand although the reception area is small it looked clean. We were advised how to find our room which was located at the new end of the hotel but trying to find the room was like doing the Krypton Factor!!   As part of the pack we had the deluxe room and a bottle of wine in the room as part of the pack, it was clear that this was cheap house red wine but part of the pack non the less.  The room certainly was not a deluxe room while it was nice the bathroom could have done with a good scrub around the tile grout, the curtains in the corner of the room did not fit the corner Window so this let light in.  While exploring the hotel we found the the lights were covered in dust and looked dirty around the lift area not what should be expected from a 4* hotel.  The restaurant was nice and the food was ok, as part of our pack we had food included but we were really surprised by the amount of extras that we had to pay for as supplements on top of what we had included, this was disappointing. The food itself was ok but nothing that I would expect from an AA recommended restaurant it certainly did not set the world on fire, the chicken pate was limited on flavour so don't expect the food to blow you away.  We also used the spa facilities which were ok the steam rooms were clean enough, but the pool itself needs updated as you could see cracked paint in the centre of the beams over the pool.  We used the spa treatment which I have to say was very good the staff were great.  We also had high tea which is one of the worst things I have experienced, I can only say to anyone who would consider this is DON'T the high tea came out and the sandwiches were tiny, the scones were dry and it was clear that the scones had been placed in a microwave for 10 seconds to try and freshen them up truly shocking. My recommendation for a wonderful high tea would be find somewhere else!!  This whole hotel/spa is overpriced for what it is, this establishment is not up to the standards that I would associate with a 4* hotel. 
-2; Booked this hotel whilst working in london just because it had free parking, if only this was true!  There was very limited parking and if you couldnt get parked then there was no parking for miles and to top it off they were having there xmas staff party who took up all the parking leaving none for guests which i thought was disgraceful.  The part of the hotel we stayed in was very smelly like it hadnt been cleaned properly for a long time. 
-2;We stay regularly at many of the Birmingham hotels when we're back visiting friends or out in the city. The Marriott was booked expecting the 'superior' room to be just that, unfortunately this place is jaded, dated and bland. Check in is performed in a totally perfunctory way, no different to what you'd get at a travelodge.  The room was.... Bland! I felt grey just spending time in the room. All fixtures were really dated, the sofa was in bad condition, springs broken etc. No wifi available, only cabled paid for Internet. Bathroom was sparse, with a clear window to the outside with dirt and dead flies in the double window void.  Would not return. The recently refurbished crowne plaza is far far better, du vin, if you like the slightly heritage style beats it and even the getting-scruffy Malmaison is an improvement on this place.  The one positive is that the small self service breakfast selection was good.
-2;" I stayed on a Sunday night for just one night and had to be in the Ealing area. Hearing my collegues' complaints from the many assorted B&Bs in the area they had chosen, I probably made the right choice. Let me say from the outset that though this is a typical chain hotel, the staff were pleasant and the room was clean. I also echo that the location suited me perfectly but being so close to Ealing Common station is would be suitable for a wider area too.  My only gripes were: Heating was useless (the radiator badly needed bled), TV picture was pretty poor, I ordered a pannini to my room as the restaurant was really quiet and after a second telephone call, it arrived in 90 minutes. &quot;New chef&quot; I was told. If he can't do a pannini, thank goodness I didn't order a meal!  My only real worry was that I went down for breakfast in the morning (good selection but the usual lukewarm buffet selection that is so prevalent in these hotels) and returned to prepare to check-out to find my room completely cleaned and ready for the next guest - this despite my not having checked out and all my belongings still in the room! This is a first for me!! I've heard of keen housekeepers but this one didn't contibute to my feeling very welcome. "
-2; Stayed at the sands 3weeks when we was travelling round south coast nice new place nicely done but thought over priced for what you got staff was not very helpful and everything felt to much 4 them would not recommend to friends or family not because of the but because of staff 
-2; attended a wedding reception at Crewe Hall we found the security staff for no valid reason intimidating and most unfriendly towards residents/guests , also bar staff in need of basic training. I would add the reception staff at Crewe Hall are vey welcoming. Could not recommend holding a party or an event at this venue due to the attitude of security staff. 
-2; The hotel has recently been refurbished so I would expect everything to be excellent, especially for a top price centrally located hotel. However, when we returned to our room after our evening out, the room was absolutely freezing. The air conditioning was supposed to warm the room up, but was extremely noisy, so we could not get to sleep with it switched on. The duvet was too thin (clearly a summer quilt) and the hotel had not provided any spare blankets in the wardrobe. What is worse, the hot water took over 15 minutes to come through. Clearly they have not installed a circulating hot water system, which is surprising given the recent refurbishment. In the morning the fire alarm went off around 10am. False alarm. I attempted to go to the gym. However, key card would not let me in. When I complained about all this at reception, they did give me a partial refund. It seems the reason I could not get into the gym was because I have to sign a document beforehand. Why do they not ask if a guest wants to use the gym. Clearly we do not know about silly rules until after they have made us annoyed us. Overall, we slept very little and were both in grumpy moods the next day. Not an experience I want to repeat! 
-2; We have stayed here several times in the last few years to visit family and I find it hard to believe that this hotel is described on some sites as 4 star. It is no better than 2 star. Rooms are basic and small, beds are small and old.  Breakfast is ok but over priced. Do not book here unless you are stuck. Do not be fooled by the nice photographs of the grounds, the rooms are more like a boarding school. 
-2;" On arrival i was allocated a smoking room, when i requested a non smoking room i was told the hotel was fully occupied and offered a free breakfast as &quot;compensation&quot; and an apology. The room was smelt disgusting and that was complemented by a dreadfully uncomfortable bed.... what a joyful experience...NOT!!! "
-2; Hotel was reasonable, prices of food & drink some what high, Parking was not the cheapest.. my car was badily damaged and no one took responsibilty... THINK TWICE ABOUT PARKING... reaaly bad experience 
-2;A generous two stars, the second on the insistence of my wife who felt that being kept awake all night by drunks staggering home after a saturday night out and people in the room above seemingly doing running on the spot for an hour beginning at 7am, made a nice change from me keeping her awake snoring. It would be a nice hotel for a weekend break if you live on a deserted and tranquil hillside in mid-wales and wanted to be close to humanity for a change but otherwise make sure you pack your earplugs if you plan to stay.  We were in the Ranworth suite, probably one of, if not the most expensive room in the hotel, which turned out to be on the first floor at the front. We were witness in the small hours to 'Debs' dumping her neanderthal neck tattooed boyfriend in a drunken brawl, then woken at 7 by what seemed like a wooden legged, weak bladdered, bath obsessed couple who liked watching early sunday morning religious programmes. The one noise we had hoped to hear, which we sadly didn't, was the Cathedral bells on what was after all a sunday morning. Don't they do that sort of thing any more or were they drowned out by people going to breakfast.  The breakfast was excellent and the staff friendly but over all, disappointing.
-2; The room itself was ok, however the double glazed window was broken and a metal bolt was attached to work as a fastener. This was a little dangerous (the handle was also removed) and did not offer soundproof or draft proofing. However, I was moved to write this due to the staff at the hotel. Retuning around midnight on Christmas Day, I was confronted by the receptionist who not only asked for my room number, but demanded to see my room key. As a paying guest (and member or this particular hotel group) I was surprised to be challenged like this. I have never been stooped by any hotel before to prove that I was a guest mid way through my stay - and I was completely offended and taken aback by this. His tone was accusatory, as though he didn't believe we were guests and because of this I shall never return again.  On checking out in a hurry at 4.30am I was also surprised to see the same receptionist trying to charge us for breakfast each day (which we never had) however due to the issue he had compensated us (£4.95) for the coffee we owed. This 10 minute delay was frustrating as it made us late when leaving so early in the morning. 
-2;We stayed 2 nights and the hotel was generally fine (acceptable for a 4 star hotel attached to an international chain). However I have a major caveat with this hotel in that the beds were extremely soft. For anyone with back problems they are impossible to sleep in (I was more comfortable lying on the floor). When we enquired we were told all the beds were the same and that the mattresses were new. 
-2;You hate it when a trusted friend does something that hurts or makes you very sad. You find it difficult to explain and really want to keep it to yourself in case your friend finds out and starts disliking you too. Welcome to the Premier Inn, Old Trafford. The location, car parking facilities and the consistent warm welcome on entering makes you completely at ease.  The Hotel is currently being updated to, no doubt, the very highest standards you come to expect from Premier Inns. Our room has yet to be afforded that privilege so it looks tired, uninviting but most important, was clean and well serviced. Regretfully the heating made the room so very hot and because the glazing fails to shut out any noise, the experience was not great. The noise was compounded by blaring Disco beat and the beer coolers from the pub opposite working long hours, oblivious of our need (and the people next door) to have some sleep. Groggy from a lack of sleep, we went to Breakfast. Greeted by a lady with no name badge who demanded our kitchen orders even before we sat down was not a great start. The soft poached eggs requested arrived hard and before the porridge! When I politely queried this, I was given a quizical look as though this is the way they serve food. Nobody checked on us throughout. On clearing the table, I again mentioned why I left the Porridge, all to no avail nor apology. So here is my apology...I am really sorry Premier to have to report this and I hope, as I am still your friend, you will still be my best friend too.
-2;" This hotel was booked for me by a work colleague at our agreed corporate rate. On arrival check in was fine and everything was ok till I realise that my room was up a couple of very narrow flights of stairs all the way up to the top of the house, no lift and no disabled room!!! In the room, the bed almost touched the wall on three sides. In the bathroom was the most ridiculous &quot;over bath&quot; shower I have ever been in. I had to crouch down to even fit under it, no way I could use it. The flat screen tele mounted on the wall was so high up that I had to sit up high, on a pillow, to be able to see it and I could not view the screen when lying down. The corporate rate was excessive, considering our usage and I have never stayed there since, even though I have practically lived in hotels in this area since that visit! "
-2; Came here last week on business. Im in Birmingham approx 3 times a year and stay here or the Belfry and have done for a few years now.  I called reception to advise there seems to be dogs barking (it was around 9:30pm). I didnt want it to go on all night. They seem to be aware of the dogs and suggested it was a resident that lived on site, they assured me they would stop around 9:45pm. At 4 am I awoke to the dogs barking again it went on for over an hour. I even took a recording on my phone of the dogd.I had a rubbish sleep. In the morning I mentioned it and the staff seem to brush over the subject and didnt offer any sort of apology or discount.  The breakfast seemed vert dry and the mushrooms didnt seem fresh, they were very odd. The fried eggs were extremely overcooked too.  Im not wasting my money here again as I didnt get a full nights sleep or a good breakfast and paid for this! 
-2; Staff were excellent 209 if great as a family room nice and big with separate sleeping areas. Room needs refurbished. The room appeared to directly above the function suite making sleep impossible until 12:30am 
-2; Stayed three nights great deal at £15 love the place but there is always something not quite right this time the first day we arived workmen were using a stone cutting machine Causing dust and noise also at the other side of of us workmen we're digging a trench to lay pipes on the second dayof of our stay the workmen workmen cut through a cable leaving us without power for the afternoon! When we booked we should have been informed of the amount of work been carried out! Stayed here four times never had a perfect visit but not a lot to get it right keep working on it! 
-2; Arrived for a conference near by at around 12 in the day, very grumpy staff. In the evening we asked for details of where abouts to eat in the city, very grump staff, they told us to go round the corner to a cafe (didnt look too good) or use the hotel facilities. Hadn't been to Manchester before so was a little shocked at the lack of the usual northern welcome! Tried to order room service later on, took 1 hr to arrive. Check out, very grump staff. Building has potential (even though its a bit souless) but there is a serious morale issue with the people who work there which makes me think it is a very badly run and snooty business. 
-2; Three of us went to tortworth court for christmas day lunch 2016. My main meal was luke warm when it arrived so I sent it back the next one that arrived was just as bad which I kept as I didn't want to complain again as it wasn't the waitresses fault. When the coffee arrived that was luke warm and so strong we couldn't drink it so we left. I looked for someone senior to make a complaint but no one around. I emailed straight away and got an email back saying they were sorry and I should of complained about the second meal (so it's my fault now ) and they hoped I had a good Christmas. When you are paying £79 pounds per person you expect a great meal and if this isn't the case it should be rectified. Will never go again it spoilt our Christmas. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE 
-2; I only stayed here for business as hotels in Crewe were all fully booked. The grounds and hotel itself is fairly pleasant. The rooms are quite nice, but the door handle fell off my bathroom and was left lying on the floor when I arrived back the following evening. The pool is of a decent size and there are two saunas, two steam rooms and an ice room. So far so good. I was checked in by a sullen girl who didn't even acknowledge me when I arrived as she was on the phone. The restaurant was staffed by inexperienced and ineffective young men. Service was not particularly quick. I didn't bother with breakfast as it was extortionate at £17.95. Check out took 15 minutes due to a problem with the bill - for which there was no apology. The private road leading out was quite slippery (not icy) so take care! 
-2; Booked into Baileys and ended up in their sister hotel next door, the Millennium Gloucester. Tired dated hotel where everything needs attention. room very poor 8 bulbs broken, curtains don't close properly, towels worn out, shower head blocked up, cheap divan base the mattress was ok to be fair,cottons all have had the life washed out of them. Windows filthy. They charge for wi-fi £10 per day. Good points, door men were excellent, barman had all the chat although the wine list by the glass is poor. 
-2; Great rooms, spacious enough. Pity the bar staff didn't realise other guests or than those attending the wedding would require assistance.   I'd of complained had I thought it was worthwhile.   Value for money was it's best attribute!!   Room service was our only option to grab a snack. Shame because bar & lobby were nice. 
-2;" Granted, the staff were friendly and the girl on reception was particularly nice and welcoming at check-in. The lady who ran the bar was also very pleasant even though she appeared to be working very long hours! Oh, and the bed was very comfortable! But that's about where the positives end! The place was totally soul less even though there appeared to be a wedding going on! The bar was way too bright and could have done with some music, any music! The room was smelly upon arrival although that did dissipate after a few hours (or we simply got used to it!). The rooms are tired plus ours had noisy heating and a drafty window that didn't shut tight. More &quot;Crossroads&quot; than Best Western - for those of you old enough to remember! "
-2; Not a great stay at this hotel. I noticed some things that definitely need to improve.. 1. The smell of bleach when I first walked in was overpowering 2. Some of the wallpaper near the window was peeling off - could easily be fixed. 3. There were no towels at all in the bathroom. 4. The throw on the bed was covered in brown stains - needs to be replaced. 5. The bathroom tap was either off or suddenly on full blast and scolding hot, not good when you don't have any towels to dry your clothes with after you get splashed. 6. The breakfast could do with a couple of more veggie options like veggie bacon or sausage.  A couple of things that did redeem this place was the low price and free wifi which do come in handy on a short trip.  All in all the hotel is not bad but could do with a few improvements. 
-2; I've Been meaning to post a review on Pendley Manor but have prevaricated unecessarily...  I've stayed at this Hotel 3 days per week from September last year to March this year and I must admit the Hotel is way overpriced for what it has to offer...I don't know where to start from...I couldn't have had a descent shower from most rooms as the water pressure was almost non existent meaning it took me ages having a shower every morning...there are some rooms that have been recently decorated and a bit modernised but MOST Rooms haven't!.The Bar Prices are absolutely ludicrous and were raised by a further 10%, at Xmas-To give you an idea a pint of basic European Beeri costs £5.50! I paid these sorts of prices whilst in Brussels and Venice to be honest and this hotel is nowhere nearer a big city!  The elements that are good are the cleanliness,the staf,it's variety/ quality of breakfast and surrounding grounds/gardens...  It seems that the Greedy owner of this hotel (it seems to be owned by an individual) do not have the descency or the moral Filotimo to pass anything of value for money to the average guest..  The only reason I kept on stopping there all that time was due to the excellent location it had to the company I was working at the time.To be frank, the stay per night only should be in the region of £50-60 per night, tops!  The roooms to AVOID BY ALL MEANS are in the centre of the Hotel and they are 114-116 , 107-112 and 201-209.  I don't want any reply by the management of the Hotel, as I have stopped there for many nights and they all know about these issues which I've consistently mentioned to them,time and time again...  Thx A. 
-2; Arrived at hotel and met by concerge.Car keys handed over and proceed to check in.So far so good.After two nights we go to check out just before 10.00 am.Reception busy and we check out at 10.11am and request car.10 minutes we are told and please take a seat.Reception seating consist of one sofa and numerous people so we stand patiently.After 20 mins we enquirer about car.On its way we are told.10 mins later we ask again.On its way we are told.55minutes it takes for car to appear and for this service we were expected to pay £18 per day.Dissapointed is an understatement.Valet parking at this hotel cannot be recommended. 
-2; We stayed here for a party being held locally. First impressions, good. Had parking out the front, staff very helpful, room ready early so we had time to walk into town and have lunch. Double room very small (the chair in the corner by the bed meant we had to shuffle across). The room itself was smart though basic. The bathroom, WOW, but not in a good way. Clearly this has been missed in any refurbishment, dated and poor quality fixings, taps the cheapest possible and scuffed and worn, shower would be low rent for a B&Q value offering, I haven't seen a toilet seat like it since my student days (1970s).  At least I thought it was clean but.... the air vent was full of hair and fluff and didn't extract well as a result, the only saving grace was it tried to suck air out, had it been reversed I would need a hazmat suit and not a towel. Room extremely warm and air con not working, the box was there on the wall, a light came on then off, clearly it was teasing me at 1 in the morning.... Windows open and relatively quiet outside until the music started from the Gym in the morning so we got up and fled the scene of the crime, heavy in spirit but lighter in wallet.  Value, woeful, no breakfast included, charged me £8 for parking my car and all this for £240 for one night. Ouch....! Next time tis a travel lodge for me in that location. 
-2; For our trip to the Isle of Wight last month my wife pre-selected several hotels as possible place to stay. The first that we came to was the Caprera “Hotel” - plaase note the use of quote marks. We arrived outside, looked inside, then left to look elsewhere.  May I immediately say that in no way, particularly as not having stayed there, am I able to comment let alone judge the standards of food and service – but I can definitely say that the Caprera is not in any stretch of the imagination a HOTEL as it obviously lacks not only in size but also in the facilities that are expected by that term.  If you want a Bed & Breakfast or a Guest House then the Caprera is in all probability as good, maybe even better, than most of it’s competitors – but to term itself a HOTEL is not fair even to itself let alone it’s potential customers! As a B&B it quite possible deserves high marks, but as it is said to be a hotel my marking is as a hotel. 
-2;" The hotel appears to have been recently refurbished - this means they've removed the baths which is a shame, but the big shower room is good and the baths were previously quite small!   The refurb is nice - dark furnishings and high standard finish. Large plasma tv, comfortable bed, good and simple to use broadband connection.   However, the staff lack any concept of customer service at all, and seem to be generally rude and unwelcoming. When commenting on the lack of lifts, I was told that &quot;there's only one working and I ain't calling them out tonight it'll cost a fortune&quot; - breakfast costs £16.96 in this hotel - but you can't get from one floor to the next without waiting half an hour for the lift!  Nice, provided you don't want anything other than a bed! "
-2; About 50 of us went there for our Christmas meal (22/12/12) The aim of this hotel is to take as many bookings as possible,charge you a high price £30,rip you off for drinks when they get you in. HAPPY CHRISTMAS SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT YEAR,,,,I DON'T THINK SO.. I'd have been more grateful paying for a jumped up price at a Crown Carvery than paying for that nite up there. Will they get our custom next crimbo,I don't think so 
-2; Upon arrival we had to get them to come and clean the room in particular the body hairs that were in the sink, bath and around the tiles and yes there was plenty!! We were woken up at 7.15am on the first morning by the crashing and banging of deliveries to the hotel from goods vehicles. The second day we were woken up earlier at 5.00am by the alarm clock that had been set????(not by us!!) got back to sleep to be woken again by deliveries at 7.00am!! There was no complementary water in the room even though this was part of the room deal. The bar staff were very rude when we asked for a refund on a glass of wine which we thought was poor quality she refused and said that was what we ordered ! so we had to get the manager to sort it which he did. On check out we told the manager about the issues and she offered us free parking to compensate us! after a lot of banter she gave us one night free stay and a bottle of water. NEVER AGAIN! S.Daniel Sheffield 
-2; There is absolutely no excuse for not cleaning a room properly. Except here, apparently they were fully booked the day before, so it was a bit manic, that was the response I had at checkout when I informed them of my dissapointment! The hotel is 2 star, no more, certainly not worth a room rate at the level I paid through booking.com. The restaurant was very cold, the food quality and presentation was (very) basic pub standard. Now back to the room, Im about to get into bed...noticed long black hairs on a Pillow and in the bed, gstains on the quilt cover and the bed sheet, now I'm not queemish and I don't mind kipping under the stars when I'm camping or fishing, so I'm not one to pack up my bags and demand another room at 11pm , that's just more hassle and when you're looking forward to some sleep......, so a re make of the bed meant that said issues were at least now on the opposite side of the bed. A reasonable nights sleep. A quick glance of the Bathroom in the morning confirmed that the room had not been cleaned properly at all. Quite disgusting really. Do I hope they take these issues seriously ? ..absolutely,.... would I go back or recommend it ? Absolutely not. 
-2; Nice room but please do not stay here if you want customer service as they do not know what it is - staff on duty at reception were poor and I had to negotiate my way past six members of staff before I could get my breakfast 
-2;"Stayed here as it was near the &quot;NEC&quot; and we were seeing &quot;Mrs Brown's Boy's.&quot; We found it one of the more expensive &quot;Hilton Hotels&quot; that we have stayed in, not so much the price of the rooms as you expect that sort of price to be near to your venue, by the time you pay for your car parking, food and a drink you well have doubled you room bill."
-2; I stayed at the Strand Palace last night on business and wouldn't recommend it at all.   I was booked in to a King Room 'Without a View' - the website explaining that they have scaffolding up and therefore the view out of the window was scaffolding. No problem, I thought, I'm in town on business, I'll only be sleeping and making the odd call from the room. What they fail to mention is that the whole floor I was on was under construction. There are dust sheets everywhere, drilling and banging from 8AM to 5PM and while I am no health and safety expert, the taped over fire alarms didn't fill me with confidence.   In addition to being allowed no lie and not being able to make business calls due to the drilling, the walls are also paper thin. So when the person in the room next door decided to watch Kirsty and Phil at 5AM, I felt like they were in my room.  Breakfast was an OK, if uninspiring event. Perhaps it would have been better at a table that wasn't right next to and facing the toaster.  I told the receptionist on checkout about the above issues and he wasn't particularly interested. All in all a poor experience. There are so many good hotels in London and it's so easy to find good deals with Trivago and TripAdvisor, I find it hard to imagine why anyone would choose this hotel. 
-2; We attended a wedding reception here on 21st Feb 2015, the function was of an ok standard, although the bride did attend the night before and relaid the table herself as no attention to detail had been given, dirty white linen cloths, table cloth points not level. The room was of a comfy sort, although brokers tiles were in the shower room. The worst thing was the breakfast on the 22nd, we arrived at approx 8.15 and we were seated quite quickly, the waitress returned with our coffee and took our order, we then sat there for 40 mins we then asked where our breakfast was to be told by the waitress she would check, SHE NEVER EVEN RETURNED. Now getting annoyed I approached a waiter who disappeared into the kitchen, I stood and waited at the kitchen door, he was at least five mins, when he reappeared he looked shocked to see me still there, he said oh it will be about tens mins, I asked to see the restaurant manager. He duelly arrived (still no breakfast) and asked if we had been waiting long!!! After a short discussion he disappeared and five minutes later our breakfast arrived, of poor quality. Me and my wife left. On paying they had deducted £15 from the bill. £15 will not get me the wasted 50mins of my life back. Some people were leaving as they had waited so long. 
-2;This is a good hotel to spend one or two nights. Is a bit far away from manchester. I found the receptionists (both females) very rude.   I spent three times in this hotel because it has a very good value and rooms are very good. However, last time we got up early enough to have a nice breakfast and when we arrived to the restaurant they told us to pay £19 per person for the breakfast. Who pay such a money for a holiday inn breakfast. Of course we walked off and we have a proper nice breakfast in another 4 star hotel near for 10 pounds
-2;"Having been regular family visitors to Kilworth House and Theatre over the years my father was keen to celebrate his 80th birthday at the hotel. His birthday coincided with the start of the Christmas programme, the show was the Rat Pack - Dad';s favourite performer Frank Sinatra, so it was all coming together great. We booked 8 months in advance and counted down the days. What a disappointment! Eight of us booked for the evening and stayed the night. I couldn't agree with Chloe366 comments more, ever word is true. The food wasn't great, the show extremely disappointing. We attended on the 28th November I can assure everyone that there wasn't a standing ovation on the night we went. The show was lacklustre, lacking in originality and at just 55 minutes long poor value for money. Most of the tables in our vicinity looked bored up until the last song &quot;New York, New York&quot; when things looked like it was really going to get going, only to finish immediately. Show finish 10.15am, nothing on afterwards, no music played or further entertainment provided.   We tried to raise these concerns with the Management on the night but were told that a Duty Manager would not be available until Monday morning. The breakfast team told us that three other groups had also complained about the previous nights show. I subsequently sent an email raising my concerns to the hotel management only to receive the same dismissive response as Chloe366 - &quot;it's only you, everyone else is happy&quot;. Well, no they are not!   In case you are wondering we are not serial complainers. Like most people it takes a lot before I complain but in this instance the money spent to value received made it necessary. Previously we have always been very happy with our visits."
-2;" Booked on late rooms, this was still a reasonably expensive stay. The accommodation is in annex wings; like a military mess or an upmarket hostel (it is/was the civil service college). Rooms are a little walk from the car park, so not the best if you have limited mobility. Dinner in the restaurant was a 'buffet' but only in the sense that we served ourselves; it's not an all you can eat. After dinner coffee is free, but it is help yourself from a machine, using paper cups.   The first night was quite quiet, good sleep. However, the site has a conference centre, hosting some sort of prayer meeting. The only way to keep the room cool was to have the windows open, however, this allowed in the noise of people talking until after 2330, constant cigarette smoke. The people using the conference centre appeared to have little regard for other guests. Not an enjoyable night's stay.   Breakfast was good, £10 per person if booked at reception in advance. Staff friendly, but don't stay here if you want peace and quiet. On our 2nd night we did ask reception to ask the noisey congregation (same group all weekend) at the conference centre to be quiet but the noise continued.  Rooms are fairly spacious but are outdated and lack any character. The rooms would only really be suitable for weeknight stays and preferably if you was at the conference centre with work! "
-2; We stayed for one night at the Copthorne Hotel on a business trip. The hotel has a nice feel to it when you walk in with a large, neat looking lobby and decent parking out front. Unfortunately, our stay was beset by problems form beginning to end. As it's easier to list them, I'll do so.  1. When we checked in we were told we had a standard room only rate even though we had paid for dinner, bed and breakfast. To their credit they agreed that we should have what we paid for, but it seems that the hotel booking system isn't very reliable.  2. Similar to above, we had booked a deluxe double room with a view over the quay. We arrived into a tired room with an odd pull-down bed (as you'd find in a bedsit), a badly fitted carpet (it kept rucking up) and a sofa with some dubious looking stains on it. The room view was overlooking the car park and Trafford Road rather than the quay. Upon going back down to reception to complain, we were quickly offered a new room with a quay view. However, this was a twin room as they apparently has no double rooms left even though we had reserved one.   3. As part of the dinner rate included in our booking price, we ate from the three course set menu in the hotel restaurant. We were advised to book a table as they were very busy. We had to queue for 10 minutes to do so with several other customers waiting to be seen to, even though several tables appeared to be free. When we came down for dinner later on, the waitresses were friendly and polite, but a bit unprofessional (e.g. shouting at each other across the restaurant) and very slow. The food took a long time to come out (even though it was a set menu) and we were in the restaurant for around an hour and a half in total (most of it waiting). The food was reasonable.  4. The in-room kettle must have been faulty as when boiled the handle (plastic) turned red-hot and I was only able to pick it up using a hand towel. This would obviously be a concern if someone was to try and handle kettle without knowing of the problem. We reported this when we left and were told that maintenance would look into it.  5. We were woken up at 8am by a staff member knocking on the door to deliver a breakfast that we never ordered. The staff member in question was adamant that it was being delivered to the right room (even pointing to the number on the door). However when I was shown the order form, it was not under our name. Although 8am does not seem that early, my fiance had been working until 4am and we were hoping to take advantage of the hotel's 12pm checkout. The staff member was apologetic, but there had obviously been some organisational issues somewhere.  6. When we went down to breakfast were told that it would not be included in our room rate (even though we had sorted this out the night before with reception staff - see above). We were seated quickly and the food and service were both fine.  7. Upon checking out we were told that we would have to pay for breakfast, even though we had been through this twice before, and it the same receptionist who had dealt with us previously. This was again quickly sorted out.  Overall, I think that the hotel suffers from a poor booking system where getting what you want is a bit of a gamble, and some organisational issues. To the credit of the staff they did sort out our problems quickly but I've never stayed at a hotel where I've had to try and resolve so many problems. The room was nice enough, but the bathroom was quite dates with rusty fittings and dirty/mouldy tile grouting. This is certainly not a 4 star hotel. 
-2; This is a hotel with delusions of grandeur. The fact is, it needs maintenance and an improvement in its bar service. The pool was really cold, there was peeling paintwork above ours head and locker doors in the changing rooms had actually been left smashed, with shards of broken wood sticking out. In the bar, £9 for a single gin and tonic? That's more than London prices and the barman couldn't even force a smile.  Its saving grace was its outstanding food in the restaurant. A good chef, but a poor hotel. 
-2; We were visiting the Buxton Festival for a couple of days and, for once, made the mistake of not checking Tripadvisor before booking because the location and hotel blurb looked good. We chose one of the 12 Premium rooms. It was stuffy, with creaky floor boards above and below with a billious carpet, bathroom with chipped enamel and vinyl wallpaper. Goodness knows what the ordinary rooms are like. I have now read the many recent comments from others rating this hotel poor or terrible and I do not wish to waste readers' time repeating things - We agree with everything negative that has been said. But I would endorse the serious restaurant problem - they know there is a problem because there is a tacky card displayed at the entrance with traffic lights(red,amber and green) suggesting times for customers to minimise queueing problems. Table layout wrong, the worst scrambled egg I have ever seen, and no breakfast after 9.30am ( or dinner after 9.30pm) and not a manager in sight. You know there's a problem when you arrive at the hotel and are greeted by two 'Naff' wedding breakfast table layouts in the Foyer to attract the function punters. We were awoken at 7.00am on one morning to the sound of two very noisy motor mowers attempting to mow the extensive steeply sloping lawns in the pouring rain! What kind of management allows that? For all of this I was charged an unbelieveable £177 a night ( B&B ). Was I surprised when a bar bill not incurred by me appeared on my bill when I checked out? The young staff on the desk were polite and helpful. Puma have just taken over this Barcelo property - they have a lot of work to do, and a lot of money to spend to justify a designation of 4 star. 
-2; I have stayed in this hotel countless times and I have encountered untold customer service problems. For some reason this hotel cannot get their charging to room process correct without embarrassing the customer. The only time I pre authorised a card they charged me £200 and when you don't they embarrass you at the till. Honestly I have never known such a huge chain to get it soooo wrong. The rooms are dated, food and drink expensive and when bar staff are rude it makes you wonder why you didn't stay in Premier Inn. The breakfast staff are always helpful but if you order porridge or poached eggs you may wait a while. All in all I don't know whether it's the hotels process or the staff knowledge of how it works but it really makes for poor service. If you are thinking of staying here and want a hassle free stay with accommodating staff look somewhere else there are plenty hotels in the area. 
-2; My gut feeling was to turn back from the entrance but we had a long journey to do and a young baby. Very poor value. Room had a view of the service road and trees and we were unable to open the windows.....to see and hear the planes form Bristol airport. Room was poorly ventilated and little evidence the air con was doing much. The king room was Lilliputian which meant the bed needed to be small. TV didn't work. Bathroom grouting was mouldy and falling off. Room service was terribly slow although there was a wedding reception and they had lost our order. Breakfast was stale and coffee awful. We would have been better off in B&B or a Premier Inn or similar...about the same as the cost of the breakfast. 
-2;" Don't stay here if there's a wedding going on! My wife and I, plus 3 other couples stayed here for a weekend (they used the spa, we played golf at a nearby course)..... things started ok - the rooms were perfectly fine...... the problems were around the service and of course the wedding reception that took place on the Saturday night. There is little sound insulation from the reception room.... our bedroom vibrated and we could hear every word of every classic disco song being played until 1am meaning we got little sleep. Having read past reviews, this is not a new complaint, so why the hotel would put non-wedding guests in rooms close to the reception is beyond understanding? Calls to the reception desk resulted in no improvement - the staff member even had the cheek to say &quot;don't take it out on me&quot;.  Other issues with this place are slow service - lunch, dinner, drinks - they all take forever! there's no excuse for this - the staff were unresponsive and seemed happy to accept that this is normal. They also seem incapable of getting their orders correct - one of our group had to wait an extra 20minutes for her main course as they got it wrong. Finally - if you want to use the spa facilities - note that they concreted over their jacuzzi - their material still advertises this, but it's not there. They also seem to have a lot of &quot;staff sickness&quot; for those staff undertaking spa treatments - our group booked treatments had to be rearranged due to unavailability of staff - I get the impression this another excuse and nothing to do with sickness as it seems to crop up very frequently in reviews. In the end we complained a lot - the ladies got free lunches and drinks for the lack of jacuzzi and messed up treatment times and we also got big discounts on the room bills due to lack of sleep - I'd have prefered to have the sleep, but at least they did something!  So my advice is to check if there's a wedding and ensure you get a room as far away as possible. Don't accept poor service - complain and demand compensation if you don't get what you expect. "
-2; Upon arrival we had to wait in the un-organised queue for reception for quite a while. Only 2 staff were working and neither of them had English as their first (second or third) language. Our reservation couldn't be found at first but eventually it was and we were allocated a room on the 3rd floor (Even though this hotel is in the UK, the floors are ground, second and third rather than ground, first and second). After a long walk along dirty corridors (liiter had been swept to the edge of the corridor but not removed) we entered the room which was dark (due to the tiny window) and was clean but very old fashioned with an old style TV. The sliding wardrobe doors wouldn't slide open and needed an almighty effort to get something in or out. The window view was over skips in the carpark with the prison-style detention centre dominating the view (it had larger windows than the hotel!). The bathroom door couldn't be closed (it didn't fit the frame) and the bathroom sink was cracked in many places. The lighting was dim and the towels were threadbare. A call to reception resulted in it not being answered for over 5 minutes. A second call was the same and the third call was picked up within a minute and I was put on hold without being spoken to. I gave up and went to reception (to queue up again) and was given another room. This had a non-cracked sink and better lighting in the bathroom. No spoons are provided for the in-room tea and coffee but they do give you plastic stirrers (like the ones in fast food places). I've never seen these in a 4 star hotel. Check-out took ages and the queue was once again disorganised. We had no problems with the Hoppa Bus which was quick and empty. 
-2; I have stayed at several Hotel du Vin hotels before and despite them being relatively expensive, I have been very happy.  Consequently, having booked the best suite in Hotel du Vin Brighton for a couple of nights I had high but realistic expectations. The room was very nice, and the two baths in the room was a unique feature, however whilst described as 'sea view' it is in a side street and therefore the scope is very limited. Although they do (literally) provide you with a telescope. So, you need to be aware of that before you book expecting to enjoy sights of the rolling sea....  .....However, what 'really got my goat' was their failure to address the finer issues for a hotel charging around £330 a night for their suite and advertising itself as a 4* plus. I was astounded that I had to call the reception to ask for a refreshment of the room's toiletries on day two and also there were limited towels and no slippers etc (I actually don't really go for slippers - but if you are going to have a selling feature of bath tubs in the middle of the suite then it might be wise).  Parking is a pain and a hike - something I hate about hotels as a rule - as it is rarely advertised and often a significant additional expense. Expect to pay around £25 a day to the those robbers 'NCP' who are known for peddling the most expensive parking in the world...  Expectation may have been high, but in reality, whilst still a nice hotel, I was very disappointed. 
-2; We have just returned from a 2 day break at this hotel. The location is great BUT the rooms that we were given were nothing like the pictures on the website. We were in London with friends and their room was no better. We are not usually one to write a bad report but this hotels bedroom are very tired. Our wardrobe was so small you couldn't hang up a shirt let alone anything longer. The heater was broken and we had a large hole under the carpet at the bottom of the bed (don't want to know what happened there). When we went to collect our cases that we had left in storage the man was very rude and complained about having to keep fetching cases all afternoon. The positive thing is the room and the bedding were clean and other staff were helpful. 
-2; The Hotel looked wonderful on line. The lounge areas had poor seating with no settees just very uncomfortable chairs. We were pushed into limited spaces due to a wedding which was not a problem but with no where else to sit for a drink we had no where quiet or comfortable to sit. At Dinner the dinning Hall was full and very noisy and wished we had gone elsewhere to eat. More like a giant eating trough than a 4 star hotel. Breakfast was a disaster. The Hotel obviously is unable to cope with the number of guests and the service was well below standard described for this star Hotel. Avoid this Hotel. The only saving grace was the porter on duty when we arrived. 
-2; just about perfect, stayed on 2 occasions, how can you get so much right and then get a luke warm shower, pretty poor when you are freezing after a game of golf for 5 hours to be told to have a bath instead this has happened twice, but not a third time thanks 
-2; Really disappointed. Poor service. Room was average but faulty fire alarms going off on consecutive nights. Once at 2:30am. On the plus side great location to Canary Wharf and using the free ferry was great. Had a family roaming ticket for the ferry going up and down the Thames. Beats the tube on a summers day 
-2;We stayed two nights here and on both nights were woken well after 2.00 am by smokers outside the bar yelling and shrieking at the tops of their voices. The management should ban outside smoking after midnight. The situation was not helped by the fact that the wooden window frames did not close properly. Also there was no screening on the windows which were overlooked by other bedrooms so the curtains could not be opened until we were dressed.  As part of the hotel's so-called ecological stance we were asked to place our used towels back on the rail if we did not want them replaced. Fine, except there was no towel rail, only the brackets for one. The pop-up waste in the wash basin did not pop up at all until I adjusted it myself. The flow control of what appeared to be a new shower fitting came away in my hand and the cheap plastic shower head did not match the other shower fittings. The tiles on the bathroom floor were also badly cracked in many places.  The lighting in the room was very poor being low energy bulbs which did little to illuminate anything. The standard lamp was so poorly maintained that it leaned at a very precarious angle. Also the kettle was of the old fashioned type with a direct connection not the safer lift off type with the connection in the base plate.  We have used Accor hotels in Europe and Australia and have found them to be very good but it looks as if this hotel has recently been taken over and may well be given a much needed makeover. I doubt very much if we will use this hotel again unless we can get a room very far away from the smokers door to the bar.
-2; My husband and myself stayed on 2nd May for a special birthday . We were given a single room with a small double bed , only accessable from one side,as it was against the wall at the other.We were right above the front door hearing it slam well into the small hours along with our neighbouring room who kept slamming his.think we need some quiet closers attached to themThe heating was on when we arrived but the following day it was off , and we found it quite chilly,the hot drinks tray hadn't been refurbished either the following day and we had to ask at reception for some. The restaurant was well run by. The metrudee , he does his job excellent. The gentleman serving in the lounge bar needs to take some tips from him. Tables were left with glasses and when he eventually decided to clear them rather than pick up things from the floor he just kicked it under the table.we were really looking forward to our stay at the hotel but it was very disappointing for a four star hotel, we have had better service in 3star hotels in fact the following night we made our way up to Darlington and the mollington banastre spa was not a patch on the hotel we stayed in that night. All the staff were a credit to them and I didn't have to crawl into bed from the bottom of the bed. We thought we might have got a reply from the hotel when we contacted them when we came back but that is three weeks and not a word from them. This just sums up there attitude to the guests 
-2; We stopped here for one night before travelling by Eurostar. When we booked we stipulated that we had a 9 month old baby and would be bringing a travel cot.   There was not enough space between the bed and the wall for the travel cot. We asked for a larger room, but were told the hotel was full. I ended up having to hold our baby all night, so a sleepless night. Not ideal!  The room was lovely, (if a little small-you about 6 inches between the end of the bed and the wall!) if we were travelling as a couple we would have had no complaints. Comfy bed, nice linen, beautiful bathroom.   If not for the travel cot issues, I would have no hesitation giving this hotel 4/5 
-2; The refurbished eye hospital, our room was a standard double costing £200 for a night. The room was dark and dismal with insufficient lighting, not helped by the dark paint (presumably to give atmosphere). The bathroom was originally white tiled, now off brown and needing re-grouting at least. Wooden toilet seat needed repairing. Not a great deal to say that's good about this hotel. We think it was clean - but how the maid cleaned in that light was a mystery. Significant amount of dust on the corridor door. Really disappointing for a Hotel Du Vin. Shame. 
-2; Hotel is not worthy of the Marriott name. It is like a motel, has staff that do not go the extra mile (which as someone who learnt their trade @ Marriott is instilled from Day One) and is not even that close to the airport. Rooms are accessed through the outside? really? At a Marriott full service hotel. Rooms are outdated and overall not impressive. BUT if you just need to stay somewhere before a flight I am sure it is OK, but I am sure there are also better hotels closeby?? 
-2; This is the fourth time I have stayed at this hotel but my first review. Arrived for a business meeting for a two night stay. The first room we were given had a horrible smell and absolutely no hot water!! We moved to a second room which was marginally better but this has no heating and the air conditioner had broken! The staff did the best they could and gave us a heater and to accommodate us free access to the executive lounge. The lounge has very executive offerings but we appreciated that the staff made an effort. We were told that the hotel was getting a facelift to the tune of 1.5 million but I think it may need more than this. I am going to try not to stay here again. Sorry Marriott 
-2; Very very tired Old place, like walking into 1950's Hospital. Dated room furniture, dated decor, in a desperate need of redecorating. Bed was very hard and uncomfortable. Breakfast was good on the plus side. However for £184 a night I expected a lot better. So bad that Having paid and booked for 2 nights, did not bother to stay the second night. Of course no refund was offered and nobody asked why. Wife hated the place. View and Breakfast are the only good things I can say about it. 
-2; We arrived at the hotel at 3pm on Thursday to find just one car parking space left, I feel sorry for those that arrived after. When you walk in, the reception area is beautifully presented and the the staff that checked us in were all very friendly. We took a little look around the restaurant and leisure facilities and they are great. Unfortunately the quality of the hotel appears to be on the ground floor only. After getting the lift to the second floor it felt like we had entered a different hotel. The carpet was straight out of the 80's and the walls were in serious need of a paint brush. We then came across the worst part of all, the room - It cost us £122 and it was crap. The room itself was tiny with damp stains across the ceiling and the bathroom was ridiculous - there is no way you could fit anyone larger than average in there and it didn't even have a bath!  This is by fast the worst hotel experience based on the money we spent. I certainly will not be recommending it to anyone. 
-2; To sum up really poor service declined greatly in past year , bus service now a scrum, BAR RESTAURANT AREA POOR POOR SEATING,tacky poor use space. one night stay at a push not really worth the effort now.Standards really slipping from 1year ago.When busy inadequate staff to cover front-line duties. 
-2;Booked a club room thinking it would be a higher standard. This was not the case. The bed was tiny, one dressing gown and one pair of slippers for two people, sealant round the bath looked like the work of a two year old. Self service breakfast did not fare much better. Bacon was like leather and the scrambled eggs were a congealed lump. No pot of tea on the table it was delivered and poured by a member of staff so one cup and that was it. Had to make our own toast. All this on what is supposed to be a club service. I will stay elsewhere if I return.
-2; This is the second time I have stayed here this year. First time had a nice room over looking the River Avon. The place was clean and staff seemed friendly even though there was a problem with the cold water, you had to run the cold tap in the bath for about 5 minutes to get it cold if you ran it in the sink only you would wait for ages. This time however I had a room in the old part over the bar, avoid 1-8 if there are any functions on as you can hear everything. The room was clean and had a nice charm with all the beams and squeaky floorboards no complaints so far.  Half way through a shower the hot water stopped when i reported it they said the pump had just gone and they had just called a plumber, Ok these things happen. Asked for a room in the new part-non available-no apologie. Over heard someone else reporting it and they said they had reported it that morning and still nothing had been done,umm. Had a comfortable night and after a trickle of hot water in the morning went to breakfast-be careful, you may have booked B&B but it is only a continental breakfast an extra £4.95 for a full english. The condition of the carpet in the dining room was quite digusting with threadbare bits, stains and crumbs all over it . I'm afraid to say that apart from the dining room staff all the other staff gave the impression that you were just a pain to be there. the hotel has a surperb location near the cathederal and only 5 minutes walk into town. This hotel is certainly not a 4* properly now only a bottom rate 3*. Shame because it could be a good hotel 
-2; I had travelled to Blackpool on business but was fortunate enough to have my family accompany me. I called ahead and asked if it was possible to have a travel cot and additional duvet in the room for my young daughter, I was assured this would be taken care of. Upon check in, I asked again and was told it was in my room. After a long drive up from London we were going to retire to our room and put our daughter down for a nap before heading out for dinner, once we got to the room there was no travel cot, i rang reception and they said it would be brought straight up. We waited for over an hour and nothing was brought to us, at which point our daughter had fallen asleep on the bed. We then went to a restaurant outside of the hotel and returned about 9pm, expecting the cot to be in place, it still was not, I once again rang and complained and was assured it would be brought straight up, it wasn't brought up until after 10pm. Not acceptable.  The hotel itself is reminiscent of what Blackpool would have been in its glory days, and this is quite possible where the Imperial Hotel should have remained, it seemed really dated, dusty and the room could have done with a good clean and coat of paint. The room door also didn't seem to offer much by the way of noise or light cover, the lights from the corridor lit up our room through the gaps, and you could hear every single noise from outside of our room, including a porter coming to collect trays from outside of the rooms at 12.30am, abruptly waking my daughter up.  The staff we encountered outside of 'cot-gate' were exceptionally friendly, especially at breakfast, which was for me the highlight of the trip. A good range of cold and hot options and the sausages were especially tasty.   We made the most of our stay but it is highly doubtful that we would choose to stay here when we return next. 
-2; Poor accommodation, bulbs missing from lights, no hooks or rails to hang or dry towels, paint or similar on bedroom carpets, strong smell of paint on the floor making sleeping difficult at best. Toilet in the room had clearly not been cleaned from the previous guest either! Restaurant food over cooked. Not impressed at all with this hotel. I have normally found this chain of hotels to be good value for the money and of a good standard, but not this time. I don’t think I’d stay here again. 
-2;" We stayed at the Imperial as part of a group, the hotel is tired and trading on past glories, quite obviously it was the destination hotel of its day and unfortunately its day was probably 30 or 40 years ago. Its four star rating seems generous. The staff are polite and encouragingly speak English but it is the detail that continually let this hotel down at every level over a long weekend.  Our room was tucked away on the fourth floor and probably not used very often [fair enough we were a very big group taking the whole hotel] but that does not excuse someone else’s hair and hairpin on the floor when we arrived, a kettle that was physically broken, a shower set on scalding, a broken room telephone and a room key that 50% of the time didn't work. The corridor doors bang. Incidentally a review below notes the electrical safety stickers on the lights with a comment from the manager that they would be removed &quot;straight away&quot; - still there in my room. The bed is good for a bad back, I didn't have one beofre my stay and I have now, and why do hotels provide three [poor quality] pillows for two guests in a double? Do management never stay in these rooms?  The fourth floor is accessed by its own lift that is clearly also used as the service lift, please please do not place laundry basket trolleys right outside the lift so you cannot get in or out of the lift. The used food / room service plate left next to lift on Saturday morning was still there at midnight.  On arrival we had arranged a package to be delivered and the front desk swore blind it wasn't there, turns out it had been delivered to the kitchen [!] but the kitchen hadn't sent it up to the desk, come on this is basic stuff.  On arrival no credit card imprint was taken so no drinks could be charged to the room, this wasn't just us but lots of people. We ordered room service [using a mobile via the hotel switchboard because the room phone was broken]. Burger and chips usually comes with mayo and tomato ketchup, not mustard, brown sauce and inexplicably tartare sauce - obviously no-one checked the tray before it left. There was then of course the problem of payment because no card had been pre authorised, the room service steward was a bit miffed that I wouldn’t let him walk away with my credit card to charge it at reception. Still not to worry because half an hour later the receptionist herself arrived [third visit after food delivery to get payment]. I'm booked into the hotel for a there night stay, they have my details and I'm being hassled, so I apologise if she got rather short shrift.  After authorising a credit card all was well until check out when it was cheerfully announced that everything had been charged to my card. No explanation of what had been charged to my card, no invoice, no check whether I wanted the card to be used [I prefer to pay cash on check out]. Poor  Finally we attended a gala dinner on the Saturday, as a veteran of probably 200 gala dinners this was amongst the worst. The tables were so close together the serving staff could not get through, there were a wholly inadequate number of serving staff, they were ill trained, each course arrived at tables haphazardly over a 5 to 10 minute period and plates were almost thrown on the table, one of my fellow diners narrowly avoided a gravy on the lap incident when the plate was half put on a napkin, fortunately the table cloth soaked it all up! The bread rolls had run out by the time they got to our table [I had to ask for them] - three rolls for ten diners? The whole meal took several hours to arrive, was badly served and was poor. A hotel of this quality should be able to deal with a 300+ person gala with ease. On my experience as a guest if you are interested in banqueting then avoid. The shining star was the drinks waitress working the front left hand corner who deserves much praise.  Breakfast is a redeeming feature although when I order tea I usually expect to get milk and not be told to go and get it myself from another table.  The cracks in service and the hotel [don't look up in the large function room or too hard on the outside] are very clear, it’s not a bad place to stay but they desperately need to get on top of the detail, building maintenance and customer service. "
-2; If you are looking for a good night's sleep after a long day seeing the sights do not stay at the Hoxton.  Wading through the whooping throng on arrival you may well ask if you are at the right place. On locating the reception desk, obscured at first by boozy bodies, the staff are friendly and efficient and you are reassured you have reached your destination.  Ascending to your first floor room you are greeted by a well appointed double room with all one could ask for. Then, as you flick your well worn shoes off and say goodnight, you become suddenly aware of it. Through the walls, the windows and the floorboards the sound of banging beats, 'hands in the air' epiphanies, obligatory whooping and the rude kiss goodnight to your good night's sleep.  On it goes until two in the morning and your unsuspecting guest has no choice but to go with it. The next day you inform the receptionist of the problem who seems remarkably obliging in suggesting a room swap to the second floor.  Problem solved, you look naively forward to another day's sights to see and a nice quiet room to greet you on your return. No such luck. On it goes again, until 3am this time on account of the clocks going back. You'll be needing that extra hour in bed as you try in vain to sleep through the assault. You call the manager who assures you it will be finishing very soon sir, he'll sort that out for you now sir.  The noise continues unabated, with perhaps a cursory tweak to the volume fader - by this point you have lost all grasp of sense and time - until finally, miraculously, you drop off.  In summary: The Hoxton Hotel is having its cake and eating it, as both a hotel and trendy night spot, coining it at the bar whilst charging a fair old whack to unsuspecting punters for a disturbed night's sleep.  No stranger to a late night myself, I was tempted to concede defeat and join the throng at one stage, pouring more money into the Hoxton's hungry coffers for drinks I didn't want. A win-win situation for them but a bum deal for me.  We received a refund for one night's stay. It was the least they could do. 
-2; Even if I got a good rate for this hotel, I would not stay again. Hotel is not to Hilton standard in either service or accomodation, also the bar is very expensive! Courtyard Marriott just up the road is far superior, cheaper and I will return there in future! Sorry Hilton but very disappointed this time! 
-2; We have come to Thurlestone every year for the last 7, and eaten at The Village Inn at least twice during each stay. We booked a table for an evening meal on Sat 7th Sept 2013 and I am sorry to say were disappointed. The menu has been dumbed down from the previous high quality and varied dishes. The main menu now resembles a Brewers Fayre type offering, with many components probably bought in frozen. We ordered rib eye steaks medium rare. One was cooked perfectly, the other was well done. The replacement that eventually arrived was cooked correctly, but was sirloin. The answer was that there had probably been some confusion?!My wife had nearly finished her meal by the time the replacement arrived. The staff turnover including Pub managers has been pretty well yearly since we have visited, but always high calibre, friendly and professional. The staff last night were not. There was no feeling of welcome or engagement, and that was before the steak had gone back! We were given some reperation when we asked, the bill was reduced by £1 as this was the difference between sirloin and rib eye! The beers and wines were good. 
-2; Room was fine, Wine/Beer extremely expensive and the restaurant food was absolutely the biggest rip off I have ever encountering in all my food consuming days. Waited an Hour and came Over cooked, and cold not sure how anyone can manager to take an hour to cook something and burn it but yet it turns up Cold? The waitress was very rude and just was not interested at all and head down and skulked off rather than improving an already disastrous experience. If you can avoid this restaurant - I sincerely recommend you do so. 
-2; We have stayed at this hotel two times. Our first time was superb and the second wasn't as good which was a great disappointment. I have contacted the hotel and have not had a reply to discuss my complaints. The cutterly and cups in the room was filthy and a unusual smell coming from the kettle, the plinth off the dressing table was broken, smudge marks over the windows. The wifi was not working which wasn't great because I had a lot of work to do over the Internet. But on the good side the location is pretty much amazing with the free parking. 
-2; The thing which really annoyed me about this hotel was specifying a double bed on the booking only to arrive and find I was in a twin single bedded room and then being faced with reception staff who, despite me waving my confirmation under their noses absolutely refused to put me in a double room unless I paid to upgrade, which I had to in the end. Bad start. Rooms look lovely and are lovely, but the air con is completely ineffective and I spent the night struggling for breath, let alone sleep. Overpriced and under acheiving 
-2; We booked for two nights but checked out after one. The stair carpets were badly worn on the edges which gave a bad impression. The room was tiny, bathroom so small I had to dry myself outside in the bedroom. There are venetian blinds on a glass screen separating the Loo from the bed. The curtains are a poor fit letting in too much light. The wardrobe did not exist, just a shallow cupboard near the door which was useless. The bed and room were very clean with good lighting. The breakfast tables were a joke, hardly room for one and the full breakfast was beans two eggs and bacon for which we paid extra. The coffee was good. The staff very friendly. Value for a single person for one night stopover in my opinion would be about £45.00 per night. A similar hotel in Antwerp, Belgium with extensive buffet breakfast costs 65 Euro for the room with airconditioning 
-2; This hotel represents all that's bad about UK hotels. Supposed to be 4* the room was 'upgraded' to a sea view which meant that in addition to the wafer thin walls and the sexual antics of the couple in the next room, we had to contend with the all night disco! It was necessary have the window open as there was no air conditioning but the open window enabled us to 'enjoy' the thumping sounds of the disco until 2 in the morning. As if that was not bad enough the bed left me with a shocking backache. I nearly broke my neck trying to manoeuvre around the tiny room. I just cannot believe this represents four star grade!!! On the plus side the food was excellent and the prices in the restaurant reasonable even if the restaurant itself had the ambience of a funeral parlour. The front desk staff were very nice. 
-2; Firstly let me say, i am not one of these people who just moan about everything and have posted mostly good reviews in the past. Having stayed at the Aviator during the airshow in 2012 and found it to be great with an added air of VIP'nes for the air show we had no hesitations in booking again for the 2016 weekend. To say it has gone down hill is a major understatement.  Firstly it isn't cheap for an airside room on airshow weekend. We wanted to arrive early on the saturday sit outside (on a chair) and enjoy the sun and watch the show as we had Sunday tickets. When paying that much money for an exclusive weekend you do not expect to the told you cannot sit outside during the day at its all booked for events but we could bring our own blanket and sit on the grass. lol.. i am sorry but are they joking, we are not school children.   When trying to pre-book the restaurant weeks before arrival we were told it was fully booked but could simply walk into the one eleven bar as no reservations can be made and eat whenever we want. However on the day we then got told that big parties had pre-booked many tables and they won't be able to guarantee us a table. Did they want us to go get ready for dinner then just sit around waiting in hope, its not the Harvester or Nados from christ-sake. To her credit the duty manager did sort us out a table when we complained.   Then there was the room, we paid extra for an airside room which was on the 1st floor, the views were completely obscured by buildings and busses on the airfield perimeter so we may have well have not bothered. One positive (so we thought) was the room AC, we went to bed lovely and cool on a very hot evening but the hotel in their infinate wisdom seem to automatically turn off the AC in the early hours, so we wake up drenched in sweat.. nice!   The place was completely understaffed the whole weekend, the tables were left full of empty bottles, broken glass on the floor, mess everywhere way into the late hours. i had to abandon the bar as i stood there waiting for 15 mins and got completely ignored by the bar staff the whole time, there wasn't even anyone in front of me they just stood there making drinks for people on the tables, not even a please wait.  Anyway, a bad experience through and through and will not be going back ever.. Shame as it kind of killed the fond memories i had of the place. 
-2;" We were a party of three for Sunday Lunch. The staff are attentive; however, I feel that there is not enough organisation. The table was booked for 1:00; however, it was about twenty past before we sat at our table, and then only after one of our party prompted the staff. The dining room is very nice; but the food is less than average. The menu is unimaginative; one of our party is vegetarian and found the main-course (mushroom risotto) virtually uneatable. Overall I would award the venue 7 out of 10 for ambiance, and the food 3 out of 10 (and for the vegetarian option 2 out of 10). As far as pricing is concerned the venue is reasonable; however, after that is said we have had better meals for less. With good kitchen staff and an imaginative chef this could be a really nice venue. As it stands we will not be going back any time soon, which is a real pity because the place does have a nice atmosphere. "
-2; My wife booked the stay for a celebration of my 40th birthday via an email offer she had received. And if I'm honest I wish she hadn't!   Now I don't want to seem ungrateful or appear a snob, because I'm neither, under normal circumstances... However, when my wife and guest enquired about some beauty treatment or another they were dismissed rudely by the spa staff who appeared as welcome as a clown at a funeral.  Disappointed they left and decided upon some retail therapy instead.  Myself and guests were due to golf for a few hours whilst the ladies did what they did, but because of meetings we were unable to select a suitable tee time and decided to select another course which could accommodate us better, and boy were we glad we did. We found a great little course not far from Matfen with some fantastic customer service and for a fraction of the money matfen were charging! (I'll review that when I get a moment).  So, golf and shopping complete we returned to matfen to freshen up before dinner.   Well the showers were dreadful with more pressure available from an old tin watering can I have in the garden...  The dinner in the keepers lodge was nice, however the heating was unbearable and ruined what could have been a nice meal, even having the doors propped open offered no help.  Returning to the room was even worse, the heating was unbearable and we had a restless night with the windows wide and full of insects.  As we checked out we decided to raise our issues with the duty manager who took us away into a secluded room to hear our concerns, obviously away from any other guests earshot to avoid them hearing. We were assured that our issues would be investigated and we would be contacted (although I'm unsure how as our details were not taken down and we have heard nothing back) still, with this in mind I am certain that this is one so called country house hotel that we will not be visiting again.  Poor show Matfen, very disappointing. 
-2; We were due to stay at the Radisson, Liverpool on Sunday 27th August during the mathew street festival. I booked at the hotel direct and paid cash, I was advised check in was at 14:00 but upon arrival at 13:50 this had suddenly changed to 15:00 hours. If this is the correct check in time then A) why was I told 14:00 hours? and B) who would want to check in so late.   We were then allocated a disabled room without a bath. We advised the lady we did not want this room as we would like a bath, I also enquired as to why the window in the room didn't open and could we have a room with a window that opened as I smoke but my girlfriend doesn't, we were told none of the windows in any rooms opened at all. I advised we stayed a couple of years ago and had a window that opened but the lady disputed this which is rather silly considering I offered to point which room we stayed in out to her. I have never stayed in a hotel with windows that do not open.   The rooms although quite nice are not upto the standard they were 2 years ago and in my opinion are not worth the £120-140 per night charge when you consider what you can get elsewhere for that money. The staff are polite and helpfull. the mini-bar is extortionate as is the nibbles menu. If you are looking to stay in the best hotel in Liverpool then unfortunately the Radisson is not the one any more. I would choose the Ibis for value or the Hope Street hotel for quality.  
-2;"The hotel is in an excellent location. It is rather basic but clean and comfortable. The room I booked was advertised as having a &quot;free mini-bar&quot; which consisted of a 500ml bottle of water inside an otherwise empty mini-fridge. I asked about this and the receptionist told me that I also had free tea and coffee making facilities! The most annoying thing though was the stealth early arrival charge. I checked in online and one of the questions was regarding the arrival time. I selected &quot;before noon&quot; because this was when my flight arrived. When I arrived at the hotel I was greeted with a £20 supplementary charge for early check in. There was no mention of this online during the check-in process and I have never encountered it before. The receptionist explained that I needed to pay more because I was essentially hiring out the room for more hours. But of course there would have been no refund on my rate had I arrived in the late evening. The room was free and empty so there was no need to charge this extra money.  TLDR: Clean and basic but be careful of extra charges!"
-2;" The exterior is very drab & unappealing; something alike a concrete block of flats but the interior is of a very high standard & cleanliness was no concern. The hotel itself is huge & clearly set up with a primary intent to cater for large conferences & parties. This was the purpose of my stay, and I found it just catered for this sufficiently, but I would definitely not recommend this hotel for any other purpose. Rooms were furnished reasonably well but were small & I was particularly surprised to find no door between the toilet and the rest of the room. Sound insulation between the rooms was poor & the noise of showering was very plainly heard from surrounding rooms. Evening bar food was disappointing, unimaginative & did not reflect the price nor the hotel image. Breakfast was good but let down by poor management; there was a huge queue with around twenty minutes waiting time. The bar was well staffed on the first evening, but there were very clear management issues & a flurry of confusion. The service on the second evening was absolutely dreadful; there were far too few staff; some who were clearly new, inexperienced & entirely without sufficient supervision. I waited twenty minutes for a drink, then later FIFTY minutes for the next. I will not be going back. "
-2; I called in to check this place out as a venue for a future meeting. Really liked the whole place, clean, and seemingly well run. Sadly one staff member doesn't understand that customers are there to be sold things. I arrived in the restaurant at 10.02 am and asked if I could have breakfast. 'no, it's after ten o'clock' By two minutes? With guests in the restaurant still waiting their breakfast? Was I offered a coffee? NO, just NO, we've finished. Now call me old fashioned but here's a hotel with a vast amount of money spent on it and the staff don't understand what pays their wages!  Get a grip someone please 
-2; Stayed in this hotel in January and being a hhonors member I have stayed in Hiltons around the world, so expected the same high levels of customer service. How wrong I was, some of the Hilton Deansgate staff have an attitude that you can complain all you like but who cares you will leave soon and the problem will go away. I had some serious concerns with cleaning procedures with corrosive cleaning substances being left next to my contact lenses and toothbrush, and with a tv remote taking 20 hours to be put in my room so I could actually watch tv. That's not forgetting the mix up when I checked in for 2 nights but you checked me in for just 1.I wrote these issues in a letter to the manager but 6 weeks later still no response so I presume this complaint was filed with all the other complaints in the bin. 
-2; Not up to standard I'm afraid, lobby looks the part but room was a bit grubby and there was loads of noise all through the nite. I've paid a lot less for other hotels and had a lot better experience. I wouldn't stop here again, not impressed. 
-2; On the outskirts of Cheltenham, your first impressions of this hotel are disappointing - it looks like a three star hotel (maybe less) and it never lives up to it's four star rating. We booked a twin room, and were allocated a double. The receptionist said we'd never made the request for a twin, and then found the request! We asked for a quiet room and were given a noisy one at the front of the hotel overlooking the busy main road. No lift and on the second floor - so if you struggle with stairs make sure you request a ground floor room. The room was basic - small flat screen TV, single glazed so very noisy, bathroom was tired, heated towel rail didn't work (in spite of warning to the contrary!), shower was powerful but heater control u/s so you could have hot or scalding, and bathroom lights were full of dead flies!!!!! The gym which is separate from the hotel but connected by a tunnel is a full fitness and spa facility and well equipped. Receptionist was cold and disinterested. Bar staff good. Wifi was free but reception weak. Overall a huge disappointment all round 
-2; We stayed at the angel inn for one night in the brickelhamton room, the room is very small with a very dated bathroom,it had a large crack across the sink and a also a dirty toilet which needed a deep clean , the cobweb on the ceiling in the room was not too pleasant either above the door, overall it was not the best room to stay after a lovely wedding, particularly as it wasn't inexpensive either.we expected more for £90 for a Saturday evening. The next morning we enjoyed our breakfast and the staff seemed very friendly , Overall could do much better. 
-2; Christmas stay. Good room - and reasonable breakfast - but over priced for Margate. Staff generally indifferent. Not particularly welcoming.But biggest joke was a £30 charge for a 1pm checkout. Boutique hotel it is not. Won't be returning. 
-2; The room was poor, the TV did not work! and the basin's plug was sealed in closed position! so after using it I could not drain the water. Both issues reported when I arrived, neither fixed! The expensive Wifi available in the room was extremely weak and did not reach all the parts of the room. Notably, it was at it's weakest around the location of the small desk area in the room! 
-2; We recently visited the bar area at The Bull and were surprised that a corner of this area appeared to have been turned into a crèche, with young children in school uniform running around with no shoes on, screeching and shouting. There were children lying in the floor and school bags surrounding the table at which their mother (?) was sitting. The impression given was a little like an airport lounge.  This didn’t give a very favourable impression and we were surprised that when we spoke with the bar staff, that this was considered acceptable based on the fact thay they were long-term guests, staying at the hotel during a house renovation.  We understand that the hotel would want to cater for all but this inconsiderate group did not give a good impression when you are also booking business meetings.  I tried to contact the hotel but they have decided to ignore me. Looks like we'll try The Bellhouse down the road next time. 
-2; I stayed at this hotel as the pictures looked lovely despite some comments which I read. I was aware of the hotel being more expensive then others but this was not a issue as you got to pay the price for luxury..Paying the price I did and then to find the issues with just checking me in to my room had annoyed me! DELAYS and a huge que!! Whilst in the room everything looked lovely and smelt fresh UNTIL I noticed a stain by the sofa bed, I then pushed the sofa bed out and was amazed at the level of dust and the Hair clips I found. I don't complain normally and I did not want to waste my time in calling reception to let them know my findings. However on checkout I did advise the receptionist who didnt seem to have much interest.   Breakfast in the morning was not brilliant and everyone just looked busy, I could have cooked a breakfast better!!   I have stayed at many other Doubletree hotels and my experiences have been brilliant.  Overall to sum up I wont be coming back here and do advise this hotel management team to make some changes to its operations!! 
-2; I guess expectation was high based upon reviews and the price charged. It was Christmas Day dinner. Upon arrival at 3pm we were invited to go to the bar or the drawing room but there were no seats available and it took a full 45mins to even get a drink. After finally taking up vacant seats we were informed that dining tables were being prepared and canapés were then served upon the hour. At 4:30 we were finally invited through to our table. The receptionist confirmed on our way in that the restaurant would pay for a bottle of wine with our dinner owing to the extensive delays. I had to ask for a wine list and after only a few minutes the waiter came to ask what we would like to order. The food itself was of high quality and the waiters very friendly. No complaints there. However, because we were so hungry because of the delay, we'd snacked on the bread obviously put on the table to buy them time, my sister in law was unable to finish her main meal. This also affected our desire to complete the dining experience. At the end of the meal we declined Christmas cake and coffees to be greeted by the bill which did not include the reduction of a bottle of wine we'd ordered.  I think it unlikely I return there. Be warned - if you're expecting to eat at a given time on an occasion such as Christmas then do not count on their timekeeping. Very, very poor. 
-2; Great location in the middle of historic Cirencester. Hotel and its rooms finished to a high standard. Rooms are large, well furnished and with great character.  First night (Friday) we got very little sleep - top floor, front facing room (307) has neither double nor secondary glazing. Noise from the hotel's popular bar drifted up initially, only to be replaced by street racing teenagers playing music in the early hours.   The curtains then fell away from the window, as not properly fixed (used thick sticky tape, which could not hold weight of curtains once tie backs undone) allowing in the street light and then the early summer sun. To top it off, the market immediately outside starting building their metal stalls early on... shattered!!  Disapointed with front desk response in morning - I made it clear we had barely slept and reasons why - rather neutral and lacking empathy. Moved on request to a quieter room (219), no response as to whether the police were called re the street racing or management aware, no comment on curtains being not fit for purpose, other than 'I'll let maintainence know', no real apology.  Next room (219) was quiet and were able to sleep. Could hear next door chatting but stopped by midnight.  Following day same front desk man asked how the new room was, adding was one of his favourites (is a nice room) but no enquiry as to whether we had been able to sleep and still no apology.   On exiting the hotel, we could still see curtains half hanging off in the window of 307... hopefully room was not being used that night!  Breakfast nice, weighting staff nice, food service a little low.  Could have been great if windows double or secondary glazed and service raised a couple of levels. 
-2; We picked up a brochure which describes a different place to the Palace Hotel we stayed at. We were visiting friends for a few days and wanted to make it a luxury break. When booking there was not much available on the Internet site. We travel abroad quite a lot and this is the most convenient way of booking.  I would seriously ask the question if the rooms on Internet sites are inferior to booking directly, because the room we had was dreadful and not the four star standard you would expect even if it was the worst room in the place it is enough to reduce this place to less than one star. My wife and I could not move around the room, which had a bed, a wardrobe, a chair and a make up dresser with stool. All these items of furniture look as though they were purchased in a house clearance.  The bed head is a fixed panel in brushed draylon and a wooden radio from the 1940's set in the centre and an old box TV, plonked on a small table in the window bay, which is similar to the one I threw away fifteen to twenty years ago.  What else do you get in this four star accommodation, climate control in the form of an open window when it's too hot or blanket when it's too cold and if it's very cold an old free standing electric heater is provided in the corner.  The Ensuite was disgusting with broken tiles around the small bath which doubled as a shower, also the water pressure is none existent and the hot water was tepid and not just a one off, that was constantly the case through out our stay. There is a toilet located next to the basin and bath, all of which is crammed in to a cupboard space. There is a small wooden shelf above the basin to put your toothbrush on and no where to put your toiletries, except the floor.  The general condition of the room took me back to when I used to visit my grandma in the eighties, but her decor was new!!!  Every where through out the Palace Hotel is tired and where necessary been tarted up in the public areas. You enter the foyer which gives the impression of grandeur and opulence, but everything is down hill from that point. After check in and a long drive, we wanted to relax with a drink and headed for the bar, which was closed at 10 pm. The two night porters were doubling up on duties, doing absolutely nothing and begrudgingly opened the bar area, after nearly a stand up argument. We were immediately joined by three other couples who didn't want a confrontation with the job's worth on the reception. To get another drink we individually had to run round to the reception for these two natter jacks to do a little work. Unfortunately it was too late to go else where, other wise we would have taken the other people with us.  After that experience we couldn't be bothered with complaining about the room accommodation and toyed with the idea of checking in else where !!!  We soldiered on hoping things would improve. NO IT DID NOT, those people we met during the course of our stay, who didn't have a complaint, not many and said, we've been coming years, seemed to be easily impressed with the history of the place and view it through rose tinted glasses.  The food and service is ok, but not exceptional as the brochure would lead you to believe, but make no mistake you are paying for first class fayre!!   I accept the exterior and gardens are very impressive, but one day we decided to play on the nine hole golf course with friends. The course lacked maintenance, in particular the greens which needed a lawn mower. It was like putting on a shag pile carpet. We met the attendant in the golf shop who told us at 3pm that day we were the first people he'd seen all day. He would be better employed on a lawn mower and roller, not difficult is it !!  I could go on and on, we were given the excuse, as we're others, the hotel is going to be refurbed.   When? is the question. An impressive past and the place to be in the 1960's and a refurb in the future, but it is here and now that matters and today I feel deceived and all our expectations have been dashed and we were thoroughly disappointed. So much so we booked into the Grand Hotel in Torquay for an extended day. Ten times better.   The Palace charges top dollar and I would only be satisfied if I got my money back. The Palace? Thanks but no thanks!!!! 
-2; There was a charge on my invoice that I don't recognise as I never ordered anything, I'm upset about this!! The staff have poor people skills and are insensitive towards to way people feel. The quality of the English Breakfast was below average. Dinner prices were quite dear too. 
-2; We were quickly shown to our table in the dining area and our drinks order was taken. the initial service was good and our starters arrived. The waitress advised us that she would get our bread (the menu states that a selection of bread is served with all three course meals, which is what we were having. For all further orders etc we had to call a waitress over. The starter was dissapointing and we had to call another waitress over to fetch our bread. This turned into two armoured rolls which we later returned. (an adjoining tables occupants had tried unsuccessfully to break open their rolls and left them). The chap in charge never turned a hair when we complaind and appeared uninterested. Generally: 3rd class meal, 2nd class service but 1st class prices! Never again!!! 
-2; I'd give it 2.5 if I could.  We've been to the Swan a good few times having got married just down the road at Bibury Court.  On the plus side...the Swan is a lovely place and one of my favourites to go and drink in. The gardens are stunning at anytime of the year. The bar area is the perfect setting to while away a few hours nursing a pint or two - or in the small courtyard in the summer. It really is a fantastic place to go for a drink. The staff are generally polite and friendly.  We've eaten here and to be honest it's often disappointing. The Sunday lunch is average (the trout starter is good) but main courses can be off the mark. Food can take a very long time to arrive (our first visit was reminiscent of a certain hotel-based John Cleese sitcom!). Burgers off the bar menu were appalling. Other dishes had components missing that were advertised on the menu. The food is not cheap either and often below average for the price you pay. It's not uncommon to hear other diners grumble amongst themselves.   Our last visit we had a plate of sarnies and a bowl of chips that were absolutely fine. I'm playing it safe from now on.         
-2; Just spent a weekend at this hotel and now consider it to be very poor value for money. The hotel was very noisyat night thus a good nights sleep was not possible..dispite a room change! and to top it all breakfast was served cold !!! 
-2;stayed at low wood bay 24th Jan had booked it as Xmas present for my wife,when booking it asked for any requests,I asked if poss room with lake view only to be told on the day we got there no room with lake view available I booked in early December and was not contacted telling me this because I would not have booked.In the resuraunt our meal was poor for the money we paid I had the chop which was all bone l told the waiter but I don't think his English was great he kept coming out with the food and going to the wrong table.In the morning we went down for breakfast to be told to wait in the bar area and someone would come and get us,no tables were available we waited 20mins, there were quite a few people waiting lots of unhappy faces during breakfast my wife got hers first and sat down i was 2 places behind her i had to wait over 10 minutes for bacon saus & fried egg to be replaced by which time she had finished.Our plan after breakfast was to use the pool but because of the delay we ran out of time,at checkout I paid the bill and went to the car but when I checked the bill they had overcharged me for the evening meal by nearly £20 this was meant to be nice treat for my wife with our 3 kids she doesn't get much time to relax and the price I paid i can't afford to do it all the time.I think the Staff are over stretched the hotel tries to do too much and they can't handle it i will not go back there.    
-2; Stayed here with my partner in August 2013. Nice position next to beach and it is obvious that this was quite a plush hotel in its day. Not any more though i am afraid. The room we had was not exactly dirty but a bit tired around the edges - the bathroom however, was dirty. The bedroom had strange doors which looked like they had been adapted from panels of chipboard and rattled all through the night (we had to have the windows open becuase it was so hot in the room). Staff all seemed OK and the bar was quite relaxing. Can't comment on the restaurant as we ate out for both evening meal and breakfast. At £99 a night I can't honestly recommend this hotel as it needs a major overhaul. Hythe was nice but I would definitely choose somewhere else to stay next time I visit. 
-2; I stayed here in business recently for one night. It felt like going back in time to the bad hotels of the past.  I suppose someone has to get the rubbish room and I certainly felt that was my case. The hotel lobby is promising and grand. However, once you get into the room corridors things go down hill. My room was located in some annex above the vents from the kitchen. Room was small, cold and dingy. Bedding smelt stale and the bathroom had a cracked tile which you could pick up if you so wanted. Shower was either lava hot or freezing. No safe, no free wifi (unless you are a BT Openzone customer) and a charge for using your credit card to pay. I have stayed in hotels of all star ratings across the UK and Europe and never had to pay to use my credit card. Come on seriously.  Hotel breakfast was OK but service was very poor. Boiled eggs caused great confusion. Hotel gets one extra star as the eggs were nice when they finally arrived. My colleagues stayed in the Abode for the same price and I would recommend going there. 
-2; There is no guaranteed car parking and if you do manage to get some it does not match with the website prices! Beware the alarming computer half way through the night, Despite asking for this to be addressed it was not Breakfast is OK but a bit of a bun fight after a long queue. The bar closes at 0030 The general feel was not good Iam afraid 
-2;" My wife and I booked a 1 night stay at the Hotel du Vin in Winchester in order to celebrate her birthday. Everything (room booking and dinner reservation) was booked online and whilst we received confirmation of the room booking, our dinner reservation was not mentioned. Thinking it might be a good idea to confirm the dinner reservation, I telephoned the hotel at about 1130 on the Friday morning. I had no success getting anyone to answer the telephone in the bistro or when I selected the &quot;existing booking&quot; option. I tried several times without success and once I was simply cut off. Eventually, I got through to the front desk and confirmed everything. Not a good start.   We had booked a &quot;Superior Double&quot; on the Dinner, Bed & Breakfast deal at a cost of over £200 for 1 night. We were shown to our room and it was, I have to admit, a lovely-looking room. Relaxing in the room before heading out for a drink when my wife noticed a stain on the duvet (white duvet with a white duvet cover - the stain showed through very clearly). Dark in colour, it was probably red wine, but could quite easily have been blood. A closer look at the duvet revealed a number of what looked like small pieces of paper inside the duvet cover. We pulled back the cover and reached in to retrieve the nearest piece of 'paper' - it soon became clear what had been done. The duvet was covered in stains and someone had come up with the brilliant idea and getting some white adhesive labels (address labels?) and sticking them over the stains!! Needless to say we phoned reception and asked that the duvet be changed whilst we were out (which it was, but with the duvet cover on inside out!)   We headed into dinner and were promptly handed our menus and the wine list – everything looked fantastic. When we were brought some water, I happened to mention to the waiter that we were on the DB&B deal. He hastily brought us the Plats du Jour menu and another waiter had to explain that we could still order from the A la carte menu, but that there would only be a £20 ’allocation’ towards the cost of the food. There are no examples of the Plats du Jour menu on the website (I realise they change regularly…), but I am certain that if there was, the take-up on the DB&B deal would fall away dramatically – the gulf between the two menus is huge and, given the choice, one would opt for the A la carte menu every single time. Interestingly, we stayed at Hotel TerraVina (in the New Forest) just before Christmas and their Dinner Bed & Breakfast offer enabled us to choose absolutely anything from the Al la carte menu, which, quite frankly, is what you expect. Given that we knew that the night was going to cost about £250 (with wine), we stuck with the Plats du Jour menu; the food was completely unremarkable. On the upside, the bistro had a good atmosphere and looked ‘just right’.   We went back to our room after dinner and my wife wanted to wash her make-up off before bed. She ran the hot tap, but when the water was still running cold 5 minutes later, she boiled the kettle and filled the basin instead. The following morning the same thing happened with the shower – I left the bathroom and went to watch the news whilst I was waiting for the water to warm up!   The tipping point probably came at breakfast the next morning when we were told that our booking only entitled us to a continental breakfast and did not cover the option of a cooked breakfast. I honestly didn’t believe what I was being told, so I went out to reception and asked the receptionist – she confirmed that the information was correct. The Hotel du Vin in Winchester, surely one of the most expensive hotels in town, does not offer its guests a cooked breakfast when they book a room on a Dinner, Bed & Breakfast basis? Really?   My wife, who had made the booking herself, was, understandably, highly upset by this point. Not long after we checked out and, thoroughly deflated, headed home. Our trip to Winchester, which was meant to be a celebration, will be remembered for stained duvets, disappointing food, a lack of hot water and the relentless pressure on guests to spend more – they want paying guests to book the Dinner Bed & Breakfast deal, before then ordering from the A la carte menu at dinner and paying extra for a cooked breakfast. I last stayed at the Hotel du Vin in Winchester many years ago and it’s disappointing to see how much standards have slipped since then. From start to finish, a hugely dispiriting (and occasionally unhygienic) experience... "
-2; Absolutely stunning setting but hotel was poor. Rooms dirty and the carpets in most areas are a trip hazard. Not Hilton standard in fact nowhere near. Even left a night early that's how disappointed we were. 
-2; I've stayed here before, it's Ok for a big chain hotel but tonight the hotel has fallen to a new low. This hotel has at least 8 floors, I'm on the 7th. The elevators don't work, apparently the've been broken since at least yesterday according to other guests. I enquired as to when the elevators might be fixed, the front desk had no idea. SO if you are coming here then look forward to plenty of exercise on the stairs. There is a staff lift through a maze of 'private' corridors which should enable you to get that heavy luggage up and down. However it's very small and well... not what you'd expect for a guest. The room is very small, you can just about touch all four walls from the bed.  The air-con does work and my room faces inwards so is relatively quiet. Jogging down all those stairs to go get some food from the gas station which the hotel sits on top of is pretty tiresome. Which reminds me, suggest you don't open the windows of the rooms on the front of the hotel, unless of course you like the smell of diesel and petrol.  There is no fridge in the room so don't expect to keep any of that food you just bought from the gas station, no way to keep the water bottle cool either.  Bed is very comfortable although the pillows are the usual hypoallergenic lumps of petrochemical based creation. I'd say foam but it may be something else.  Decor in the room is modern if a little chipped around the edges. Wifi is free an fast.  For the price of this place I'd say you can do much better. Suggest the Grange chain of hotels 
-2;The hotel is very old with bits of character however that is no excuse for the shabby conditions experienced. On the plus side the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the stay and this is the main reason it gets a poor rating rather than terrible.   Room - Large room with separate area with 2 bunk beds. Decent size bathroom which was clean and tidy however the lighting in the bathroom was very very poor. The radiator was on full blast and despite shutting it off at the screw cap it would not switch off. The bedside light shades were the oldest fittings you have ever seen and one was missing a bulb. The bed wasn't the most comfortable hard and the pillows were hard enough to cut diamonds on. Ordered room service which arrived after 50 minutes and one reminder phone call minus the drinks order! The TV was flatscreen, located on the wall and had most freeview channels.  The floorboards in the corridoors outside the room were very creaky and the noise resonated throughout the room whenever anyone walked past.   Spa - Again, unloved! The changing rooms were shabby at best with the broken lockers, old showers with missing doors / curtains, wonky celing tiles and completely random locker numbering system. Gents had to obtain a padlock from the spa reception (not used this system of locker for about twenty years). Used the pool twice as it was a fair size for swimming lengths yet this was a little chilly at first. The jacuzzi was warm enough but half of the surrounding plastic grill was missing. Let's hope no one puts their foot through the holes, falls and sues as there may be a little less cash for refurbishment! Oh and the clock had stopped (minor thing but indicitive of the levels of attention to detail, or lack of). Did not use the gym but looked a good size and well equipped.   Food - Room service meal was ok when it eventually arrived. Went into the breakfast room for a for a look around. Had been speaking to a couple earlier who stated that their request for tea/coffee was ignored until almost after they had finished and the choice was not great (no beans or hash browns), the fruit selection looked decidedly old and dry and that it seemed 'organised chaos' Having confirmed this for myself after a couple of minutes I decided to skip breakfast.   I can see that the General Manager has offered to accommodate guests again when they have submitted poor reviews. Total shortsightedness - If you have had a bad visit why on earth would you want to come back for more of the same! Please don't ask me back!   Did note that upon checkout the member of staff chose not to ask 'how was the stay?' and I to be honest I really don't blame her.
-2;" You will sadly be shocked and disappointed by the accommodation. Fact is clear; this is the perfect location for an overnight prior to flight out of T4, 100%, no brainer. BUT.... The rooms are like a time-warp disaster from the early nineties, tired and tatty at that. And we took a room on the so-called ‘Executive Floor’!! Do not [not] be fooled by their photography, the rooms are small + cramped. The restaurant food is very average [soup was the only exception] and not worth the price tag, however you do become a bit of a ‘captive audience’ in the eating stakes when you find yourself over-nighting at an airport! Then there is the ‘on site’ inclusive parking....in reality it is in fact a scruffy little open-air car park which is over the road and down a staircase, so you really need to be savvy on arrival and departure, make sure that you drop your party at the hotel entrance WITH all luggage prior to going ‘round the block [back onto main roads] and then back in to the car park slip road, DO NOT make the mistake of going into the car park with a boot full of luggage to struggle up the small spiral staircase with!  In summary? A perfect location for an overnight prior to flight out of T4.....but don’t expect to be comfortable or impressed with the room and restaurant. "
-2; I stayed at the hotel in June 2009. Check in was quick and efficient. Unfortunately the room was on the small side and very hot. Even though it was a sunny day it felt as though there was a lot of heat coming from somewhere in the building. The bed was very comfortable. However the room felt a bit dated and in need of modernising especially the cramped bathroom. My room was not in the main part of the hotel but in a separate building. The hotel staff were efficient and friendly. I only had breakfast in the restaurant which was good especially the cooked breakfast which was hot, unlike some hotels were it is lukewarm. The hotel is at the top of the hill from the pier and set back from the sea front. This means a 10 to 15 minute walk to the pier but has the advantage of being located in a quiet street. 
-2; I never usually write reviews on Tripadvisor but felt very disappointed with my stay at the Blakeney and wanted to help make sure that no one else leaves with the same sense of being ripped off. The room was nice, a bit small and with some poor fittings (such as a light weight door which looked like it came from a cheap office and didn’t do much to keep out noise from the corridor) along with some nicer pieces. The view of the estuary was lovely although some may think it a bit bleak. The recently refurbished reception and sitting room were also nice and gave high expectations on arrival. However, the bar and dining room are very old fashioned, not in a nice way, just tired and a bit dirty.  What irked was the ludicrous prices and general meanness about the place. I travel a lot and stay in some very nice and expensive hotels and have no qualms about high cost rooms when everything is top quality and I believe that they are reasonable value for money. Paying just under £300 per night for a small , mediocre room (grade A on the hotel’s scale) in Norfolk was far too much for what was provided. Despite the overpriced room they still tried to squeeze extra out of their customers at every opportunity, such as £2.50 per guest for cheap disposable slippers which were not provided as standard in the room, or a similar charge for bringing an expensive bottle of champagne (on which they were already making a hefty mark-up) to our friend’s room in the middle of the afternoon.   The food was disappointing. Poorly prepared and low quality ingredients, certainly not showing off some of the lovely produce available in Norfolk.   One further and more minor complaint is they do not have any kind of online booking facility and although you can receive information about rates online and they will confirm availability and rates via email they insisted that they do not take reservations by email, it should be done over the phone. Moreover, they send confirmations by post rather than email. The hotel may be aiming at an old fashioned charm but this is just annoying.   The staff were mixed, some charming (especialy the night porter and trainee receptionist), some a bit strange and managers not very friendly.  The hotel was very busy, mainly with older couples (my wife and I are early thirties) and a few families, so it clearly holds an appeal for some, backed up by some of the good reviews on this website. However, I for one felt robbed by the experience and it certainly did not live up to the expectations created by the location and high prices. I certainly won’t be returning and if I was in the area again would go to one of the lovely B&Bs available at half the price. 
-2;" Stayed here on a Saturday night and while the staff were friendly and accommodating, the hotel has a tired, out of date feel. The room had seemingly paper thin walls, meaning you could hear a lot of background noise from the corridor and surrounding rooms, including toilets flushing and lights switches being used. Not great for a good night's sleep. Unfortunately breakfast wasn't much better - not enough staff on duty meant they were overwhelmed; we had to clear our own table, struggled to find clean glasses for fruit juice, and gave up waiting for coffee! "
-2; No garden, no Inn! A very functional and absolutely soulless hotel but with decent facilities - proper tea and coffee and glasses rather than plastic beakers. The shower room even had flannels. It is a hotel built for the car with views one side of the cars whizzing around the inner ring road, and on the other side of a massive car park - despite only being a short walk from Temple Meads station. Room was fine, if you like views of dual carriageways and traffic lights. Not exactly the best of Bristol as European Green Capital of 2015! 
-2; This is a very grand hotel, in a lovely setting, with beautiful common rooms and lots of original features from its' previous life. The beer from the bar was good, the garden terrace very nice and the breakfast was also perfectly acceptable.  But a hotel is about its' bedrooms, and for £125 a night, I expect a good nights sleep. The room was a good size - with double aspect windows and a nice bathroom. All of the features of a four star were there - ironing board, trouser press, toiletries.   The problem was the heat, it was like an oven, the air conditioning unit apparently doesn't work - and the problem with opening the windows, which I had to do, was that one was over the delivery entrance downstairs and that was noisy from the morning, and the other was onto a flat roof that meant anyone could easily climb into the room. The other feature of the flat roof was the extractor fan for the air conditioning for the rooms below - which was very very noisy. So, too hot, no option of quiet fresh air, so I settled for noise, and what a noise. This was enhanced by the sheer volume of the extractor fans from the bathrooms above and around me, which came on every time anyone went to the loo and were on for a minute or so, louder than hell, all night.  Throw in blankets rather than quilt, and two pathetic excuses for pillows, and I was really not pleased by the time my alarm told me it was time to get up.   My colleague complained and got 50% off his bill, because he works in Weybridge and will need to book a room again. I didn't have the energy - I will simply use a different hotel if I ever have to go back.  Very disappointing. 
-2; Pleasant suroundings and good accomodation, but the restaurant food is well below 4* standard and over priced. The staff in the restaurant are poorly trained and unable to provide even drinks in an acceptable format.  Overall not worth the money!! 
-2; Despite being local to London, it is always nice to look forward to stay in 'town.' Set in a beautiful part of London (Kensington), all was set for a great night at the Royal Albert Hall, and a night away from the kids.  We were hugely disappointed to be put in a tiny room, where there really wasn't room to swing the proverbial cat, let alone get around each other as we were getting dressed.  Our room was located directly opposite another bedroom, which coupled with the tight corridor, made for noise neighbours whenever they left or came to their room.  Breakfast was an extortionate £20 a person - save your money and head to Paul Boulangerie near Gloucester Road Underground.  Having stayed at The Grange St Paul's, we were looking forward to this stay. We now wish we had chosen one of the other many hotels in the neighbourhood. 
-2; Visited for 1 night whilst on staycation. The room and bathroom were OK but could do with modernising and the beds could be much more comfortable.   The gym and pool were also OK but again could do with updating. Didn't really feel like I was in a four star hotel.   Breakfast was worst part of the stay. The buffet had fresh pastries, cereals and fruits which were perfectly fine but the cooked breakfast was atrocious. We were almost sick after eating a bit of the sausage and the scrambled egg was rubbery and dry. So very disappointed. They need to cook fresh food and at least taste what they are serving. 
-2;" From outside, this hotel looks 4 star. Once Inside it doesn't. We weren't looking for spa treatment, just clean, convenient and comfortable accommodation. The basic room was uninspired but OK. Unfortunately it wasn't particularly clean: there were hairs in the shower cubicle and floor didn't look to have been cleaned; nor was the room serviced properly overnight (our drinks glasses were neither emptied nor removed). Breakfast was OK, but the service was poor; coffee wasn't forthcoming without effort and my chair was covered with the prior incumbent's crumbs.  It could I suppose, happen to anybody, but the final trials were: 1) a faulty telephone service which meant that our repeated attempts to warn of a late arrival were simply unanswered and 2) a boiler failure which meant no heating and no hot water for our second and final day, We received an unprompted refund of ~31% on our ~£115 overnight charge. "
-2;"I have now stayed in numerous hotels in Bristol over the last year. I am a Marriott loyalty card holder, so prefer to stay with this chain for the points. But if the budget does not suit, I am afraid I have had to stay elsewhere - and it is quite an eye opener.  This Marriott, as is invariably the case, is of The Marriott Standard. The problem is, apart from the fantastically comfortable beds (I have never had a better night's sleep), the standard is in decline and the hotels in the chain and looking tired.  This is one of two Marriotts in Bristol. It is a short taxi ride from Temple Meads Station or a slightly longer one from Bristol Parkway. You can walk to the shops and restaurants very easily from it, in about five to 10 minutes. So the location is good.  The receptionist was exceptionally on the ball when I arrived - warmly welcoming me &quot;back&quot; to the hotel (although I had not stayed there for years). He also appeared efficient. I say appeared as he did forget to offer me a complimentary newspaper and he also promised I would get my bill under the door in the morning, but it never arrived and I had to queue to check out.  The room was large, but fully taken up by two double beds. It was nice to have had a welcome letter in my room, as well as some complimentary fruit and water. Unlike many hotels, the Marriott still also provides biscuits in the tea/coffee tray.   The room had a large and well lit desk to work at, an iron and board, a safe, a fridge and a chain on the door. The bathroom was cramped and, again, very dated. The bath took 20 minutes to run and even then it was only half full.  The room was clean but it had an odd odour.  The Exec Lounge, where I ate breakfast, was also run down. The choice was just about adequate, although the coffee was good. It had a computer, but the printer did not work.   The hotel does have a health suite: gym; pool; and spa. Alas, I was unable to use it on this occasion.  Come on Marriott - what is happening to you! Invest in your hotels or reduce your prices. Check out the competition… It will be quite an eye opener for you, too!"
-2; We used the hotel for an evening meal there was good an bad. Start of meal fro 20 - disorganised told start was to be delayed by 30 mins then the staff told us to go through to dining, The staff in the dinign room than asked us why we were sitting down early. The starter of salt beef looked like catfood and consisted of some grisley beef. The good bit was the main course of fillet beef - flavour and tenderness was second to none. My colleagues had lamb but their potatoes were served after they had eaten half the lamb. It also took three attempts to get the right bottle of wine, the red wine well above room temperature almost warm. Sweet was good.   Service at breakfast was equllay bad with coffee arriving after the english breakfast was served. At both meals the staff had a tendency to sling the plates down.   Room was good but other aspects of the service overcast the whole experience 
-2; Poor room. Carpet was ragged. Curtain surround splintered. Bed was comfy. Bathroom clean but there was no hot water at all! There are no phones in the rooms, and so calling reception was not an option. The hotel did refund 50% of cost which I felt was fair. The location is great for,theatre trips, but it isn't cheap and I recommend paying a little more for a good hotel. 
-2; Dined with friends at the Swan for a 50th Birthday celebration on Easter Saturday. Starters were fine but as they were cold, I was not expecting any issues. Main courses however were disappointing. My Cod was dry and curled up at the edges the two accompanying florets of cauliflower were also dry and over cooked. My wife had the chicken, which again was dry but the surprise was finding a 4 inch long piece of chorizo nestling under the vegetable mix. Unfortunately our friends dishes were disappointing for the same reasons and little to write home about. The restaurant was relatively empty with only around 6 covers and yet during our entire meal no staff member came over to check if everything was OK.  For the quality of service and the food, this was over priced and disappointing, especially when the main courses came with very little in the way of side dishes, which have to be ordered separately.  In the recent past, we have dined there on numerous occasions and the service and quality of the food has been good, but from our last experience I shall not be taking that chance again.  Disappointing for us and our friends celebration. 
-2; We stayed in a room with no air con and a shower not big enough to turn round in, on what was probably the most humid night of the year. To make matters worse we could not open the windows because of the noise, which was helped along by the less than considerate hen parties shouting and bawling into the early hours of the morning. Reception staff seemed to think we would have found a move of rooms acceptable in the middle of the night. Surely it is the responsibility of the hotel staff to control unruly guests and not punish guests who have paid good money by moving them to another room. We have stayed in several good hotels in Leeds, this is not one of them. 
-2; I know Brighton, in the summer, at the weekend, is likely to be pricey, but this just did not match up to what was paid. The AC was so noisy you had to turn off overnight. The sea view was great, but you had to peer through the bird muck on the window. I know there are lots of gulls, but the windows need cleaning a lot more than they are. And a really small thing, but if people are staying for two nights, top up the tea and coffee. If they drank it, they probably want some more for the second night!! Nothing fundamentally wrong, but I wouldn't revisit! 
-2; Problems from the beginning at check in booking could not be found ? Then was found confusion around payment . Room not very clean .lift broken. Bars closed to hotel guest for food and drink and problems continued to the check out. 
-2; We booked this hotel expecting a good room and facilities, The room was pokey - 4'6 bed, lighting unreadable. Bathroom OK but poor toiletries and no flannels. Room service non existent. It took until 5.pm with complaint to the concierge to get our room cleaned and bed made. Food in the carvery was dry and stale. Overall a 2 star experience at a 4 star price. 
-2; Staff very helpful don't know how they put up with stress of complaints Room tired but bed comfortable Lack of tissues and toiletries limited coffee although when a note left more provided Key to Broomfield for more than a day. very frustrating 
-2;" I booked this &quot;romantic break&quot; to clebrate my wife's 40th birthday. Keen to avoid dissapointment, and having stayed with Q-hotels many times, this seemed like the perfect venue; unfortunately it turned into one let down after another. The &quot;stunning entrance&quot;, was actually a fifteen minute traffic jam behind various limo's and alternative modes of transport used for a &quot;prom&quot;, but we put this behind us as we enjoyed champagne anc chocolates in our quaint feature room. Looking forward to our evening meal, I thought we'd got the wrong restaurant as the boisterous members of a sizeable wedding party, made the atmosphere more like Butlins than a four-star venue. Saturday arrived, and with the spa fully booked we decided to try the &quot;legendary afternoon teas&quot;, only to find these had already been reserved for another event/booking. Have to say, food was excellent, and the venue stunning, but the other events completely spoiled our stay. Maybe Q-hotels could have advised when I'd made the &quot;romantic&quot; booking? Would also have liked to give the management the opportunity to respond to this, but on departure, my card was swiped without even a &quot;hope you enjoyed your stay&quot;. "
-2; We booked this hotel as we had stopped there when it was owned by the Hilton, however on arrival it was clear to see it was a mistake, the hotel reception had lost our reservation, the rooms were no better, the beds were hard and had only 3 pillows. We then went in to the dinning room and had to wait over 2 hours for something to be served to us warm, after several attempts of trying to get the food correct we finally received something luke warm. I would advise anyone to stay away from this hotel as it has gone down hill since our last visit. 
-2; Was there to attend the Rambin Man Festival the room had not been updated since the hotel was built the paint work was dirty and there also a bad smell in the room. Never again will we stay in that hotel. 
-2; Staff were very nice & welcoming. The bed was very very hard & uncomfortable. No remote for TV so had none. Promised to move into another room but that didn't happen. Noise from club across the road was ridiculous. Dinner was nice. Did not receive complimentary drink as promised but on checking out early,was offered a free dinner to compensate bad experience. The staff was the best thing about this stay. 
-2;" When you think of 'Radisson' you think of 5 Star luxury, yes? Not here I'm afraid. The building itself looks impressive, and the lobby also looks the business. Unfortunately the moment you step out of the lift the experience quickly deteriorates: It smells fusty, the carpets are scraggy, the room was tired beyond belief. scratched tables, marked carpet, the TV was no bigger than 19&quot; and was modern in 2002 maybe.   The good bit: The view! That's about it.   I got a reasonable price but if I paid full price for my room I would have been seriously p****ed off.   Time for a refurb' Radisson!!? "
-2; We were put in a tiny room on the first floor, with a view of... another roof. This did not bode well. Over the course of the next 24 hours, we discovered that the staff are unfriendly to put it mildly, and I had to argue with the duty manager about a simple mistake on the dinner bill. The king size bed in this 'Superior' (superior to what, I wondered) room was too soft and sagged in the middle, so we both found it very difficult to get to sleep, aggravated by the creaky floor and heavy foot traffic outside.  The positives? They kitchen isn't bad, and we enjoyed a decent dinner, although the menu is not extensive, and nor is the wine list. Breakfast in bed was delivered promptly but getting cold.  Frankly, I found little to recommend this hotel. At the prices, they could do a lot better. 
-2; On visiting this hotel 22 years after I got married there I was looking forward to a pleasant stay. The room we were given was small but functional. It was a hot day and so the window was opened only to be met by a a/c unit drowning out our conversation. However our room did not have a/c and so the window need to be open. Catch 22. On returning to the hotel after our evening out we went into the bar and ordered a drink. To which I was told there was no real ale on . I then ordered 2 gin and tonics which were OK. The time was @ 10:20pm on returning at 10:40 for a refil I was told by the staff member that there was no ice and no lemon for our g&ts . As I enquired I was told that they start clearing away at 10:30 and that she had been working since 3pm. I made the point that that was not my problem and That when they charge 4star prices I expected 4 star service. she proceeded to tell me that if the management treated them better then maybe that would be the case . I then went to the reception to whinge and was told that there was no duty manager on that night . The lady was sympathetic and took my details but I have heard nothing from them. The whole place was being run on a shoestring and simply playing at being a 4 star hotel. I have stayed in and had far better service in 2 star places 
-2; The rooms are ok clean and tidy the food and the staff let it down the food was not up to standard of 2AA ROSETTES and need to be the thought the Rosette that was given to them in 2013 need to be taken away . Know for the staff I had asked for my bill to be email to me that was at 8 this morning and at 2pm I had to chase it and I asked for a break down of my bill .At this time I was told it can't happen so I ask to talk to the manager and I got a call back I explained to her and right away she email it to me .so why didn't the first person do it a wait of my time So bedroom ok but lots of great places to eat out     
-2; For £295 the room was OK. amenities limited and, frankly, this is a large amount of money even for London and more than the glorious St Pancras Renaisssance next door. The interiors were that kind of dull universal modern style, The fitness room was OK, but the sauna not up to temperature even by 9.30am(supposedly started at 6). I was astonished to find that breakfast was not included at this price and would cost an addtional £20. Really not good enough for the cost and thank heavens that someone else was paying for me! 
-2;" Postcode on hotel contact web page, when you put it into Google maps, takes you to the road with the staff entrance on. I asked a member of staff as she went into work if she could tell me how to get to the front. &quot;No,&quot; she said and shut the door in my face. I am afraid that this coloured my whole view of this establishment. "
-2; my wife and I decided to have an evening away in our old haunts in southport,saw this ''hotel''advertised and decided we could'nt go wrong with a sea front ''hotel''...how wrong we were.I so wish I had read some of the reviews.someone says 'ignore the reviews'.well do that at your peril...all the points made in these reviews are a true reflection of our experience at this ''hotel''.to add to these,I would like to comment on the so called decking at the back of the ''hotel''it was filthy and extremely dangerous with rusty 5 inch long screws sticking out all over the hand rails.and the smell of sewers was a lingering reminder of how unloved this place is...a great shame as it really does have the potential of a great place in a great location...I will finally add that we were pleasantly surprised with the very nice breakfast.will not be going back I am afraid. 
-2;Very unhappy with our stay. Bathroom had dirty tiles and mouldy grouting. The room itself was okay, nothing special, old school TV with terrible reception and sound. Breakfast and Dinner were good, but not of Hilton standard.
-2; You have to meet my expectations before you exceed them. Firstly staff at breakfast were slipshod and lazy. Taking me to the nearest table to them, that is making the minimal effort. Not checking I had all the cultery needed to eat my hot breakfast buffet. A fork was missing. Dropping my coffee off without checking there was sugar at the table. Lazy, disinterested, and made me feel like I had to ask for everything. Not very caring or homely. Shoddy really, and very two star. Breakfast was also disappointing, no fried eggs, no fried bread, and nothing really intersting. All help yourself a propeR bun fight with other guests. Secondly, I requested a late check out and was brushed off with a minimal extra hour, when the hotel was very definately not busy. I had the do not disturb sign on the door, and the housekeeper manager knocked and wouldn't go away until I answered the door. His reason for knocking to ask if I had arranged a late check out - i ask you how completely lazy not to bother calling the reception if that was all he wanted to know. Made my blood boil - so very lazy. Thanks for asking how you could exceed my expectations, I will post this on Trip Advisor so others can add their thoughts. 
-2;" The Bourne osterity drive can really be seen now. The butlins offer is significantly poorer that that of 2008. The traveling cast is still excellent but having to watch all of the shows in one night is a bit much. We stayed during the middle Xmas break and were disappointed because the evening entertainment was the same as we had on our July holiday at mine head. The evening ents was not geared towards Xmas at all. There is a noticeable drop in red coat numbers. 2 in centre stage all week. You can see that the business model has been changed to that of a haven holiday park. The food was nice although the &quot; premium dining &quot; experience feels like the cattle market of coral beach. They made an effort with regards to the festive decor. The Santa's grotto experience was forgettable and nothing like what they did in 2009. Giving a pound land selection box is v poor.The room was clean and tidy . I won't be doing their festive beak again. And because of the cheap skate ents guide I would recommend only going to butlins once a year. "
-2; We went for afternoon tea and frankly it was disappointing to find a lack of attention to detail. A generous pot of tea (enough for 3 cups at least) was spoilt by just the one tea bag floating in the water. When we asked for another tea bag the waiter brought us loose tea instead. The coffee was equally poor - again it looked and tasted like dish water when all that was required was an extra measure of ground coffee. With the drink situation eventually rectified, the sandwiches and cakes were brought to the table some 30 minutes later by which time we'd consumed nearly all the hot drinks with the remainder now cold. There is no excuse for such slow or poor service. That all the tables were occupied is not the problem of the guests and let's face it, how long does it take to make a few finger sandwiches and warm up some scones.The food itself was well prepared and nicely presented but the overall experience did not match the expectation of a very charming venue. Message to management - get involved in the small detail. 
-2;" When someone booked me into the Dolphin I was delighted to find it was part of the Accor Group. This group's hotels in which I have previously stayed have ranged from good to superb and I have never been disappointed.....until now! The Dolphin, now a shadow of its former self, seems little more than an over priced hostel for P&O cruise passengers and certainly not&quot; Port Out Starboard Home&quot;. My room was poorly maintained, the bed side light was loose on the wall and not working, the bath was old and it showed, the towel rail was loose and the bathroom door was split at the bottom. Good points. The bed was comfortable and Wetherspoons next door serve an excellent &quot;full English&quot; for £2.99, a fraction of the price of the hotel's breakfast. Next time it's the Premier Inn for me. "
-2;I booked here because it's convenient for an overnight stay before a morning flight. Never again. Long queue and over half an hour to check in. Long walk to the room, it's a huge hotel with an enormous new addition. Free wifi only in the public areas, otherwise £15, outrageous. Gin and tonic and some pork scratchings (which were soft), £10.75 Buffet dinner with a glass of wine £40. Reception atrium area old, dirty and dated.  Cost of room without breakfast £112 And it's not cheaper to book direct with Hilton, I got a cheaper deal through e-bookers.  Very disappointing.  
-2;Booked the Grand Royal for its location, On arrival we was told due to maintenance we were unable to stay at the hotel, But not to worry, we would put in a local hotel which is 5*, and is no more than 5-10 mins away, near regents park.On the way to the new hotel, taxi driver explains that we are the other side of London, which put a damper on the weekend break, I honestly believe that the hotel staff knew where they were sending us and what made it worse i think that ther was no maintenance problem, the hotel just over booked, Wouldn't consider this hotel again.
-2; Great views, dated rooms, tired decoration, shabby bathrooms and mould on the bread in the restaurant for breakfast, not what I expect for a supposed 4star property. 
-2; One of the reception staff was horrible and made me feel unwelcome. . This was depressing because I love Exeter.  I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. The room was too small for the price (GB Pound 85). The window would not open!  The only good thing was their breakfast. The location is good too, 
-2; Stayed there on a theatre break. Check in was efficient. Slightly dissapointed with the room. Having paid £190 B&B . Bathroom basin cracked. Had difficulty regulating heating. Bed seemed comfy enough. Breakfast was help yourself buffet. No fried eggs just rather dried up scrambled eggs. Almost choked on the mushrooms. Just could not figure out what the awfull taste was, certainly not mushroom. Asked waitress to investigate. She intially went away and then informed me that a new batch had been prepared. I sampled these which were just as awfull. She investigated again and then informed me that the 'Chef' was cooking them in worcestershire sauce. Overall, dissapointed with standard of breakfast. Location of Hotel excellant for theatre land. 
-2; Lovely rooms & great location for shopping,However don't be fooled by the doorman telling you a mini cab is cheaper than a Black Taxi. I made this mistake and got charged £150 to be taken to the Airport in a Toyota Prius. On my return I found out a black taxi would have cost over half that amount. Hotel working with Mini Cab company's to rip you off ? That's for you to decide, other than that it was a nice stay 
-2; We stayed in a Deluxe Room on the 2nd floor for 3 nights. We had no issues with the room itself, the bed was comfy and the aircon was effective and quiet. We were facing a busy street but the windows completely blocked all sound from outside. The location of the hotel is excellent, near Covent Garden and Leicester Square and in the middle of a beautiful boutique shopping district.  The room included a minibar but it wasn't stocked and we were told we had credit to fill the bar up. We thought this was strange considering the price we'd payed for a deluxe room. The tea and coffee making facilities weren't really what you'd expect for a 4 star hotel, there was a tiny kettle and a few tea/coffee sachets hidden in the wardrobe. At previous 4 star stays elsewhere we've had fully stocked espresso machines as well as complimentary snacks, both refilled daily at no extra cost. All we had here were two bottles of luke warm water.  Were things really fell apart was with our experience of the room service. After a late night out in London seeing a show and having some drinks we returned having completely skipped eating an evening meal. We decided to use room service to order some sandwiches up to the room, charging it to our room. First off when we phoned the number there was no answer despite letting it ring for around 2 minutes. We assumed they were swamped with Friday night orders so selected the callback option. Half an hour later there was no callback so we phoned again and this time someone answered, clearly the callback option did nothing then. We ordered two sandwiches one of which they didn't have ingredients for so we had to switch our choice. On the menu it stated they would be served in baguettes with side salads and kettle chips. When our orders arrived it was just sliced bread with a little salad in the sandwich and no sides at all. Instead they gave us large portions of mayonnaise and tomato sauce (slightly bizarre substitutions). The sandwiches were nice enough but they weren't what was advertised.  After eating the food we started getting ready for bed (around 1am) when we got a phonecall from the front desk saying we had no form of credit in place so they couldn't close the bill. We had paid for our rooms using a debit card. Annoyingly they had to send someone up to the room to take payment. When they arrived there were technicalities with the card reader because the order was not on their system. They had to return to the front desk to try and sort it. 15 minutes later around 1:30am they phoned again stating the only way to close the bill was for one of us to go down to the foyer to pay. At this point we were both dressed for bed and wishing we were asleep. We were amazed they wouldn't just settle the issue in the morning. Despite asking they insisted the bill was sorted that night as a separate team would be handling accounts the next day. This seemed completely against the point of room service as well as showing a lack of regard for putting customer's needs ahead of their own. Forcing guests to get dressed and walk to the front desk after 1am to pay ~£20 for some sandwhiches when staying in a 4* room that cost over £1000 is beyond a joke. When heading down we actually had to wait for around 5 minutes while the desk dealt with another guest who was angrily complaining she had phoned room service 6 times without answer to order 2 beers. She was suggesting they might like to give her the beers on the house but they were stone-cold refusing. To add insult to injury when we saw our room bill the next morning we noted they'd added a 12.5% optional gratuity onto the cost of those sandwhiches without ever asking us!  We will not be returning to the Radisson Blu Mercer Street due to the experience of that room service on top of a number of missing smaller comforts. 
-2; I first started staying at MacDonald hotels after a visit to Pittodrie House Hotel when the entire city of Aberdeen seemed booked up and the only option was to venture into the countryside. Pettodrie House was a revelation- relaxing with a drink before dinner in the library or a quiet conversation next to the fire. I went back every chance I got.  I spent a bit more to say at MacDonald Manchester hoping for a good stay, but it didn't happen. The hotel was in chaos with weddings, broken lifts, staff stretched beyond their capacity. Breakfast was a loud roar with the dining room full of boisterous students. Simple things like only one towel in the bathroom (I had to go routing through the room, dripping, looking for the other and finally found it on the safe) and no hair conditioner. Obviously none of these would be a big deal, but at £180/night your expectations go up a bit. I guess I just felt a bit stupid after the stay. 
-2;The hotel prides itself on its location, but at present it is a very active building site where they are adding a number of 'luxury' apartments and lodges to the development. Although it stands immediately above the 'private' beach, anyone can go to the beach and it is open to the public- certainly a lovely environment and with its own heated outdoor pool and fine restaurant, but for £260 per night including breakfast for two I would expect total pampering and faultless service. It is simply not worth this sum. Do not settle for Room 107 - dogs have bigger kennels, and the bathroom is equally tiny. Unfortunately the hot water supply failed on our last night and although it was restored the next morning, for this to happen in a supposedly high class hotel is unforgivable. The only plus side is the a la carte restaurant where food is excellent and service good. You can find much better value at a great many locations in Cornwall.
-2; The appearance of the hotel is good but the room I had was not good, both single beds were broken so could not sleep in either of them so had to sleep on the floor on night 1, the air con did not work, there were bear wires sticking out of the electric light mirror in the bathroom, reported the iisues to reception staff and although the beds were fixed for the 2nd night the air con was not, I was told that the temp must be set to 19c althrough the hotel for the air cont to work in my room, what a load of rubbish, i'm no air con engineer but even I know when I am being lied to, the menu options were very limited so we ate out, breakfast was ok but the sausages were not nice and the hash browns were almost raw. Staff were plesant and friendly but concidering the issues I had with the room offered an appology but that was it. i have stayed in may Best Western hotels in the UK and this was not one of the best unfortunately. 
-2; My wife & I stayed here as it was conveniently located for a wedding we were attending. There were though a series of shortcomings, some small & just niggling, other though more annoying. On booking in, I had to sign a credit card 'chit' for £30 more than than the agreed reasonable (£75) B&B price. It appears the hotel does not trust its customers not to abscond without paying their bills. In the morning on booking out, I signed a further chit for the pre-agreed £75, but was told I could not be given a chit cancelling the £105 signed the day before, but that 'it would not be used.' All this left a rather nasty taste in my mouth. Having booked in (at about 3pm) found our room not made up with bedding strewn all over the place, including the floor. Hardly hygienic. Luckily didn't matter as we only wanted to drop off our cases & head for the wedding. Curtains falling off their hooks & could not be closed properly. Bath plug hd no chain, so having had a bath you couldn't get the plug out of the plughole! Wanting a bath in the morning, I was therefore confronted with wife's cold water from night before. However, as there was no hot water in the morning perhaps this didn't really matter! Woken up at 1am. & kept awake for some time due to a very noisly party in the (I think) bar under our room. Breakfast. Had to wait (it was a Sunday morning) for 15 minutes for a table at breakfast. When we eventually were given one, not told what the breakfast system was, not offered tea/coffee, no jam etc or butter/marg on our table, self-service food hot dishes were not being replenished and the plates were cold. Finally, on booking out, asked to speak to 'the manager' but told as it was a Sunday there 'would be no one from the management' there until the next day. Overall, a well situated hotel, in a nice setting but one felt that perhaps over the weekend, it was deserted by 'management.' A pity. I did write to 'The Manager' about these points a couple of days after our visit, but have received no response to date. Rather a pity that what should be a pleasant place to stay, just wasn't when we were there. 
-2; I hadn't been to Durham since I graduated thirty years ago. Back then anything to do with the Royal County was a real treat especially going for dinner. I so looked forward to staying there.  The place is in urgent need of a refurbishment and whoever chose the lilac paint must have vision problems, it's insipid and awful. The room was shabby with staining on the walls and the bathroom needed a good clean.  The breakfast was mediocre, the staff attempted to be helpful but one member of the team in particular was so way over the top that her presence was almost intimidating, I appreciate she meant to be helpful but storming around the room in a pair of heavy boots is not what I expect at breakfast time. The dining experience in the evening was simply a disappointment, the food definitely was better when I was an under graduate.   In short, if you need to stay in Durham, go somewhere else, this place is not four star by a long shot - oh and I too object to the fee for the wi-fi, £15 is not a fee, it's theft. I pay less than that a month at home for an excellent service. 
-2; We paid £119 plus £5 parking on top for a one night stay (Saturday) We booked several weeks in advance, you cannot beat the location, in the grounds of the Cathedral, it is idealic, however the accommodation was very basic, . The room had no air con and it was a very hot day/night, there are no facilities, no bar or restaurant (or if there is, no one told us!) just a basic room, not even a chair, just a very small bench by the bay window, so if you wanted to watch any of the 4 channels on the TV it was very cosy!, I thought it was was very much in the line of a premier/traveller inn type hotel accommodation without doing them a misjustice. The room was small, the bed was small, no bath, a walk in shower, the bathroom, whilst clean, was only big enough for one at a time, we were next to reception and it was noisy during the night and also when they set up at 7.am. The Lodge is a conference centre, the accommodation would be perfect if you are on a course or at a conference, that is the type of room at the lodge. We felt the price was very expensive for such a basic room. The breakfast was disappointing too, there was plenty of it, but cold plates ( a cardinal sin!)  The staff were all lovely, polite and professional, however, I have stayed in far, far better rooms for less. I reckon £60 tops for that type of room. The view is worth a few bob, but that is it. 
-2; Me and my wife stayed for 4 nights 10th -14th They took a holding deposit £822.00 on arrival which they said would not be taken,well it was and i don't get it back till 5 days after departure,they also took full amount £772.00 on departure so in theory they have charged me twice which has come out of my bank which they 100% said it wouldn't,Because i have a bad chest i cant have the air-conditioning on so i always have the window open slightly which i couldn't as there are no windows in the rooms to open in the whole hotel which is crazy.i could have gone to cuba for a fortnight at this price. 
-2;"I booked this hotel for my partner and I for a three night break by the sea and did so on the basis of TA reviews. Having now just got back, and read some of those reviews again, I am wondering if some people are too easily pleased, or if we are just too demanding.  We stayed in a luxury garden room. Was it luxurious - I would say not. Yes, the bed is king size and comfortable; the TV screen is large - but only a handful of free view channels are available. There are no windows, so you cannot have fresh air on a hot night unless you leave the french doors open, taking a hell of a chance on security. There is no air conditioning and no room safe. Bath Robes are there, but not slippers. Gels and shampoos are provided, but not soap or face towels, nor are there glasses in the bathroom for rinsing after washing teeth.   A kettle and Nespresso machine are in the room but only two pods/sachets of ordinary and decaf coffee per day per couple. Really? And the prices of the items in the &quot;larder&quot; are outrageous.  This lack of generosity of spirit seemed evident throughout our stay in the hotel. We dined in on the first night and yes the food was good - what there was of it. Every course served in huge soup type plates with a little food stacked in the middle. What I refer to as &quot;Nouvelle Poncy&quot; and vastly overpriced. A thimble full of wine for £8.50!  The included continental breakfast is frankly awful for a hotel that has such high pretensions. No croissants, no danish, no cheeses or cold meats. Cook your own toast when there is bread available - they always seemed to be running out. Home made spreads that were quite tasteless. Filter coffee is included but if you want a cappuccino, that is extra, as is anything hot, and this when you are paying over £200 a night. This is hospitality?  So, maybe we are demanding, but if other hotels can provide real, first class hospitality for a lot less, so should The Gallivant."
-2;My girlfriend and i stayed for only one night and were really disappointed with the hotel. Its suppose to be a four star hotel, i would give it a 3 star. The only 4 star about the hotel would be the lobby. Don't be fooled by the nice pictures on internet because the rooms don't match.  The King size bed - it was not a king size bed it was two King singles pushed together that was uncomfortable to sleep on. Especially this middle where the beds meet.  On to the room service - I ordered a BLT sandwich that said on the menu that it was 9 pounds, little did i know that it also cost an extra 5 pound to be delivered to your room. So really the BLT was 14 pounds. (you would think that paying 125 pounds a night for a room that the service to bring food to your room would all be included. NO  The day of check out - We had to check out by 12pm. At about 10.30am we had a knock at the door, as soon as i heard the knock the lady let herself straight in while me and my girlfriend were in our room. I found this to be completely uncomfortable and intrusive. THAT IS A BIG NO NO. The lady was not apologetic at all and still continued to ask me when were checking out so she could sort the room out. I am not happy at all.  The only thing that i could compliment would be the breakfast, it was a good feed.  But nothing makes up for being walked in on by a staff member. She's lucky we weren't naked! still not good enough.  I feel like the money we paid for this night has gone completely to waste and i walked out this hotel upset and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I have stayed at Hiltons all over the world and this Hilton certainly does not live up to its reputation and name. Never staying at a hilton again!
-2; Booked a family room for 3 adults for 2 nights got a double bed and a bunk bed for £550 quid I got stitched up like a cookie rooms are not worth £40 quid a night hotel mega dated what a waist of location wants knocking down a premmier inn would put it to shame will always go to sandbanks but will never stay in that hotel again. 
-2; My family and I stayed overnight at this hotel on September 21st. The website portrayed the hotel as being special with an interesting history, thats why we booked this. The reality is it's an overpriced hotel that is very dated and has no atmosphere. We booked a deluxe room only to find the carpet had a large rip, the furniture was of poor quality and the cold tap on the bath was seized, so having a relaxing bath at the end of the day was not possible. We did reserve a table for the Saturday evening, but then we realised only two other tables we being used, we decided to go and find a restaurant in Weybridge and I'm glad we did. I would not recommend this hotel, you will find many other hotels are in the area offering better quality and at a lower price. 
-2;My son and I turned up for England's opening match of the 2016 Euros having pre-booked only ro be informed that the event had been cancelled. The receptionist was extremely friendly and polite but completely in the dark and thought it was a technical problem with the screen. She thought that everyone that had pre-booked had been informed. no we had not. The manager was not available but at lewst I was given a refund.  NOT THE BEST WAY TO RUN AN EVENT.  The manager has so far not responded to 3 e-mails.
-2;This hotel is over priced, and not worth staying at. Rooms are very dated (mine was an 'executive one') and not what you would expect for the money. Service was mixed. Having looked again, there are many other hotels close by that are better and much cheaper.
-2; Booked 2 single rooms to keep my best mate company (groom) . We turned up at this very nice looking hotel and the reception was very clean with a bar being the first thing you see as you walk in. We were told our rooms were on different floors (even though I booked 2 rooms at the same time) ok I thought when I found out I had been upgraded to a double. Well we went to there first bedroom (single) to drop off my mates stuff then to mine. Both rooms were slightly different as mine had a larger area and a double bed and both looked into the middle void where the fans and air con units were. No view apart from other windows. We went to the bar and had a drink before going to TGI Fridays for dinner. When we returned we had another drink then went to our rooms. WOW it was like there heating had been turned on. The rooms were so hot and the noise from the fans was unbearable. I tried opening the window a bit more but the restrictor didn't allow me but the teaspoon holding the window open fell out of place. A TEASPOON ! I finally fell asleep in the heat. The bed was comfortable and I think I had a good night's sleep waking about 630 to the humming of fans. I took a photo of the teaspoon and went for a shower to see the curtain rail hanging off the ceiling. WOW this is a 4 star ?? My best mate in the other room didn't have a good night sleep either with the noise and as he was a floor below me this noise was louder. I had to get a few things done in the morning prior to his wedding so we left heading to a cafe for breakfast. Now the hotel looks really nice and clean at the front with loads of parking. The inside is very clean and looks quite expensive but the rooms were had were tired and old looking. They need work done to them. Not very happy with this stay at all 
-2; Stayed with my girl for our anniversary. Booked a 'feature room' more about that in a bit. Great location on a large square in Kings Lynn, an easy walk to the shops and to the Quay side, lovely cafe on water front, so all good. Parking a little disconcerting as behind hotel on a side street, felt that it lacked any security other than barrier. No CCTV evident. The Turners Restaraunt served great food, tho service did not quite match the price or food quaity. pleaseant enough but when the waitress needs the number on the menu not the dish felt a bit like a takeaway. Don't think silver service training has quite reached these parts but I think leaning over a diner is a not recommended at any level.  We had a few drinks which were not overpriced, and went into a pub 2 doors down to catch some live music. So plenty to drink and a late night all going well. Right up to the plumbing banging and popping at around 2am. We managed a couple of hours but it got ridicoulous by 5am. I went down to reception at around 6 and spoke to duty receptionist, who informed me they had problems with it in the past on the rooms at the front of the hotel! Asked when duty manager was in and arranged ot speak to them at 7am. Back down at 7 spoke to a lady who was I felt pretty hostile to the complaint, and when I raised the query that this was not the first problem they had had, she said it was with another room, and needed to come and listen. She came up to the room, didn't have to wait long as it was about every 3 minute and agreed it was unacceptable. Told us she would contact some manager or other. When we came down she offered us a complementary breakfast which we accepted, and that we would be contacted after the weekend by a director. Needless to say no call, no contact and no real apology.  In my experience of travelling things can and do go wrong, what makes aplace recommended or to be reurned to is how those 'go wrongs' are dealt with. In this instance very very badly. Would I recommend... No Value for money .... Not for £150 a night, thank goodness we only booked for one, and held off on the 2nd and 3rd night. 
-2; We stayed here last Saturday night. We were child free so we thought we'd treat ourselves to the Village Hotel rather than the cheaper alternative next door.  We had room 239 which is decorated in a dark browny grey colour, has minimal lighting and bizarre design features like sloping bedside tables that deposit poorly placed items back in bed with you. OK for a book but not a cup of hot coffee.  The room like much of the hotel needed a good clean. The carpets had some dubious stains on them and hadn't been vacuumed between guests. There was mould round the bath, the TV remote control (which didn't work) had a grey grunge round the buttons and the room service menu was sticky and covered in a child's scribbles. The partly melted phone was interesting.  The most disappointing aspect of the room was the bedding. Our sheets has holes in them and the pillows were really uncomfortable. Thin and rock hard. I woke up at 3am and didn't get much sleep after that.  We would have mentioned this to the reception staff only when we checked out they were terribly busy looking at something on the computer and didn't look up!  The only redeeming feature of this place is the gym. Friendly staff, great equipment and not very busy first thing in the morning.  On reflection, the cheaper place next door would have been better. 
-2; Having stayed many times at this hotel, I was, like my six collegues extremely disapponted with our stay. This unfortunately was purely down to the restaurant and kitchen staff. The bedrooms however were first class. Nicely appointed with excellent showering facilities and the room spotlessly clean. Evening meal was very expensive and unsubstantial, steaks were overly fatty bordering on uneadible. Service was also very poor with members of our party finished before others had been served. breakfast was a total disaster with the staff and kitchen unable to deal with service for 5 tables. By 7.45 am fruit and morning juices were finished. My own request for poached eggs took 25 minutes to appear but ineadibly served on wet bread as opposed to toast. After the previous evening's poor dining experience this was too much. 
-2; I booked this hotel as a crash in London after an evening event because of it's convenient location so we viewed the venue as a crash pad nothing more. My partner checked in and I arrived much later.  The hotel is really well located for central London and was very easy to get to.  The reception wasn't fantastically sign-posted but it's compact size meant I didn't have far to look for the desk to collect my key. However this is where the positivity of the experience ended. The room was in the basement, which in principle I have no problem with, but until midnight I could hear the Underground trains rolling beneath us and I was awoken the next morning to the sound of deep rumblings.  The bath/shower was a nightmare/dangerous to get in or out of because of it's ridiculous height above the floor (and I am a tall man!). The bedroom was very spacious, but this was because the bed was only suitable for a child and NOT two adults. The décor was pleasant if not a little worn in places. The windows were a little draughty and not very ecologically friendly.  I can't recommend this venue because they have such rooms, I doubtless accept that everyone who has not stayed in the basement will have had a good stay but we did not. If a venue is to be assessed it must mainly be on the quality of sleep and we did not have a good nights sleep. 
-2; Firstly, I have waited about a week before publishing this as I wanted to see if the feedback I left at the hotel reception would be acted upon - sadly it seems it has not been as I have not been contacted and I expressed that I wished to be.  I have stayed at The Green House probably 4-5 times prior to this, the location is great, staff are very helpful and the decor is very well finished - there is no arguing that the whole place does have a nice atmosphere/feeling about it. But the place does have a huge problem with sound proofing.   However, last time I stayed at this hotel I was woken at around 03:30 by someone blowing their nose in bed in the room behind mine, I kid you not the walls between the rooms are that thin. After this the person in the room next door decided to make themselves a cup of coffee, after opening the wardrobe to remove the kettle and plug it in it actually sounded like it was in my room - because the walls are so thin. This seemed to have a knock on effect, as now the people upstairs had been woken and were walking around their room, flushing toilets etc, nothing unreasonable if the rooms were adequately sound proofed...which unfortunately they are not. To top it off my room was right next to the staircase, Bay, and every time someone walked up or down the stairs it resonated around my room.  Paying over £150 for a room, where you get woken up in the early hours by people doing normal actions (certainly not anything that could be considered unreasonable) is not acceptable. It is all very well having flash bathrooms and fancy decor, but if the hotel doesn't do what it says on the tin - i.e actually permit you to get a decent nights sleep - then it is money down the drain as far as I'm concerned. I challenge any of the managers or owners to stay in that room - Bay - and get a reasonable nights sleep, before it is suggested I'm not a particularly light sleeper either!  I'd rather stay at a Travellodge next time and whilst it won't be a 'listed building' - which seems to be the excuse that was given by reception - the bathroom won't be as flash... I'm sure I'll get a better nights sleep. It is a shame as I've just bought a property in Westbourne and will be in Bournemouth at least once if not twice a week for the next few months, but sadly after the last experience I will not be staying at The Green House. 
-2; Last Friday the 6th November 2015 my Wife and I stayed at the Midland Hotel in Manchester taking advantage of a package deal including use of the spa, dinner and breakfast for our wedding anniversary. We arrived early at the spa and descended via an opulent Victorian staircase into the basement spa, where we were greeted with soothing chill out music and the exotic scent of aroma therapy oils. The masseuse that greeted us pleasantly at reception, told us our package included lunch and we selected the Midlands take on a Northern Cream Tea (including Vimto Jelly). The massage treatments and the relaxation room where great and continued the Midlands opulent Victorian theme. Unfortunately the cream tea was more Faulty Towers than Midland. The Cream Tea was waiting in its bespoke presentation case as we were escorted to our lunch table, only on serve cross examination did our waitress divulge the content of our sandwiches, our waitress then retired after taking our tea and coffee orders (returning 20 minutes later with half a cup of cold coffee and a small pot of tea).   A further 20 minutes passed as the relaxation began to wear off! Before we managed to catch the eye of a different surly/grunting member of staff and made our outlandish requested as to the where about of the missing cream, Jam and butter (from our cream tea.)   The response was “I don’t know” and “I don’t know if the hotel has any Jam, butter or cream”. Our unhelpful waitress then went off for a further 20 minute treasure hunt before returning with the jam butter and cream. We then booked into the Hotel, the foyer and our room continued the grand Victorian theme and we headed down to Mr Coopers for a pre-dinner drink and looked forward to our meal anniversary. The staff in the bar and bistro where very helpful and courteous, but my wife’s main course continued the Faulty Towers theme, her chicken pasta was inedible. The chicken breast and thigh had the consistency of a comedy rubber chicken, the vegetables were in edible and the dish was swimming in grease.  Our romantic break was let down by the food and I think next year we will try out the competition. 
-2; We paid one of our occasional visits to this delightful setting for lunch, as we have been doing for over 20 years. We were horrified by the change. Sausage and mash for £12.95! So we both had a ploughmans, which sadly turned out to be a triumph of style over substance, 1 small half slice of less than appetising bread (although more was delivered when asked for) an equally small piece of cheese and a charred chunk of lettuce which was warm and limp. With so many good places to eat in the locale it will not be a surprise that we will think twice before returning. 
-2;" Spent my fifth night in the Sofitel on Thursday 11th September 2014. I choose this hotel time and time again when flying from Heathrow, due to the closeness to the Terminal, the attitude of the staff and cleanliness of the hotel, none of which can be faulted. Check in was smooth as usual, but I'd love to be offered an upgrade from the the &quot;classic&quot; room, which is still extremely comfortable. Check out early on Friday morning was very quick and efficient. You simply can't fault the Sofitel for their layout of the place, the tolietries in the room and the ambience in the bar. Can't wait for my next visit, but please offer me an upgrade lol :) "
-2; My wife and I decided on Chester for a short break to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversay on the recommendation of our daughter who had previously stayed at the Abode Hotel in Chester, unfortunatley this was fully booked and we had to stay elsewhere.  Ideally located for short break in Chester, we decided on the Broojk Mollington. Distance to Chester approx. 5 mins by car or 30 mins walk. Grounds were superb, unlike reception. Poor communication between reception staff and the rest of the hotel. We had 3 breakdowns in communication during our four night stay. The first was the initial booking which we chose to do online. The hotel sent us an email to say the booking had been confirmed, and requested payment. When we phoned to pay, the hotel had no record of online booking, and the on-duty receptionist booked it in manually during the call. Eventually an email was recieved to confirm booking had been accepted. The second, my wife was booked into a spa deal which she enjoyed, but lack of communication between reception staff and spa meant a hassle when she arrived at the spa and had to re-book on the day after already paying upfront. The third, the reception failed to tell us to keep re-booking times for our evening meals, which as simple as it may sound, it caused a bit of bother on the Saturday night as was almost already fully booked. When chatting to the friendly staff, it became apparent that the hotel as a whole does not communicate between areas.   Food was a major let down. In the four days we stayed, the menu changed by one item per main meal. Lucky we weren't vegetarian, as the same choice appeared for 4 days. The hotel itself needs refreshing, looks very tired and appears they are not re-investing the money they charge, back into their hotel.  Don't let this put you staying off in Chester as this is a beautiful city, but we would not stay in this hotel again, unless drastic improvements had been implemented. 
-2;Everything adequate , food and drink pricey and slightly remote without any scenic delights to compensate.Wouldn't take my wife and family but serves its purpose as a conference venue. For the conference extra staff drafted in and were well organised.
-2;I booked a Strictly Come Dancing experiance break as a surprise for my wifes 50th birthday as she loves the program. We even took dancing lessons so we could enjoy the dancing. To say we feel disapointed is an understatement. On arrival it had the wow factor with large pictures of past couples on the program and some of the dresses on manikins. We were met in the impresive entrance with some fizzy wine and i thought Brownie point for me as my wife was very impressed. Unfotunately thats where the good bit ends. The food in the main resturant was not good with powderd mash and yorkshire puddings of the Aunt Bessy sort. The tables are very close together. We had dirty cups and cuttlery at breakfast. We had ham sandwiches at lunch on the terrace outside the ham was the cheap slimey stuff. The room could have been cleaner with fluff in quite few places and dirty marks on the bathroom ceiling. Most of the things that i have stated so far are small stuff on there own not worth complaining about but with so many and i could go on. By far the bigest thing that spoiled it for us was the meal in the Terace resturant which had a very limited menu so much so that in a resturant that had just been awarded a second AA roset the only main course my wife fancied was steak and chips. Our main courses took ages to arrive so much so that the matre de apolagised twice and offerd us a free bottle of wine. When they did arrive my wifes steak which she had asked for medium rare was a thin very over cooked tough and dried steak. She sent it back leaving me to finish my meal alone. then i sat there watching my wife eat hers by which time she had gone past enjoying it. Bearing in mind this was a surprise for my wife 50th birthday and a day after our anniversary. Now to the entertainment. The theatre can not hold the number of guests staying in the hotel and you are packed in. One of the main reasons i booked this break was that Flavia and Vincent from Strictly were there to dance. They were on th dance floor for about 40 minutes including Vincent talking while Flavia Changed three times, they did four dances and went. I thought they were having a break but that was it. The compere would be more suited to Butlins he was cheasey with a day glow fake bake trying to get the happy campers shaking hands. This as well with the BBCs name attached to it.  All this with the age of a good majority of the guests quite a bit more than us we felt a bit like we were in an old peoples home not a four star hotel. On Sunday we as my wife put it escaped to York for the day. The main areas of the east wing are shabby and tired. A shame as i paid nearly £900 for a three day break we feel it was not good value and the hotel has so much potential. All the staff we came accross were very polite and helpful, the room was nice altough a bit dusty, the view from our room was good. Craig Reval Horewood was very entertaining trotting all catch frases, it was just a lot of things added up made this not the experiance i expected.
-2;Restaurant has no choice for veggies ... Just one veggie starter and one veggie main, and that's it. And neither of them were very palatable. It's like going back to the 1990s. Shame because the hotel rooms and ambience are good.
-2; Room was internally-facing and had effectively no window so ventilation was a real problem. TV reception extremely poor and no mobile phone signal (Orange/EE) in the room. Restaurant and lobby staff were helpful and check-in was efficient. 
-2; on arrival i was given my room No 18 the gothic suite...words failed me on entering the room, i thought they were taking the mick out off me...probably the worst decor for a suite you could think off...yes i took photo's, i immediately went to reception and asked to change the room as i was far from happy...they did room 22 a lot better (could it get any worse). the room was better only two towels no glass for rinsing your mouth, the shower head leaked, the radiator didn't work in the sitting area, the mini bar was empty,(not even a bottle of water)...the whole room poorly decorated, also i was informed when i booked the room there was a 10% discount as i was part of a wedding party but never recieved it...was just glad to get out and home 
-2; I used to dine here under previous owners and it was a class act.As I needed to stay in the area with my wife recently I decided to stay here and eat in the hotel restaurant.Now I hadn't been here for several years but driving up to the hotel all looked well and it is a truly striking building.Checking in was fine and as we had a dog we where given a ground floor room.The room was a little tired but all ok.We had booked dinner for 7.30 and arrived for a pre dinner drink a little before then.We were seated in a small side room with 10/15 other people and waited forever to get a drink.The fire was unlit(outside temperature below freezing) and atmosphere poor.Drink arrived but despite several requests no menus.Eventually moved to another bar by the conservatory and after further wait found some menus.The problem was soon obvious.2 staff covering bar and restaurant service for 40/50 people.Eventually sat down for dinner at 9pm and have to say food and service then ok. We were somewhat disappointed that such a super place has detiorated so much over the years.The place is tired and has had no upgrading since the new owners came a few years ago.How you can run a place like this with such few staff is a mystery.If you get a cheap deal it is worth staying but perhaps eat somewhere else. 
-2; What would have been an acceptable stay with friendly staff was blighted by very poor bar service on both nights. We were among many guests left in the bar without pre-dining drinks or menu for up to half an hour. Several people (myself included) complained while we sat and waited. The whole bar-restaurant process is a shambles: Food service was slow and had to be re-prompted by several people. The after dinner coffee we ordered one night never arrived. 
-2; Great location just off Piccadilly and across from Green Park tube station, I arrived at the hotel and checked in at the dated reception.   My rate was an extortionate £235 per night, so I was upgraded to an Executive room. The room was just OK. Large bed with pillow choice, grubby sofa bed, safe, iron, old style sliding mirror wardrobe, net curtains and coffee making facilities. No free WiFi.   The cramped bathroom was dated, over the bath shower and taps with the chrome wearing off. A bath robe was provided, I guess this and the complimentary bar of Kit-Kat were the executive extras, plus the view of the Ritz across the road. Toiletries were basic.  The bar and public areas were dated, as was the dining area (a breakfast area next to the old wooden bar), which served an OK breakfast at sole less tables with no windows.   The rooms are typical and the general areas need a refurb. For the price paid I won't return, unless I get a deal for around half the cost I was charged.   
-2; Unfortunately a basic error and how it was subsequently handled tarnished our visit to this hotel. Our starter of fish cakes was not properly cooked and in the centre there were still ice crystals. We raised this discreetly with the waiter and his initial reaction was to question this - not very professional and just compounded their error. He did then take the dishes back to the chef and subsequently apologised. We were offered a replacement which we declined. Rest of meal was fine but the meal will be remembered for all the wrong reasons. And sadly on our departure the next day no apology and/or recompense by the hotel management. 
-2; I have to admit to knowing this hotel when it first started out many years ago as the Brigate Lodge and since then it has grown and changed hands and now promises 4 star luxury and standards.  Unfortunately the hotel does not deliver on many fronts with the staff being friendly but not efficient and most certainly not in tune with the customers needs. Menu items are not as described and the presentation is haphazard.  The hotel claims 4 stars but I suspect this is because of the range of facilities rather than on the quality of the accommodation and care and attention of the staff. Whilst I did not play golf this time, I can say that the course similarly promises much but fails to deliver which is a crime as when it first opened it was a 'must play' course but no more.  The hotel itself and its grounds promises so much and I was really let down and if I have to put my finger on it, it is the staff who really don't seem to have much passion and this can only come from the top. Tired rooms I can live with if the staff are great, menu discrepencies in a 4 star hotel show a slack kitchen and the poor service we experienced just finished off a bad job.  Shame, a real shame. 
-2; We got off to a bad start with bus to airport not turning up and staff having to ring for a taxi on 14/10 /2014. but on our return 21/10/2014, after having problems at the airport, special assistance being non existant, resulting in my wife having to walk the full length of the airport. On arrival at the hotel we had been booked into a single room, when I had booked a double, but we were soon shown to a double room, but at 0200 all we wanted was to make a quick cup of coffee and turn in as by this time my wife was not well after the airport experience , but the kettle didn't work, so we made do with a glass of water. On getting up a few hours later the room was cold, which was soon rectified, and also a new kettle was supplied. I can't fault the staff they were very good. But I don't think I will be using this hotel again. 
-2; The web site promised an impressive hotel. The reality fell short of my expectations. A good location close to the beach. Impressive dining room, bar and lounge. Excellent breakfast and service. But cramped accommodation with no soundproofing from the plumbing and movements in the room above on creaking floorboards, resulting in a disturbed night's sleep. Spa facilities (especially the swimming pool) too crowded. 
-2; My wife and I stayed for two nights for a wedding 2 weeks ago and while we really loved the whole contemporary vibe of the hotel and the grounds, we were very disappointed in our room (room 31) which is promoted as a superior room and which we paid a lot of money for.  Soundproofing in the lower ground floor rooms is appalling and we were kept awake by the upstairs rooms’ deafening plumbing, toilet and bath emptying into the early hours.  Then we were woken up both mornings at 7.00am by automated alarm calls that we hadn’t ordered and were assured wouldnt happen again after the first morning.  I would struggle to recommend this hotel as value for money and if you want a precious weekend away from the kids, think twice about this hotel.  You’ll also find it hard to actually find a member of management to register a complaint with too.   I think the standards must be slipping here. 
-2; We chose this hotel over Hotel Du Vin just to try something different at around the same price level. We stayed in the hotel on a Saturday night and checked in in the early evening.   I later found out there was some sort of event on in the bar that night, which partly explains why we were rather aggressively accosted by a suited doorman demanding our name to check off on his clipboard before we were barely out of the revolving doors. This, combined with the starkness of the entrance hall, didn't set us up with a very good welcome.  We had opted for the standard room - it looks nice on the website. But it's really all window dressing and just not as well designed as it could be.  Bad points of the room were as follows: - There are no blinds or sheer curtains so even in daylight, if you want privacy, you have to draw the dark blackout curtains. I don't see why they don't put a frosting on the windows (unless other guests particularly enjoy the view of roadworks, multi storey carparks or block of flats around 20 metres away opposite looking in to the windows?!) - The shower water pressure is pitiful and the water doesn't get hot enough. A really unsatisfying shower in what appears to be a fairly decent bathroom. - The double beds have a join in the middle (ie two singles pushed together topped with a mattress topper which you can feel the join through) - The bed sheets are not 100% cotton, they have a high content of man-made fibres, which makes them feel rough and bobbly and not luxurious at all. Horrible in fact.  - The kettle hadn't been emptied before our arrival (ok so we don't all empty our kettles at home, but in a hotel you expect it to be empty so you can use your own fresh water) - The decor is meant to look designer and high-tech but our TV wasn't working (the hidden digi-box had been switched off by an unmarked button on the remote control). - The anglepoise lamp on the desk, meant to look all modern and posh - doesn't actually angle. It's fixed (ie cheap), so if you want to use the space on the desk you have to pick the whole lamp up to turn it around.  - There isn't a clear Welcome Guide or any kind of room guide with room service details etc. It takes a while to find the one on the TV as you aren't told about it anywhere. If it was on a welcome homepage when you arrive this problem would be solved.  - If you have a room near the lift, like we did, beware of noise during the night by the heavy doors from the lift area banging. We were woken at 2am and again at 2.30am by noise from drunk people in the corridors.   The good points: The breakfast was OK - fresh juices, nice jams and pastries, and the quality of the ingredients for the full english breakfast seemed good.  Checkout was quick using the checkout machines in the lobby.  In summary, it just isn't as nice as it looks, and isn't as good as it could be. It feels like they ran out of money after they'd bought all the touch screen telephones and click-wheel style light switches, and then had to go for cheaper furniture.   Compared to other value designer hotels, Hotel La Tour was disappointing on several levels. I would not recommend it and would not return. 
-2;The hotel offers an impressive external facade, although the internal decor is showing signs of tiredness. The front desk staff were well organised and helpful. We attended a charity dinner function with good food and service. Unfortunately the whole event was spoilt by a rude and unhelpful late duty manager. A letter of complaint didn't even receive a response and it took another 2 prompts before I even received an acknowledgement which gave the impression of being disinterested and appeared to be, more or less, a 'standard' letter. My reply was treated in the same manner and after 3 chasers from me I felt frustrated enough to write to an 'executive' of the Accor Group in Paris. Miraculously I then received a reply from Customer Relations but 2 months later am still waiting for a reply from Paris!! Over the years I have stayed in many Accor Hotels across the World, from Sofitels through to lesser brands and have previously been happy. Accor have much competition and as a result of a 'take it or leave it' attitude from their top management I shall be using alternatives provided by the competition in future,
-2;" Stayed on mon/ Tuesday this week. Hotel nice enough, rooms ok. Ordered food in restaurant and asked for a small change to the menu- no salad on burger and peas instead of coleslaw - much tooth sucking from server- said he would ask. Food arrived , salad on burger, no peas, no coleslaw, no chips ( it comes with chips). Told waiter I had asked for no salad - he offered to take it off, I said no problem I would do it. Waited 5 minutes and asked him where the rest of my dinner was - he asked what it came with( shouldn't he know!) chips arrived immediately- i asked about the peas- apparently the chef couldn't swap them for coleslaw without charging me- really?? Had to eat there again the second night but that was ok ( I chose pasta so the chef wouldn't be challenged). Breakfast was nice but a bit hit and miss with the staff not understanding english properly I.e people asking for marmalade and getting marmite. Wifi slow and phone reception poor which is unavoidable but doesn't help.But the thing that made me write this was when I was asked on check out how my stay was and I replied &quot; ok&quot; in a way that should have rang some bells the receptionist said &quot; thank you&quot; !!! Amazing and cemented the fact that the staff aren't bothered about the customers. "
-2; I stayed here because I was working at the nearby studios and found it all felt a bit tired and old. The room was supposed to be 'executive' or deluxe, not sure of their phrasing, but it certainly wasn't. As I was shown to the room, the carpet in the hallway was filthy, leaves everywhere and two fold up beds outside my room that nobody had bothered to move. Then inside the room, there were several month and even a few ants. It was on the ground floor, so I guess these things happen but for £100, I won't be returning.   On the good side, I found the service to be excellent and the staff most pleasant. The breakfast is also very good. If they update the hotel and showed it some love, then it will be much better value. 
-2; After having read the reviews we were really worried as we had booked inadvertently without checking. So I phoned and mentioned my concern about such awful reviews and was promised a quiet room. He mentioned the hotel was rustic and not everybody likes that so we assumed rustic meant rustic - rusty would be more appropriate! To be absolutely fair our room was quiet - but it was a pokey little room with a very old fashioned, albeit clean, bathroom with a separate toilet and no wash basin! The doors were badly painted and the locks were something you might find on very old public conveniences and you had to run the water for ages before you received hot water. It was not possible to alter the height of the stuck shower head!. The bed itself was very comfortable despite the fact that it was difficult to manoeuvre around because it took up most of the room. Having said all the above, we did have a comfortable quiet night but it is certainly not good value and needs a massive over hall to command the prices they do. 
-2; I have visited Hill Valley every year for the last 6 years, other members of our group over 20 years. This could well be the last which would be a shame as it has become of a tradition. Our party had played golf on the way down to Hill Valley and for most of us a good soak in the swimming pool and spa would have gone down a treat. Unfortunately the pool was closed and so we would have to make do with a few beers in the bar prior to dinner. On arrival we were told we could only use our discount card in the 'Masters Bar'. This wouldn't have been a problem but there was only one member of staff in there, no glasses and no draught beer. I tell a lie, there was beer but it was warm and flat. Not the best of starts. There was a nice addition to the bar from last year - a snooker table. Great we can have a game while waiting for the staff to bring up drinks from the downstairs bar. Balls and cues available from reception with a £10 deposit. No chalk and no scoreboard.  Down to the restaurant for dinner and the service, I use that word grudgingly, was poor. No one asking if we would like drinks or wine with the meal. Starters brought out for the group of 18 10-15 mins apart. We had pre-ordered so shouldn't have been too difficult but the staff began to serve another group who had arrived, surely it would be better to finish one group before starting on the rest. Breakfast the following morning was fine, although as a previous reviewer has commented, the food was very greasy. Evening meal on the Saturday night was to be in a function room rather than the restaurant, we didn't mind that but I think we felt we were a minor distraction to the hotel who were hosting a wedding that day and night. We were served bread rolls with the starters but we had to request butter on four occasions. It finally came in the shape of a small bowl covered with a nice stainless steel bowl. On lifting the lid we were faced with one 2cm cube of butter, for 18 people! I do have to say that the standard of the rooms and the facility as a whole is excellent and the reason we return year after year. This year, however, just seemed to be one little niggle after another. The golf course in the past has always been very enjoyable to play. We appreciate the weather has been tough this winter for greenkeeping staff but the state of the course was very poor. It is easy to blame the weather but in this case I think it would be an excuse as opposed to a reason. The course is looking very tired and very untidy. In my opinion it is in need of serious investment or Hill Valley will very quickly lose the custom of golfing groups like ours who return faithfully year on year.  The cost of drinks alone would bring in more than enough revenue to ensure work can be carried out. I do think the management need to have long hard look at how much business they actually lose by over pricing. Price competitively and you will certainly sell more and make more profit in the long run. Will we return again next year? I think the answer could well be no. 
-2; With such a brilliant location the service and quality of the accomadation was disappointing. No wardrobe or drawer space in first room allocated. It was apparent we were a nuisance when we asked to be moved to another room. Breakfast at £15 was very average, not very good quality food. Food in general overpriced for quality. 
-2; Lets start with the good things - the room was OK, at the front with great views out to see. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. However the bathroom was tiny, the shower was feeble, the hot/cold water control did not work, nor did the shower gel dispenser. Then there was the breakfast (included in room price), poor cold selection. Cooked breakfast consisted of two pieces of reheated undercooked bacon and some sloppy scrambled egg - that was it was all they did, served (with a grunt from kitchen staff who clearly resented having customers) while you stood and waited by the kitchen door. Apparently they no longer offer a proper breakfast because they cannot cope since they added their additional rooms at Grand 22 (their explanation when challenged). This is not a four star or whatever it claims to be. Not recommended. 
-2;" Just returned home after a 2 night stay at Brook Marston Farm Hotel and have to say our stay there was very disappointing.   On arrival we were informed that our room had been changed from the one booked, asked when booking for a room overlooking the courtyard, to a corner room over the roof of the restaurant/bar area so the view from our window was now of a roofing felt covered flat roof. We were then informed that, as there was a wedding reception taking place, this room would be better as we shouldnt be disturbed by the event how wrong that was as we were very disturbed by both the music and the DJ up until well after 11:30 and while we accept that these things are noisy when other paying guests are using the hotel surely consideration should also be given to them.  So after the music finally ended we settled down to sleep until woken at 12:30 by a very loud humming noise, so loud we both thought it was the fire alarm, after investigation l discovered it was coming from the water system, it stopped when cold tap was opened and started agian when tap closed, this noise stopped after a cpl more minutes only to restart 15 mins later before finally stopping for the night.  So after a not so peaceful nights rest we went downstairs for breakfast to be greeted by a part self service part canteen hot plate service with one 4 slice toaster between guests for which we had to queue to use with the guests from the wedding party, some 70+ although thankfully only around 30 were in the dinning room with us, resulting in a 20 minutes wait to uxe the toaster adding to that all but the baked beans off the &quot;cooked&quot; breakfast was luke warm at best cold at worst.  After another sleep interrupted night with the water pipes while dressing for breakfast at around 08:15 a cleaner opened our door and was only prevented from walking straight in by the door chain we had put across we heard an voice say &quot;sorry&quot; and the door closed.  So in conclusion if your thinking of staying may we suggest 3 things ..1: check if theres a wedding reception 2: if there is take earplugs although you may still need them due to the water pipe medley during the early hours and finally 3: make sure you use the door chain unless your happy to be dressing when the cleaner comes round unannounced. "
-2; When travelling on business there are 3 things I require, 1 comfortable bed, reliable wifi and a hot shower. Unfortunately the Hilton Olimpia offered me one. On checking in I was told wifi in the room was charged at £14, I don't mind paying for services that offer me value, this I believe is extortionate. I was kindly offered a free wifi code for the lobby, to find that only corner or said lobby had signal coverage and was oversubscribed with users.  In the room the bed was very comfy, and the room finished to a decent standard. I woke in the morning to find the shower was not working, there was however water to the bath so I would guess pressure the issue. At the time in the morning I was leaving there was no engineer on duty, so had to settle for a bath. I checked out and asked to make a complaint, the receptionist said she couldn't handle it and there was no manager available. Had a booked through the hotel my ranking would have been 1 star, the fact I only paid a fraction of the rack rate through Hotwire saved it a star. A late and disgruntled customer.   
-2;Inside the hotel it looks great, walk up the grand staircase with fancy period decor airy and bright, get to the corridor and its getting a bit stuffier, get in to you room and its a sweat box, window opens 2 inches but if its just as warm outside its going to heat the room even more, all the rooms come with a fan in the wardrobe so they are aware of the issue. If you going to charge this sort of money the room must have some form of climate control, no water in the room, no biscuits with the tea, small details but at this sort of price its details that make the difference, parking is available but at £16 a day it just adds to a very expensive trip. I see some comments about the staff, in my opinion the staff are not rude they are just overworked with the large numbers of guests and cannot deal with 3 people at once. Breakfast is of a good standard with fresh cooked eggs available.
-2; Stayed here for a long weekend and was quite disappointed in the hotel room. There is a sign at reception saying if your stay is not a ten then contact the manager - I'd have wasted my 2 day break listing what was wrong if I had done that. A wet smell in the room, which we discovered was due to some damp carpet, a very hard uncomfortable bed, a toilet handle that would only half work.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, but this hotel really needs a refurbishment. For example during a heavy rain storm the conservatory roof started leaking and several people had to move quickly!  Part of the package we booked included a meal in the restaurant on our first night. This turned out to be a buffet, a very disappointing buffet. limited choice what was on offer was unappealing and not very hot. We were delighted to be told that the restaurant was closed the following evening.   The main plus was breakfast a good selection of hot and cold items.   Overall a surprisingly busy hotel with good staff, but certainly in need of an upgrade. 
-2; bathroom was dirty, hairs, ordered room service & salmon was burned and tasted awful. I had to go to bar & pay for meal because they didn't take card payment at room service. Staff were polite & friendly, but I won't be staying again. 
-2; We stayed in this hotel the night before going on holiday and booked 2 weeks parking. We were checked in by a snotty member of staff looking down her nose at us. When finally booked in I asked her how to get to our room, she looked at us like we should know and pointed to the lift.  We booked a suite and the only difference to me is that it included an outdated very old table and chairs with a telephone on it.   The breakfast was terrible, nothing was cooked properly, I wouldnt have give it to my dog. To top it off they tried to charge us although breakfast was included in the price of our stay.  The only reason I am awarding this 2 stars is that the meal we had the night we arrived was very good. The service from the waiter in the restaurant was excellant.  I will not be staying at this hotel again!! 
-2; Been coming here on and off for a while and it's generally a nice pub and the food is quite good - but the service is ridiculously S-L-O-W...... Many times you come in and there is no-one behind the Bar. The hand drier in the gents loo is also a complete joke, it would take 3 hours to dry your hands.... Come on guys!!! 
-2; Arrived late and to be hit with valet parking charge was a total joke stay away a lot will not use rad blu in bristol again Was given a room on first floor overlooking a grubby street. gym was well equipped and open 24 hours  Restaurant staff were lovely food ok 
-2;" As a treat we booked to have Sunday Lunch at The Cavendish. They do not take dogs so we could not stay but we thought lunch would be worth it. Wrong ! The &quot; roast beef&quot; was a slab of over cooked beef and was tough. Roast Beef to me is normally sliced or carved and I thought this was no better than some poor Gastropub. The &quot; roast loin of pork&quot; was also,a slab like piece of meat similar to a large chop with no bone in.  The meat was replaced when we sent it back but my point is at the price they charge one would honestly expect better. Will not be visiting again but if you do , and you wish to have Sunday Lunch and want the roast , do ask for it to be carved if that is how you like it. Might save any stress. "
-2;" I'll enlarge this review slightly when I get a sec, but want to put something in. I paid a little more for a superior room, and I'd recommend that you do not. It advertised a jacuzzi, but I took one look at it and I worried about getting something bad from it, so gave that a miss. The shower, which granted was extremely powerful, did not have a curtain, and you balanced in the minging jacuzzi, so the bathroom was soaking by the time I'd finished. This is probably why the wood in the bathroom was horribly rotten. Enough rotten wood to put you off being in there. Neither was the place particularly clean.  The restaurant was OK. I had a steak though which was &quot;specially selected&quot; probably specially selected from a pound store.  The staff are good, pretty friendly, but I mentioned my disappointment with my dinner, and the room, and they just kind of walked away.  The hotel is in lovely grounds, and the building is lovely.  There's a lot of old people here, and sometimes they don't complain as much, so they can allow standards to slip. Bit of a shame. "
-2; Location and price are why you may book here.  My room on first floor at front of hotel had a small balcony above a hugely busy london street. The door to this was ancient and ill fitting and provided very little sound protection so it was rather like trying to sleep with a window open all night. Horrid.  Room had a strange smell. It might have been rather excessive pungent toilettry/ air freshened , overall made it an unpleasant place.  Wifi was good.  Overall ...avoid. 
-2;" We stayed at the Gatwick Hilton pre and post holiday flights. Very disappointed that the adapted rooms for disabled guests have &quot;shower over bath&quot; rooms, and grab handles/bars in the most unhelpful positions. "
-2;"We appreciate that we had a &quot;deal&quot; BUT that does not excuse the lack of the personal touches one would normally expect of an establishment such as this. No toiletries supplied and whoever made up the bed needs a good few lessons in technique. My wife, Sheila, suffered the most uncomfortable night ever. That said, we had two single beds BUT so far as the room was concerned, it was clear that a double/king bed has been removed and two singles put in its place. Not so bad you might think but the old static headboard serving the larger bed had been left in situ!! The corridors were full of builder's rubble and it was apparent that a makeover of some sort was under way. We did have dinner in the hotel restaurant and this may have been the saving grace for this establishment. Service was excellent and the food was reasonable value for money. OK, portion control may have been obvious to see but that should not detract from the restaurant service staff.  Will we stay at any of this chain of hotels again? Unlikely no matter the deal on offer"
-2; We booked this hotel months in advance as a place to stay whilst attending a weekend event in nearby Overton, The website looks good and the prices suggest a quality hotel. However this is a long way from the truth , yes at first appearance the hotel appears to be nice   BUT there are several negatives that tell a different story. First of all the car parking is a long way from reception , and you have to walk several hundred yards along a winding pathway before you even get into the hotel, (if its after dark then this walk is in the pitch black because there is no lighting along the path) then once you have checked in, there is an equally long walk through the hotel ( some of this is also outside) to get to your room, only to find that the car park is in fact directly outside the room but there is no access to it without walking back past reception.  The reception staff are pleasant enough , they checked us in quite quickly and directed us to our room , there was no offer to show us to the room even though the hotel is a bit of a maze of corridors , however when we eventually found our room , it turned out to be a disabled access room with a wash basin positioned about 18 inches off the floor , I am over 6 feet tall so this was totally unacceptable , so a long walk back to reception to be told that the hotel was fully booked and this was the only room available ( even though I had booked months in advance, they thought it ok to allocate me a bad room) After some discussion they eventually found us another room ( even further away from reception) and this time the girl showed us to the room , which looked ok at first. So we dropped our bags and headed off to get dinner in the restaurant , I won't say too much about the restaurant except to say that both the food and the service were barely acceptable and massively overpriced .  Having returned to the room my other half got into bed whilst I made us a hot drink . I opened the cupboard where the kettle and coffee were stored only to find a big gap where the mini bar should be , a pile of rubbish , mouse droppings and a mouse trap !!  Yet another route march to reception to complain and an offer of a free night , but it was too late to move rooms so we just went to bed - it was a hot night , the windows would not open , there is no air conditioning and the bed was not at all comfortable so we had a pretty poor nights sleep.  Breakfast in the restaurant in the morning was quite simply, awful , two omeletes that took 20 minutes and then turned up burnt and rubbery.  The hotel did move us to another room whilst we were out and this time the room was better , still no air con , but the bed was better and there was a fan , and this time a mini bar instead of a mouse trap , and the windows opened so we did get a slightly better nights sleep   Needless to say the problems had taken the shine off an otherwise good weekend so we cut our stay short and headed home   The Hotel did apologise , they gave us a free bottle of wine and only charged us for one out of the two nights we stayed , but this does not make up for the problems . I would certainly never return and I would not recommend this hotel 
-2; I wonder wether the quality of room was a result of the deal that I got from agoda, as we paid a lot less than the advertised room rate?  Having said that, for £120+ a night, I expected more than a claustrophobic broom cupboard, with barely enough room to walk around the bed, in the basement, with no window, no phone signal or working wifi, and precariously balanced noisy 'mini bar' fridge!! The cupboard (or room rather!) was very clean however, but as for the 'hand made beds.......hmmmmm, handmade in 1000's in a factory more like!! Staff were very friendly & helpful though, but unless the other rooms are significantly different, the star rating & tariff of this hotel needs seriously looking into to! 
-2; i think my expectations were higher than i recieved.. i didnt know what to expect when i booked the hotel. i would love to see what they use to give out the stars.  there was nothing that stood out from my stay in the hotel that i could say my experience was equivalent to being 4 star.. everything was very mediocre.  i think the best thing about the stay was the breakfast but that was cold. oh yes the morning coffee was very nice. first impressions werent very high.. the hotel looks quite modern but when you get inside it isnt.  i asked about WiFi when i first arrived and was told it was only available on the ground floor. most people these days have Ipads/tablets or smart phones which dont have the RJ45 attachment that is in the rooms. also the receptionist never mentioned i needed a password which would allow me to connect to the WiFi.  there was dust mites in the bathroom.. if i told the G/F she would of told me to find a different hotel. the kingsize bed was very uncomfortable and we didnt get a good nights sleep.  there was a christmas party happening on the night we stayed but there didnt seem to be enough staff to accomodate the extra people.  the menu was very limited and the food was not very good for the price i paid. for example. traditional chips.. this must mean frozen because thats what they were. the salad consisted of leaf vegetables..  if you look at the photos on the website.. dont expect them to be in your room.. i was sat with the G/F and she kept asking me what was wrong. i was very disappointed with my stay in the hotel and if you are looking for a 4 star hotel please lower your expectations if you are going to stay here... 
-2; For the price I paid, I expected air conditioning. If I had known there was none I would have stayed elsewhere for less. York has plenty of choice and Hilton must do better. Although the staff were mostly good, the building is clearly tired and facilities lacking. 
-2; Staff were excellent and very helpful and freindly. As already has been stated rooms are very run down. Bathroom we had was only just about fit for use, this was down to existing mould around tiles and bath. Although to be fair it had been cleaned as well as it could. Lovely noisey water feature in the room also noan as an outdated heating system pipes and radiator never shut up all night. I assume the 4 star rating comes from the spa facilities, although it is almost embarrasing to call them that. The most run down outdated pool area you could imagine dark dirty and falling apart. As the other commenter said the lager was cloudy and also unfit for human consumption. Then to add insult to your stay they charge for parking. On the positive Lovely building with lots of character, and breakfast was good. I hope that Puma hotels are going to invest some time and money into this hotel as it has not moved on since my last stay 10 years ago. And with its location and character has great potential to be a great hotel, instead of just saying it is a great hotel. 
-2;It's a shame my review is mostly about a shower which delivered not more than a trickle of water. Not much need for a shower screen as it barely reached it. The temperature was fluctuating to a point that burned you or made you very cold. Only one bath towel supplied and it took four hours to get a borrowed one from the spa. The bathroom mirror light didn't work either.  The room was very tired, but okay for a one night stay. Breakfast was okay and although the staff tried to be attentive, they never quite achieved it. I will not visit again.
-2; Have stayed in many hotels in Manchester and there are much, much better options available for the same or even less money if you shop around. Rooms are tired, dark and in dire need of refurbishment, same applies to the hotel's public areas - however the bar is decent and lively at weekends. Overall, only stay here if you're looking for somewhere out of the norm of Travelodge-type places - but make sure you have a good look round the other options available first! 
-2;"Stayed overnight at the Cheltenham Chase for a Christmas Party night. Although the bedrooms are very good, as a venue for such an event the Chase lacks the 'festive spirit'. Bar Prices are a real 'rip off'. We were charged £7.10 for ONE GLASS of Sauvignon Blanc, and not even a 'good' Sauv either. Food portions were also poor. I don't think I've ever been served such a THIN slice of Pate anywhere else in the world!!! Finally, the dance floor for the event is far too small for the number of people booked in to the party. Several tables were virtually on top of the dance area.  &quot;Captive audience, so let's rip them off&quot; seems to be the festive message at Cheltenham Chase"
-2; Checked in to the room to find towels in the bathroom had been hung up with brown stains on them. When towels were replaced, the stained ones were left behind!  When we went to get into bed, we pulled back the duvet to find brown stains on one side and a crusty white stain the other, along with hairs. We then found fluffy bunny ears in the room. Turns out the room wasn't cleaned from the previous guest!  Hotel staff were apologetic but to be honest the damage is now done and I do not think I will prioritise Doubletree as a brand in the future. 
-2;" So we are checking in and coincidentally are behind the group of ladies in &quot;Nouster's&quot; recent review who were checking out. Well they were not happy and at the time we thought they were making a meal of it. But after staying there for 3 nights we can confirm that the staff are not really cut out for this service thing. We start by being advised that there is no free wi fi. But look we bleated - it says there is in the paperwork. Ah she says. You didnt book direct. If you book direct you get free wi fi. If you go via a third party you dont. But we have a special offer. Upgrade to a larger room, get free wifi and a private lounge and free champagne and drinks every evening between 7 and 9. Seems like a bargain - we thought! So £120 later we go to our room and try the wifi which is useless. We go to the lounge for our free champagne to find its actually Prosecco. When we mention this to the lounge steward he bites our Champagne free heads off. &quot;Dont complain to me - we havent had Champagne here for months. Complain to whoever told you it was Chanpagne on reception&quot; So we did. And their response was &quot;its all the same&quot; &quot; i am not seeing the problem here - so we aid it was Champagne and it is Prosecco - why should you care its free!&quot; Having told her what we think of her interpersonal skills we go to our room which is ok, although the bathroom desperately needs some time, love and money spent on it. My partner doesn't like the pillow so she rings reception for a feather pillow. &quot;Coming right up&quot; is the reassuring reply. But it doesn't. So the next morning we ask again &quot;I'll sort it while youre out&quot; she says. But she doesn't. And on the third day we ask again, explaining our frustration. &quot;Go out&quot; she says &quot;enjoy your day&quot; she says, and when you get back it will be sorted. After a good day out we get to our room and the sofa bed has been pulled out and fully dressed. But still no feather pillows. We phone down and ask about the pillows &quot;There is no point in keeping asking - we dont have any&quot; So we ask why the sofa bed is out &quot;we are too busy to put them out when people ask, so we put them out when you arrive just in case you want them&quot; &quot;But this is our third day - they havent been put out before&quot; If you didn't want it why ask for it&quot; she said. Bizarre. So in summary this is an ok hotel but nothing special, but it has a number of staff who appear just to be there to ruin your day. Take nothing they say on face value, and just because you were told you would get Champagne you may just get Prosecco - and you will be expected to be grateful. There are several hundred hotels in London and there is no reason why you should ever need to use this one. "
-2; I spent the weekend at the Connaught Hotel in Bournemouth, although the main hotel was excellent in decor I was allocated a room in the Lodge (Annex). The general decor was very tired and substandard (in fairness they were having work done in the annex) and not as clean as it should have been.  I had a single room on the 3rd floor and I'm quite a large man, the bathroom was very small, I opened the door and a full size sink takes up most of the space with the WC to the left and shower unit to the right access to both was quite a squeeze to access. The general quality of the bathroom decor was very poor.  The bed wasn't very comfortable and the quilt was too small for the size of the bed, I didn't get a good sleep at all for the two nights I was there.   On the other hand the breakfast was very nice and the staff polite and accommodating.   The hotel has 3 AA star rating, my experience wouldn't have given it one star and if I were in the main hotel I would think the experience would have been quite different, it certainly wasn't worth the money spent.  The experience has put me off going to other Best Western Hotels, this my first stay at the Best Western and I travel quite a lot. 
-2; We ordered room service breakfast at £17 each plus a tray charge of either £3 or £5 - unclear as to which (even if you only want a bowl of cereals, it's £17!!). The earliest possible time to have breakfast is 6.30am, so we opted for this as we had to be leaving at 7.15am, at 6.32am the kitchen phoned our room to say that they had only just received our completed room card request and it would 5 or 10 minutes until they could bring our order. The two breakfast trays were brought to the room at 6.58am. My wife had ordered fruit, porridge and a fruit smoothie. The porridge was a tepid discoloured lump, the fruit was OK and the smoothie was nowhere to be seen. I had ordered a cooked breakfast, fruit, toast and coffee. The cooked breakfast was only just warm, the fried egg yolks had solidified over time. I think the breakfast would have been quite nice had it been delivered as soon as it had been plated. The fruit was OK but the toast never got unwrapped due to us running out of time. Upon checkout, the reception staff were already aware there had been a problem and waived the tray charge of either £3 or £5 each - (still not sure about the £2 discrepancy) and offered us complimentary drink and snack in the bar. We declined the offer as we had to leave but were given vouchers for future use. It would cost us approx. £23 to return to the hotel to take up the offer of 2 coffees and 2 packets of crisps, so we probably won't.  The staff in all cases were very pleasant - no complaint there. However, the clown who misplaced our breakfast order for 6 hours should possibly consider a different industry to practice his ineptitude. The room was too hot during the night with no opening windows and when I put the A/C on it was like having a tractor in the room.  £17 for a bowl of cereals - really? And then add insult to injury with a tray charge!! Overall, not our favourite experience of Media City 
-2; My partner and I lve going to Salcombe, it's a place visit every year for a retreat away from the hustle and bustle of London. This year we decided to go in October for our anniversary rather than the annual regatta.  Our room was an in land view (looking directly onto the street at ground level with no privacy what so ever). Upon arrival we noticed the light in the bathroom was flickering so much it was like going for a shower in a 70's disco. We informed the reception of this on the first day and by the time we left the lightbulb was still not replaced.   On our second night we opted to have dinner at the hotels restaurant. This proved to be a costly mistake. After waiting for an hour and half before any food was brought to the table they still managed to deliver a rather unappetising ribeye steak. It is possible the toughest piece of meat I have come across, the potato wedges were burnt and the vegetables were seriously undercooked. We did complain at the time and the restaurant reduced our bill by a measly 10%. The other meal, quail pie, was good and I would recommend this.  We felt that being a young couple was a distict disadvantage and we were an extremely low priority when staying at the hotel, thankfully we had cancelled our weekend stay and rebooked for a midweek stay otherwise our costs would have been doubled for such a disappointing time.  As we visit Salcombe every year we may give this hotel another try as we were really excited to be staying what appeared on it a well refurbished and elegantly decorated retreat. However the service would have to be significantly improved.   Craig Lawson 
-2;" The first impression of this hotel is splendid. Perfect location, great forecourt. I appreciate that some of the rooms have been redecorated but mine wasn't. The duvet looked like it had seen the last major refurnishing in the 1960s. The internet cable was lying across the floor half way in the middle of the room. The TV appeared to be the most recent item in the room but was most likely about 10 years old already.   I was not convinced by the cleanliness of the room. It appeared that the hotel was generally very clean but that they had last cleaned this room in a bit of a rush. The bed was comfortable but on turning the pillows I found some dark stains, I believe they were fresh but with due care the stained pillow cases would not have been reused. Similarly the internet cable that in most hotels would be in a drawer or neatly folded away, was just lying across the floor.   I do not want to say by any means that this was a dive. Everything was quality made but the 'best before' date of room was long expired. A particular issue where that I had taken some work into the hotel with me and the light was uncomfortably dark and the windows did not shield any noise from the main road...  I had not planned to stay overnight when setting up for my trip to Birmingham and expected to be given complimentary toiletries like shaver, toothpaste, etc on request. To my surprise I was kindly directed towards the &quot;Tesco Express&quot; just outside the hotel. On my return to the hotel, a hotel employee told me in the lift that they used to sell these for a staggering £5.50 from reception. I take that this is the true Scottish Macdonald spirit and i am tempted to conclude that the Macdonald chain is rather cheap than prestigios as I assumed.   The dinner at the hotel was very good and restaurant is well worth a visit. The breakfast was alright (I did pass on the cooked breakfast) and went for a fair selection of continental breakfast.   The service was excellent (and the only reason for rating it down was the utter lack of complimentary toiletries), prompt and very efficient, showing what appeared to be genuine agreement on poor standards regarding the lack of standard complimentary items. "
-2; As a gift for our anniversary we went to RN Hotel for afternoon Tea . The young lady on reception was loverly smily chatty and welcoming. we we're shown through to the Verannda for our Tea , Champagne and a pot of tea and coffee duly arrived very nice .....our food arrived after 40 minutes ... we'd been forgotten  So whilst your waiting chatting drinking tea etc you need the Loo it was awful water/urine on floor a large bin overflowing with used hand towels  [i thought i was at a football stadium not a 4 star hotel] general cleaning had been missed this day We wont go again. 
-2; My RANT! Just find it hard to believe in this day and age I can have Towels, Shampoo, Room service, Tea, Coffee, Shortbread, Soap, Conditioner, Body wash, Shower cap, but only Freeview TV. WHY NO SKY TV. I just hoped to watch Champions League on TV after a hard day on the road. Despite the fact that my employer was paying my bill in full, I decided to decamp to a local Pub, where I ate, drank and watched some football. Is that too much to ask from a 4 star hotel? Some may consider me sad, but quite frankly after a hard day I just want to chill out in a home from home. Surely Hoteliers need to understand basic economics. Retaining customer spend in house is critical. 
-2; After a 5 hour drive to be told by reception staff that we could check in at 11.30 was a relief. We were told to wait in the bar and reception would call the bar to inform us our room was ready. While buying drinks I mentioned this to the barperson, who looked at me as if I was mad. The bar was large, dimly lit and shabby with furniture past its best. The bar staff while pleasant seemed in a dream when serving anyone. Starving - I ordered a match day special of a hot dog with pulled pork and pickled cabbage. It was awful and matched the surroundings. By 14.00 and after a number of trips down to reception to check on our room progress we had had enough. We were offered no apology or explanation just given a cancellation number as if this was an everyday occurrence. Never again!! 
-2;The hotel was fine although the bus to Terminal 5 takes forever. The car parking is a bit of a shambles with cars parked on verges during busy periods. Finally we found that our spare wheel had been stolen from under the car on our return. The price was good but not when you consider the cost of a new wheel. We'll be staying somewhere more secure next time.
-2; Just returned from a night at this hotel , overall very nice , a decent meal in the restaurant in the evening but painfull unattentive service , same in the morning nice breakfast but seemingly clueless staff and not very helpful . A good place for a family room and nice idea with the cookies for the kids with their names on and them having a bunk bed to sleep in as apposed to the usual pull out beds. Over charged for a few items on checkout but quickly resolved , but as I stated above this was down to the staff not having a clue about the pricing of things , did not like the way they down size the wine measurements , yet still manage to charge eight pounds for the wine in question! just blatant profiteering at an already overpriced establishment . The pool is a nice place to end your stay as we did , very unlikely to return here just because of the service , staff and general pretentious atmosphere . 
-2; Whatever you do if you book a stay in this hotel please make sure you have plenty of patience. From the moment you enter the hotel be prepared for a long wait to check-in. Once checked in be prepared for a long wait for a lift, remember this one because from now on you will waiting a long time every-time you use the lift.  The quality of the rooms is not brilliant, cheap irons, toiletries that's like washing up liquid and all rooms noisy if you have one facing the square. Poor quality food at breakfast and long Q's.  Never going to spot there ever again, would not recommend to anyone unless your getting it cheap. 
-2; In fairness, this is a nice clean hotel and is in a lovely location. However our stay was ruined by shockingly overpriced food/drinks, surly - approaching belligerent staff - and an outstandingly long walk to rooms.   On reception we were greeted with a receptionist who seemed annoyed we had appeared. After charging us more than the room cost in case we spent more in the bar (despite the pre-amble telling us we would be charged on check-out) we were told to proceed down a labyrinth of corridors. I should point out, we are talking a serious walk of several 100 metres here, with many twists and turns, but no hint of this was given at reception from the surly woman who checked us in.  Later at the bar, we tried to order drinks from the variously uninterested waiters/waitresses but were rebuffed on multiple occasions without even a hint of care. The wine list was terrible. £25 bought us a 10% proof rose that I would have been disappointed with if I had picked it up from a petrol station for £2.99.  The food (in the bistro) was good but very basic and again very expensive for what was delivered. Again the service was abysmal.   There is a premier in down the road in Middlesbrough with a Toby Carvery attached to it. I suspect you would get better service there for half the cost.  And finally, you can only use their wifi if you agree to them sending you a shed load of spam email. 
-2; Good location and check-in staff very efficient and friendly. Efficient check out too although found it hard to understand the lady. The bedroom was filthy, not been dusted for a couple of months at least, especially under the bed where there were things left from previous guests (not nice). The bathroom door had not been cleaned either and there were splashes all down the glass. Good location though, near to public transport. Won't be staying here again or recommending it to any-one else though. 
-2; Having been here for lunch before we were very disappointed on this occasion .We had booked a table in the conservatory for 1.15 pm, we met in the bar but had to find our way to the table as no staff had brought menus for us to order this was then 1.40.We had to ask for menus and our order to be taken.Although most of the meals where satisfactory ,mine was very poor ,it was a dried out cottage pie,when I asked for a little gravy I was then told they were very sorry but the chef had left so couldn't even choose another meal,but would I like a drink!!! Perhaps it is as well I declined as we had requested water with the meal and that did not turn up at all. Staff did not seem at all bothered and carried on noisily rearranging the chairs and tables for afternoon tea.I was then left to sit with my fellow guests while they had their lunch which did not make a celebratory occasion as enjoyable as it should have been. Although a small discount was reflected in the bill it did not make up for a disappointing lunch. 
-2; Worn out room that has been painted at sometime to a very low standard. Abysmal service in the restaurant on Saturday evening and inedible food. Young and undertrained staff that could not and did not handle complaints. Very expensive and the only reason I can see for this is the location. 
-2; Checked in last night for some quality time with the wife.   On arrival the car park has no signs of Hilton using this as a parking solution. Needed to go inside the hotel to double check this.   However not a big issue just thinking process from hotel going forward.   Me wife checked in and was offered an accessible room which was declined straight away from my wife.   My question is that if you are going to pay for a room that costs £165 a night why would you give this to your customer. Also did not ask if we needed a accessible room ? Just thought that he would give us that ! Really does it look we need a accessible room ? How embarrassing in front other customers and leaving us with such a bad taste in our mouth !   Further to this when we entered our room after feeling very perplexed from out reception, I felt the room was fine at a first look. However saw a note which apologies for the standard of the wash basin as it had marks around the sink, the note said that the sink is clean however the marks from a substance that has reacted and made marks. Again my question to you is that would you expect those marks on a £165 night room ? Regardless of the note or not it's fair to say that a hotel of your standard these cosmetic finishing should be addressed quickly and also take the room out of actions until the problem is fixed. I believe that standards are set by leaders and everyone else follows which in this case there are no standards.   The following morning I decided to use the shower and find that the thermostat tap is broken and comes off and the water is set to luke warm water, how embarrassing that the tap just comes off in your hands, next was the shower head which seemed to drop down and did not stand up ! That's not all the water pressure was just pointless. My car windscreen jet washers were more powerful than the water from this shower head, and not forgetting the tap on wash basin which felt that it was about to fall off too.   Also great charge for the car park which cost me £15 a night ! Do You and your car park partners think you are in Mayfair ! A complete rip off in my opinion and being a business traveler I have stayed in some amazing hotels, such like banyan tree and Mayfair, Hyatt which you guys could never step to the mark.   However that's not the point and the point is that I payed £165 + rip off car park to stay in a hotel which the hotel felt that I needed a disable room and my bathroom is only for show and you can't take a shower because the bathroom would fall apart ! You should be embarrassed Hilton !     I am pretty sure that I will get a standard reply as always ! Please check my trip advisor locations hilton as you will see the places I have stayed before you send me your reply!    
-2; I stay about 40 nights a year at Marriotts and this was definitely the worst so far. The Executive room was in a poor location and at 9.45 pm when I got to it there were at least 8 dirty glasses outside.....yet cleaning had only just been done. It was a dismal room on the lower floor at the back and I decided straight away that I was not happy there. I was told there was little else to offer except a Smoking Suite (I thought all Rooms were now non smoking). I eventually was offered a regular room. I asked for compensation and without hesitation the front desk clerk refused but offered me a free breakfast. I pointed out this was ALREADY part of my package. That was all she was prepared to do.  I asked for the Manager and he reluctantly offered me a 50% discount off a dinner. Frankly I was disappointed at this offer but was too tired to argue further.  This is one Marriott I will not return to. 
-2;"My stay was fine but only because I had a 75% discount, had I paid £600 a night I would have been furious.  - The double bed was two singles zipped together so that it was not comfortable to sleep in the middle.  - There are two restaurants, the nice terrace overlooking the lake and a cafe that looks like an 80's nightmare. The terrace understandably books up fast for dinner, don't get stuck in the cafe, book early.  - The spa felt very low quality for the price. There is a nice large pool with a &quot;whirlpool&quot; to one side, this is essentially a poor quality jacuzzi. There is no other jacuzzi available unless you pay £20 pp for 30 minutes in the Thalosso therapy pool.  - The sauna and steam rooms are in the male and female changing rooms, so not great for couples. However there is a third sauna by the main pool.  - The lockers in the changing rooms have electronic codes but they caused lots of people problems during my stay with the codes not working properly.  For the money they're charging it just is not worth it. I had other friends thinking of going and I have told them not to bother.  It was a cheap hotel for me on a journey home and was fine.  As an expensive spa, it is in desperate need of an update."
-2;The first thing is the website makes out its close to the terminals but it is a £14 taxi ride away. When I arrived, the receptionist rudely demanded my passport and when I asked why she said it was Sheraton policy as if that was a good reason. I specifically asked for a quiet room away from any lifts or stairs - when I got to my room (the long way as she directed me the wrong way) it was next door to a lift! Also, the TV didn't work properly. I went to the Sports Bar and had an overcooked and inedible (burnt almost black) cheeseburger and diet coke for £15. Overnight, my room was very noisy and the walls were surprisingly thin as I could hear conversations from next door. When I checked out they added £1 to my bill for charity without asking - I don't mind giving to charity but not to make Sheraton look generous at other peoples expense. I asked how to get to terminal 3 and was directed to get on a Hotel Hoppa bus outside - it cost £4.50 but would only have been £4 if receptionist had sold me ticket. Finally, I've just realised that the express checkout receipt pushed under my door is not a VAT receipt so I'll have to waste time contacting them again. Overall, not an experience I will repeat.
-2;On the plus side, the staff are friendly, the hotel has a gym (which I was unable to find any mention of on its website) and the restaurant is entirely reasonable. But the annoyance of Marriott's prehistoric policy of charging for a basic utility was compounded by some rather shabby cost-cutting measures.  The quality of the double glazing in the wing where I stayed was very cheap, so my room was naturally cold. The staff (who were generally helpful) brought an additional heater, but were unable to tell me any way of managing the temperature control system. Set it to a temperature and the heating takes it up to that level - and then promptly shuts off! Getting up in the night to put it back on is not the most enjoyable of experiences - particularly when there is snow on the ground outside.
-2; Stayed in the hotel for one night on the ground floor. Surprised to smell stale smoke in the corridors while the rooms had no smoking signs. Corridors give a grimey feel. Room was ok although it has seen better times, the window didn't shut properly, you can hear the busy road and the trouser press didn't work or have the iron attached, the lights were dim, the bath handle is rusting.   Went for breakfast. First three glasses for the fruit juice were filthy, I could feel a coating of food on the outside of the glasses, so stacked them up and tried to bring attention to this....failed. Finally found a clean one to use. The coffee cup on the table was not clean, again covered in brown stains. The table cloth covering the area where the hot food was was covered in yellow stains. The first two plates in the hot plate storage had dried food stains on them. The bread has no tongs so customers hands were touching all the bread. The cold display was dirty, the glass looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a long time.   The Group Finance Director was visiting the hotel, he announced his arrival in reception. So was expecting a polished checkout experience, this wasn't the case. I wasn't greeted, asked about the stay or thanked for the custom. Slow and poor service at the desk. Was genuinely surprised to see the food hygiene rating and the AA review on the wall. So even with a member of senior management the service was poor, which says a lot about the attitude towards mediocrity at the hotel. 
-2; Unfortunately, the quality of the room was disappointing. The toilet seat was broken, the door of the shower was broken as well and didn't close, the bathroom floor was lose and the TV stopped working occasionally... 
-2; My wife and I came for dinner as part of her work Christmas dinner. It’s funny that most of the negative reviews I’ve ever written have been about restaurants and hotels at Christmas. Well The Rougemont is certainly no exception.   The Christmas dinner was truly a work of culinary assassination. The whole meal reminded me of the worst of school dinners. I think this was probably the result of overloading the kitchens with far too many covers, as I can’t believe that a 4 star hotel could produce food of this low quality the rest of the time.  I thought the night could still be salvaged by being able to dance with my lovely wife, however this was another let down. The dance floor was absolutely miniscule, around 12’ x 12’ with the dozens of people cramped in shuffling around. Absolutely amazing planning and absolutely perfect for the hundreds they’d cramped into the room.  I also wonder just how long ago they got their rating. When I worked in the security industry (many years ago), the first thing I would do is to assess what an establishment is really like by checking the quality of the gents toilets. Well on that basis, The Rougemont would have rung alarm bells. Cracked tiles everywhere and very dirty. My wife said this is not the same for the ladies, so really shows that the owners just don't care.   Verdict: Very disappointing that this hotel has become run down, with poor business practices. Sadly like many places today, they would sooner turn a quick profit rather than delight their customers and rely on repeat business. I wouldn’t stay here and neither would I return to eat as it is. 
-2; Stayed on 14 February with relatives to see Phoenix Nights. Paid £116.00 for a supposedly 4 star room. The room was clean but no where near 4 star. The rooms are tired and in desperate need of redecoration. The bathroom tiling reminded me of the underground in London. The thing that spoilt our stay the most was the breakfast chaos the next morning. Arrived at 1000 and had to wait for the bingo call for a table. There were loads of tables free it's just none were cleared. There was hardly any cooked food as a chef didn't turn up and when there was food there was no one to serve it. Some poor chef was doing both the cooking in the kitchen and was then having to cook eggs etc at the servers. Utter chaos and after being seated for 20 minutes with no coffee etc we gave up. Really sorry Copthorne but it's not good enough. Understaffed, under trained and as a customer very underwhelmed. Won't be staying again. 
-2; We booked this room for our wedding for prep for bride and for Bride and Groom in the evening.   Bride requested for the room to be cleaned before we arrived later in the evening - this was not done, which in turn ruined our night after our wedding!   I ordered a surprise on the day and I expected a chocolate cake with a message on top and what turned up was a plate with a message and tiny slices of cake around it - I would have paid nearly £17 for that!   Also, the lift was not working so we had to walk around the hotel to the nearest lift without any help!     So in all for what was meant to be a special experience didn't turn out to be the case! 
-2; Booked for a night away, helpful staff but a really disappointing room and experience overall.   Compared to a premier inn or travel lodge even the 'desirable room' was small, bathroom cramped and room extremely noisy. The pub outside the window combined with the TV from the room next door made sleep difficult. The worst nights sleep I've had in a hotel.  Great location but this hotel does not give value for money and I would not stay here or in another aBode again. 
-2;" Busy morning in Redmonds restaurant staff working flat out as always I'm sure some have been in very early to accomadate as 10 o'clock approach s arrives late with her husband and asks the waitress in a demanding manner where's the food one buffet had been moved across to other side which I had watched been done the waitress showed her the other buffet still had food. The woman shouted aggressively at the waitress in front of the whole restaurant &quot;you should put a smile on your face and say good morning and give me some respect &quot; and walked off I was horrified at the woman . These waitress 's work damm hard to be spoken to like that . The woman should have been ask to leave the restaurant .The managers should protect there staff more and act accordingly 03/01/14 "
-2;Stayed here recently with friends, and it was fairly disappointing. It's all just a bit sad in that English hotel way. Looks great on the outside, but quality of rooms is quite low. One of our rooms was very hot - when we enquired the staff said it was next to the boiler room - other people had said the same - but made no offer of moving to a new room (or indeed fixing the problem). Hot water pressure in both rooms was so low as to make the shower impossible to use. The wifi didn't work our first day there, despite the reception staff insisting it did.  Bar, restaurant and spa staff were all very friendly, but the management needs to invest a bit more.
-2; all style and no comfort : cold day no heating in common areas::only one chair in superior bedroom: cheapest toilet paper: sandwich with no salad :fifteen minutes to bring car at a quiet time :very poor value 
-2; My wife and I had a recent stay and I think the chalets need a total overhaul and the food menu also needs looking at, we found the vegetables were over cooked and had very little taste. The restaurant was very cramped and we learned later they had put an extra 40 small tables in there. 
-2; Great location fab staff disappointed in the rooms, great staff friendly helpful and happy. Rooms are small over priced outdated not enough milk to have a second coffee and need a blood good clean. Go to the nearest primer inn you will get a better nights sleep. Not worth taking a pic to add. 
-2; I haven't written a review for such a long time...but had to come out of hibernation to tell you about this. Have you heard the phrase...always turn a negative into a positive? I don't think the Ramada in Coventry has... With my partner and 11 year old nephew, we booked the tower that is the Ramada Hotel in Coventry and requested a high floor. I always like a high floor not only for views, but also to give the child a potted history of the city we're visiting, pointing to various landmarks from above. The room we were given was on the 2nd floor (out of 16) and had 2 windows. One window was COMPLETELY blocked by a metal wall covering the adjoining car park, and the other window, from the bed, was partly obscured and the remainder filled with the joys of tatty shops and an abandoned open car park. Oh the glamour. This was depressing and horrible. The receptionist tried to suggest that room 202 was a bigger room to accommodate the extra child bed (which cost an extra £15 thank you very much). How they think we experienced travellers are so thick...so what about room 602 or 402 or 502 or 1402 etc etc? I understand that the new(ish) car park could obscure a couple of rooms in their hotel...so turn that negative into a positive. What I would have done is to remove the window fully blocked by the wall and replace it with a lovely stained glass opaque window instead - turn an eyesore into a feature. You see, people like me would never go there again...ever...but if it had that kind of feature...well it might be something to big-up in reviews like this. Oh Ramada...ye of little faith in your customers. This was a joyless visit impeded by the bland room with its awful view. 
-2;" The room (301) was excellent, very large with two double beds and a decent sized bath room. Sadly, it was near both the stairs and a link bridge to the bar so it was somewhat noisy, but not really a lot to be done about that.  The location is good, and the car park has plenty of space. The breakfast was acceptable however the service wasn't.  Day one breakfast, walked in and headed over to a waitress and asked   Where I could sit please (note didn't get offer to be seated) She politely answered anywhere. Sat down and was told &quot;No, not there - on this side of the room.&quot; Fair enough I suppose..  Next asked for coffee (note didn't get offered any) was told she would go and get it Helped myself to the buffet breakfast - very reasonable Got myself some orange juice. Still waiting for coffee after 15 minutes Gave up and went to a Costa on the way into work.   Day two breakfast, walked in and headed over to a waitress at the reception desk. Got moaned at because my room wasn't listed on the sheet and she had to write it in.  Asked for coffee and this arrived in time for breakfast yay! Asked for toast as couldn't see a toaster and it arrived just after I finished the breakfast. Note, wasn't offered either.  Went to check out and noticed they hadn't included the day two breakfast on the bill so I mentioned it and asked for it to be put on, which is was but not with the good grace of the fact I was being honest.  To top it all, the bill was just plain confusing!  In summary, I don't tend to complain and take things at face value (check out any of my other TA reviews) but I won't be going back to the White House.   The hotel and food were perfectly fine, as was the location and the facilities (I didn't use) seemed good but it's all in the service for me and this was sadly lacking. One day poor service is fine as everyone has an off day, but being made to feel unwelcome for two days is off putting and I'll use other hotels in the area rather than go back.  Sadly, not recommended "
-2; Hello,   Stayed here for a few days to attend a nearby wedding. The venue is stated as four star. However it requires an update. The reception area especially!   Four star, one expects a robe, slippers..etc   However the in room breakfast service was very good! Food arrived on time and hot.   Rooms vary greatly, overall 3 star is more accurate!    
-2; my wife and i booked this hotel through hotwire when we saw what hotel we we staying in we thought yes thats a good one . NOT. check in was fine came down to the main bar about 3.20pm waited,waited, waited still no one to serve us .i asked a girl who was stood a her waitress station is there any one serving, she kindley said i will help you, i asked for a beer and an archers and lemonade she served us no archers in my wifes drink and a bill with an added 75p service charge.  later in the evening we decided to have a meal in the room.before that i went to the foyer to get some water,they have a costa coffee there.waiting again at the takeaway part no one was there so i looked around the corner to see the waiters talking i ask for some water he replied sorry i cannot serve here and can i go to the bar.furious i stormed off back to the room told my wife then rang for room service to order some food,i told them the situation with the water,they said that i should have been served with the water.After this i went to see the duty manager who kindly got me some water. our food was excellent. room was tired cracked sink and grimned bath. Nb before are travel we were going to use the swiming pool decided not to because you can be seen by everyone through glass partitions, not everybodys cup of tea being in a gold fish bowl. 
-2;" We were charged £140 room only for the night. I think this was pricey for the standard of room offered. The air conditioning did not work well, decor and also the bathroom was &quot;tired&quot; and the shower pressure was weak. They also allow guests to bring dogs, and in our room there was definitely a strong smell of dog. So overall £140 for a hot night in a kennel. OK if that's your thing !. "
-2; Having just got back from an overnight spa trip at the hotel there is no doubt that the decor especially in the bedrooms is excellent. As a 5 star hotel, everything needs to be excellent and where the hotel fails is in the restaurant. Problems with the accuracy is bad, side dishes arriving 10 minutes after your main is worse but finding a spider in your mint tea is an absolute disgrace. Add that to the manageress laughing when you tell her and what should have been a lovely night away becomes a real dissapointment. The next morning I hoped things would improve but mould on berries at breakfast was the final straw. 
-2; We have stayed at Hotel Felix before and liked the combination of boutique hotel, relaxed atmosphere and well appointed rooms. We stayed this year for our daughter's graduation and unfortunately had a much less enjoyable time. We had booked two rooms early in the year and as the weekend approached, attempts were made to downgrade our rooms, presumably to resell them with the realisation that it would be a busy weekend.  However our main complaint revolved around the rather lackadaisical approach of many but not all the staff, particularly in the restaurant. A number of the staff failed pretty badly on the personal hygiene front. For a relatively expensive hotel, the service was quite chaotic and unpleasant to the extent that one just wanted to leave early. Disappointing, given Hotel Felix's previous performance- overall, a fail on this occasion.  
-2; Given the price we paid (£109 for one night) I was expecting more. My first impression on arrival, given the sole, apparently poorly maintained lift (half the lights on the buttons didn't work) wasn't a good start, and the room didn't improve my opinion. The bathroom was in a bad state of repair: cracks in the sink, a large piece of enamel missing from the rusty bath, and cracked and dirty grout in the tiles. The furniture in the room didn't match, and the upholstery was dingy and stained. My wife found the bed extremely uncomfortable, and my feeling of poor value for money was only reinforced by the take-away Costa coffees being nearly double the normal high-street price. 
-2; We booked the New Years Eve package and were completely disappointed with our experience. In previous years we had stayed at The Plumber Manor and Ston Easton Park for New Years Eve and had an excellent time at both. Not so at Bowood and our review reflects comments on the hotel in your reviews and those entered in their guest book on January 1st. In summary: - we had lunch in the brasserie and soup and sandwiches took around 40 minutes to be served. No apologies for the delay. The bill arrived in 1 minute! - there was a mix up with our suite. We expected to be on the 1st floor. - we were not told on booking that the function was being held in a separate building and having to walk there and back in the damp weather was disappointing in the extreme. At one stage during the afternoon we were told by reception that cars would be available to take us from the hotel to the function. - we were on captains tables and this was not explained when we made the booking or in subsequent correspondence. - the food was mass catering standard and not a four star hotel experience. - breakfast was one star standard at best. - the suite was nicely furnished with a good bathroom. - the service in the hotel lounge for afternoon tea was very good. We have written to the hotel and the above problems were acknowledged and an offer made to visit for a free dinner. Given our experience we have declined. 
-2; TV didn't work, couldn't get anyone at Reception to answer the phone, run down, in need of some TLC. Very noisy room, not the normal standard delivered by Hilton. Parking overnight £8, seems excessive, very close to long term parking that would be much less expensive. 
-2; We booked this hotel via Secret Escapes wanting a weekend break in a traditional 4/5 star hotel with Quality Spa and treatment facilities. Before we arrived we tried to prebook treatments.Took 30minutes to answer the phone then had to ring back with a deposit-took 45 minutes to answer the phone .By the end of the weekend we realised that staff must be trained to just hang up rather than deal with customer requests/queries.  On first impression the Hall looks grand and the grounds very impressive but as soon as you step through the door impressions change. Our room 707 ,a deluxe ,required 2 lifts to get to a it and a route march through a myriad of corridors. It soon became apparent that behind the Hotel Grand facade was a modern conference venue -well modern in the 80s as I doubt any of it has seen a lick of paint since. So the bedrooms are typical conference bland ,no character ,poor quality bed ,newly fitted bathroom but tiny. We ventured to the bar for a pre dinner drink -resembles a working mans club ,sport tv ,dirty tables not cleared very small with an overfil corridor for guests to sit and have a drink. Dinner was about what you would expect in a 3 star hotel feeding a lot of guests. Staff were helpful,starter miniscule ,steak main course required a £9 supplement and they charged us £3.50 extra each for a cup of processed coffee. Breakfast ,very poor ,tinned fruit ,pre cooked eggs ,bacon ,sausages, uninterested staff . The advertising by Secret Escapes did not say anything about it been a coach party destination plus a wedding -average age of the coach party 75 plus. We decided to spend the Holiday monday relaxing in the Spa followed by a massage. changing rooms very tired,and dirty ,lounge area equally so . Went to the pool area to find it occupied by an over 75 aqua class dancing in the water to chubby checker et al. At this point I lost the will to live,cancelled the massage ,checked out and ESCAPED-NO SECRET. The cost for this delightful one nighter vis Secret Escapes a real bargain at £170 for the 2 of us..  Is it the Hotels fault ,maybe if they purport to be 4.5 star ,this was 3star and if its 3 star you want and think the price ok then go ahead ,treat yourself !  Our real disappointment is with SECRET ESCAPES who have knowingly mislead us and bith ruined and wasted our weekend to which I would say-BUYER BEWARE, 
-2; I have stayed here on a few occasions when flying into and out of Stansted. Always been enjoyable, but tonight, well, food was just shocking. Could not get into the steak restaurant for love nor money, so ate it fellini. Used to be very good with fresh pasta, fish and always worth the extra you pay at airport hotels. Tonight an English menu, very limited and quality of food AWFUL. Mass produced goats cheese tart and boil in the bag lamb. tough and tasteless. Would have enjoyed a burger king at the airport more! Time to find another hotel to use unless the management here can seriously get their F and B to a decent sta dark again. Very very disgusted. 
-2; From the outside, and from the pictures on the website this hotel is absolutely exquisite! But it's all a facade. I had the misfortune of staying at St. Ermins and was stuck in what I can only describe as a beautifully decorated cell! Having to listen to the drone of an engine room for the entire night. To add insult to injury - don't expect to see daylight or the outside world if you stay here - as it's in such a built up are, all windows are blocked out by thick linen blinds making the rooms dark and dingy and needing the lights on all the time - very, very claustrophobic. Outside, beautiful, lobby, beautiful, interior design beautiful - rooms, small, claustrophobic, dark, noisy - a bloody awful nights sleep - I wouldn't rush back - stay at the Intercontinental across the road!!! 
-2; We last stayed in the Holiday Inn Plymouth in 2004 and had stayed there previously for the Class 1 World Offshore Championships together with some of the teams.  The hotel remains as it was, completely unchanged.  We had upgraded our room but it was disappointing. It was roomy but old and the bed was quite soft. We had room 402 which was next to the lift and so had lift noise which was a shame.  The breakfast is quite nice on the PH floor which has amazing views over the Hoe, but unfortunately the seal has gone in some of the windows and so where we were sitting we could only see a misted up window.  The garage is very tight with very small parking spaces. We had a small Mercedes but it was very difficult to park in the small spaces.  A great location but needs a lot of work, 
-2;" Obviously some of the previous reviewers are easily pleased. My experience with my colleagues: 1. I found myself in a 'cloaking device' at the bar. After 10 minutes of being ignored I had to go to reception [Hotel Manager: the bar needs to be fully staffed 5pm - 12pm and please ensure staffs are trained and attentive] 2. WiFi ineffective and TV about 7-8 channels only [Hotel Manager: bring your hotel into the 21st Century] 3. Tried to order a bar meal but found oneself in the wretched cloaking device again. Ignored for about 20-30 minutes this time 4. No gym at hotel - not good for a large 4* (sic) hotel 5. Had a leisurely breakfast - but only because they take so long to bring the coffee. I had to ask if it was lost in transit. 6. Never seemed to be any fried eggs at breakfast – usually ran out and then you had to wait for new ones to be brought out 7. All the wrong utensils were put out for breakfast - so you tried to serve yourself mushrooms with tongs instead of a serving spoon. 8. When I complained was told all the other guests thought all was good! Oh well so that's all right then.  On the plus point the location, parking and rooms are fine. The food is generally ok and the hotel is comfortable. I just wish they would sort out the service.  The positive reviews here amaze me; I must have stayed in a different hotel! I would stay again, but it's got to improve - at the moment I'm travelling on business - I certainly would not be paying the full bill if it was my own money. "
-2;Package included a meal on the first night but restaurant fully booked and could not eat until 9.30pm. Leisure facility very busy and cleanliness needs attention. Even with the package deal hotel felt over priced and not good value. Did not get the weekend experience I expected.
-2;" We visited The Sandhurst restaurant as a group of 6 for a friends birthday party. I'm already a huge fan of a restaurant in Middlewich so was disappointed not to be visiting their instead but open minded about this visit as assumed it would be something special and memorable with the unusual Edwardian theme. We arrived to find a damp 'Nana's house' type smell and one of two draft lager pumps not working so chose the Bitburger over the unavailable Carling. We then entered the restaurant to find it empty other than a table for 3 people who appeared happy to see other people dining. We ordered and service by the waitress was excellent other than a little slow regarding drink orders, but I feel this is more due to the fact she appeared to the only one on duty having to visit the kitchen, the restaurant and a the bar in a different room. Starters, deserts and coffee were all very nice, but we were very disappointed with the mains! They come as a sharing platter/board and thankfully instead of sharing with my wife, I shared with a friend while my wife shared with his wife. I say thankfully as we chose the chicken which came as 2 chicken breasts and a big chicken leg/thigh, only for me and my friend to eat the breasts and then decide against the thigh as, after picking it up off the board and see blood, we turned the piece over only to find lots of raw, uncooked chicken with oozing blood - considering both our wives are pregnant we immediately were please that we'd eaten the previous pieces of chicken instead!!!  We decided not to make a scene but would at the very least say something which we did to find a very apologetic response from the waitress who was very lovely, but were very surprised after she took it back to the kitchen that we received no apology from the chef or any manager of any sort. Considering at this point we were the only people in the otherwise empty restaurant we came quickly to the conclusion that the chef either didn't care or maybe didn't want us to see him in his Edwardian outfit! The waitress was told she could offer a free drink as compensation... This stunned us considering the serious nature of raw chicken and lack of apology and surprised we weren't asked if we even wanted a replacement piece of chicken as, after all, this was a big part of our meal for 2 people and the sharing bowl of potatoes and veg was itself already limited in portion size. Still, there would be a small piece of birthday cake for everyone to share -if- any cake had been brought out which it wasn't. Even an Edwardian &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; song might have brought some smiles back to our table but alas this didn't happen either even though they knew we were there as birthday party as &quot;birthday girl&quot; had been mentioned by the waitress already.  To be honest this whole Edwardian theme just wasn't my thing and not quite sure who if anyone (judging by the empty restaurant) finds that it is there thing so I applaud the fact that they are trying to use Groupon to gain some new clientele, but definitely think that the service and food needs serious revision and improvement if I was to ever be interested in returning again. The lack of professional apology for serving raw chicken however and a replacement drink to resolve will no doubt prevent me from doing so though... "
-2;" Firstly, I should come clean and say that I was already aware Butlins is not really my kind of place, but when the stag insists this is where he wants to, well, stag... you just deal with it as best you can. I figured alcohol would see me though the ordeal.   My twin bedded room was clean enough, although it did smell faintly of what I imagine nursing home store cupboards would smell of. This was no big deal, as I didn't anticipate spending much time in the room anyway, especially after discovering that the TV had no signal and I wouldn't be able to watch the 6 nations games from the comfort of my bed. Until this weekend, I didn't realise there was actually a size beneath &quot;single&quot; beds. I'm sure they're fine if you're a coffin sleeper, but not if you're a starfish. I'm the latter so found it difficult to keep all limbs aboard.  Initially I thought £90 was a reasonable price for 3 nights stay plus the so-called entertainment. The lack of room facilities though, made it feel more like a youth hostel. Two complimentary tea-bags for 3 days, but it was OK because once these were used you could buy more from the SPAR shop. Which from what I can gather is an acronym of Stupendously Pricey And Rubbish. I wasn't happy that bathroom towels had to be hired. I'd considered using the curtains, but didn't want to expose myself to any passing foot traffic but it later turned out that this is a pretty standard practice in Butlins and a walk through the apartment blocks at 7'ish is a voyeur's paradise. Especially if partially dressed superheroes, mexicans & wookies are your thing. Anyway, I left the curtains alone - it would've been hard enough explain to my girlfriend that my new STD was most likely a result of a towelling with the room furnishings and not a typical stag/hen encounter.  I found the entertainment quality to be directly proportional to my alcohol consumption. It was actually pretty good after 6 jager bombs & 8 pints. I spent much of the eighties at school and playing rubbish computer games so I didn't fully appreciate just how awful the music of that era was. I do now.  The food available seemed to be mostly processed crap. The Burger King prices were higher than most motorway service prices and service is slooooooow. I couldn't bring myself to pay £11 for breakfast, so I went shopping in SPAR. Now, I'm not sure if Harrods sell Doritos, but I think if they did they'd definitely be cheaper than they were at the SPAR. I didn't just have Doritos for breakfast, I picked up some dip too. You don't have Weetabix without milk, right!? It wasn't all bad; the Fish n Chip shop is very good. In fact, fish 'n chips at midnight was I think the highlight of my weekend. It's up there with seeing a dance-off between Batman, a Storm Trooper and Hulk Hogan. Hulk Hogan, in case you were wondering who won.  I'm not sure I'll ever be back to Butlins. I had genuinely hoped to have my preconceptions squashed but unfortunately they weren't. If you're an extroverted alcoholic that likes rubbish music, bland food and making a tit of yourself, you'll love it. Dress like a Mexican and you'll be able to choose from endless Stag parties to join. "
-2;"Not sure that i could have stayed at the same hotel as other recent reviewers, although most of the staff were very helpful and charming it was usally to apologies for the general state of some of the facilities, the &quot;free Wifi&quot; had a very poor signal in the room, the meeting room had a table that wobbled over 6&quot; either way, all the outside furniture had had a coat of varnish even though most of it was broken, the bar closed at 10.30-11pm with no option for night porter service and the leisure facilities were closed till further notice? On the positive side rooms clean and tidy and the breakfast was decent"
-2;" For work I require the internet so i only book hotels with free wireless internet access in the rooms which is why I plumped for the Brook Mollington as below is the listing on the Hotels.com website:  Room details: 1 double Flat-panel television. Complimentary wireless Internet access. Ensuite bathroom. Bath amenities include hair dryer and complimentary toiletries. Iron/ironing board and trouser press. Non-Smoking.  It clearly states complimentary wirelsess Internet access. So to my surprise I was informed by the lady on reception that they don't have free wireless in the rooms but &quot;it's only £4&quot;. That's not the point. It's listed as a room detail that they have complimentary wirless internet. In fact it was even in bold text! She apologised and said that it was a mistake by Hotels.com and that her manager was sorting it out immediately. So to my suprise - 6 days later - I check Hotels.com and it's still listed on there.   Now, this hotel isn't too bad. As the reviewer below said it's a bit tired and shabby but on the whole it's ok. The heating is out of date and makes more noise than heat - in room 62 anyway - the window was cracked and the car park is ill lit but they're only minor faults. What I don't like though is being lied too. I'm fairly confident the listings on these 3rd party websites are done by the hotels. So to fob me off with 'it's their fault' excuse and to then not actually change the listing is a little insulting. Internet might only be £4 but that's not the point. Avoid if you can. "
-2;" We've stayed here a few times and it gets worse on each occasion. Although this will be the last. The &quot;friendly and attentive&quot; staff mentioned in some reviews are obviously all on holiday this week and instead we appear to have a group of people on some kind of Jobseekers scheme. At these prices I expect staff to know where the rooms are and ideally take my bag there for me - especially when you can't reach it by the lift! It would also have been nice if they had either of our names right on the booking. Mine wasn't even there despite three separate confirmation emails.  Breakfast was below average - the last time I saw that much processed food in one place was Tesco. The room was a good size, but stinking hot and we seem to be above a wedding party, which is why I am writing this now instead of sleeping.  The carpets are dirty and threadbare, the one in our room looks like waves on a surfer beach, several of those in the public areas are held together with gaffer tape.  So the building looks pretty. Well, actually only the front. The extension at the back looks like a 1960s nuclear bunker. But a pretty building is not worth this price tag unless it is well looked after and staffed by people who have some sense of customer service.  Shoddy. Shabby. Absolutely not worth the extortionate price. Never again. "
-2; I'm quite happy to share my disappointment with my visit to the Hilton Hotel Heathrow Imagine Spa at being a regular at spas both in London and abroad and feel this will be my first and last time using an amazon type voucher for such an experience. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member, I was saddened that Hilton allow such basic qualities for its spa concession.   Let me start by saying that a visit to a spa at a deluxe hotel should feel like an indulgent luxury to the guest. Spa areas should feel welcoming and intimate.   What I found from our visit was the following:-  The staff weren't attentive and had to be called from a back office to greet us at the reception desk whereupon the tone of the receptionist was very impersonal and gave an initial bad impression. They were too busy 'gossiping' in the back room.   The lockers in the changing room were all full bar a broken locker which we hoped would be safe for our belongings.   The air temperature around the small pool was cool or if anything cold, as was the temperature in the pool.   The furniture upstairs in the relaxation lounge felt very basic and of the quality that I'd expect if I was to shop in Ikea with an awful plastic feel. I appreciate that some guests will be wet or damp visiting the lounge but decent furniture possibly covered with washable towels would be more appropriate.   The deep tissue massage was bizarre as was the background music to the point that I needed a recovery massage at the newly opened Akasha Spa at the Cafe Royal the following day.   We originally planned to have a secondary additional treatment later in the afternoon but judging from the first treatment, we cancelled the second, dressed and left the spa to go elsewhere.   Normally I'd suggest there was style over substance but sadly, this place had neither. 
-2; The hotel is clean and modern but some bad management decisions make it a PR disaster. The first problem is that it is expensive, a king bed with a river view costs £295.00 per night. Our room was well fitted out but small with limited room to unpack and a cramped bathroom, very disappointing for the price. On arrival we were told that leaving our car in the car park would cost an additional £18.00 for 24 hours. When I queried this, I was told I should be grateful because the standard car park rate is £2.00 per hour so we should expect to pay £48.00. When we asked about internet access I was told that a single device would cost an additional £7.00 for 24 hours or we could pay for 3 devices which would cost £15.00! The final insult was a £1.00 donation to the Hilton Foundation which was added to our bill without our consent. This small minded profiteering combined with apathetic staff left us feeling plundered by the large Hilton corporation, needless to say we wont be rushing back to repeat our experience at the Doubletree. 
-2;"Plus Points, customer service by the restaurant and hotel staff is good. Rooms are modern and spacious and the location is great. Bad Points. prices are very high, food would be average at half what they charge I don't expect to return meals at those sort prices [and I am not a picky eater] I went to a wedding there and was made to feel &quot; well if you don't like it go somewhere else we are not bothered' for the life of me I can't see why the reviews are so good"
-2; First of all I must say that the breakfast is great, the public areas are impressive and there are large TV in the rooms.  Unfortunately the rooms are not to the same standard. We stayed in May 2010. Between us we had 4 rooms booked. We had got a special deal so did not expect to get top quality rooms, but hoped we would!  The one on the 6th floor overlooking the sea looked like it was recently renovated. The one on the 4th floor was a single, and in a reasonable condition. One of the rooms on the 2nd floor was a good size with a large bed and also looked like it had had some recent attention.  That leaves our room, which was on the second floor. Needed to make a call straight away and get someone to turn off one of the radiators - the other one was off - but there was no way to adjust it yourself. The hair dryer also had to be replaced. What we missed was the fact that there was no cold water - only hot and warm. We were only staying for 2 nights so decided to live with this. The room was in a poor state compared to the others, e.g. bathroom and lighting.   I cannot really recommend the hotel as getting a reasonable room would be a gamble. If they get refurbished with air conditioning etc then I would go back but next time it is going to be another hotel. 
-2; Tiny rooms, old decoration, noisy individual room air con,, electronic door locks that dont open half the time, I could go on and on. This hotel has seen the it's sunshine days scarper of the hill many moons ago! It's like your own personal time warp.  Quite simply dont waste your money and choose to stay here when you could stay accross the road at one of the other nearby hotels such as The Malmaison or The Crown Plaza. It isn't particularly cheap either! 
-2; Stayed here for a city break, upon arrival our faces did drop in disappointment as the building looked like a 1970's council housing block. The lady on reception was very friendly & professional.  The room was like an average chain hotel, there wasn't anything outstanding and I wouldn't honestly say it was worth a 4 star rating. The view from our room was of a dirty rooftop.  We paid for breakfast and I had read that they offered vegetarian options, so was looking forward to a vegetarian cooked breakfast with scrambled eggs (not a massive ask or very difficult). There was no scrambled eggs available on the hot breakfast buffet and when I asked for some of the advertised vegetarian sausages I was told there was none left (politely). Ended up with just toast & beans, could have got a better breakfast in any cafe.   On the whole I left feeling very disappointed, the only really positive thing was the friendly staff.  I complained about the breakfast to Hilton but they have not responded. 
-2; Was looking forward to staying at this hotel given reviews of the one in Glasgow. The room was not well lit and the dark wood furniture did little to lift the mood. The room had a musty smell and didn't feel clean. The bathroom was not better - a stain right down one of the walls from presumably a leak from above and the grouting etc could do with a clean. Shower was best thing about the room. To cap it all off the TV didn't work and despite telling reception, it wasn't fixed. 
-2; The good: Well located, convenient for Paddington. Nice reception area and helpful staff. Room was a reasonable size compared to some in London   The bad: Although the room was a reasonable size it had a third bed crammed in making it feel less luxurious.  The bathroom was tiny. Really tiny.  The sink was blocked.  The iron was dirty on the bottom The kettle switch didn't work unless you held it down.  The room was quite noisy over the main road even though I was told it was a quiet one at the side.   I stay a lot in London and felt this was expensive for a mediocre experience. Did not try breakfast as it was not included making it feel even more expensive.   I'd stay again but would be way down my list of choices.   
-2; The hotel accommodation was ok to good being placed across a driveway to a newer block. Obviously had flat roof leaks and in process of repair. Mould evident in bathroom and cobwebs in corridor. Booked 3 nights dinner and breakfast but cancelled after 1st night. evening meal was poor in quality and I watched many plates of uneaten food taken away. My wife took a sirloin that was stringy and lacked any flavour and I took the sea bass which consist of overcooked fish mounting courgettes. We did not complete the meal as fries were uncooked in the middle and had an earthy sea bass, did not take desert and complained to the staff. This ruined our stay and we decided to exit the the following morning. Breakfast was basic to say the least. The staff were perfect apart from comments such as burger and chips could be available in the Dartmoor bar( expensive and only decent ale's were bottled). Quite insulting really. l In short the food was well below what we expected so choose your food well. All staff were truly sorry and helpful but the end result was a ruined 3 night break. We have stayed at many hotels but found the food lacking greatly at this one . 
-2;" Check in straight forward enough, but without much cheer, other than a welcome stick of rock. Room on top floor, elevator felt like you were taking a bit of a chance, but was probably the most exciting thing about the place.  Room, facing the side street with the car park entrance and featuring a heavily restricted view towards the sea, was depressing. In need of a refurb and a deep clean; furniture dated and beds well worn. Ensuite appeared to have suffered with years of little or no air extraction, with rot and mound very present, along with body hairs from previous guests. Windows nice and dirty.  Communal areas were more pleasant than the room, although that's not saying much. Meeting room okay and lunch provided at least plentiful and varied. Late night bar wasn't properly manned, but night porter could rustle you up some drinks, if you could find him.  At breakfast, there was a good buffet selection and nice view. Location is excellent.  Check out staff seemed to have various issues operating the IT system, although they did manage to email invoices over, as their printer was inoperable. Man running the car park was pleasant.  Overall in no rush to go back. "
-2; Very disappointing. Not aware of builder work ongoing. Dirty dishes left outside rooms along corridors, with what appeared to be breakfast food leftovers. At 7:30pm! Poor breakfast selection / quality 
-2;" I am not sure how this hotel is rated four star. We visited for a five night stay last month. The room was cold as the radiator in our room didn't work, despite the best attempts of one of the hotel staff to fix it. We were given a fan heater while awaiting a repair and once fixed still required supplementary heating. One morning there was no hot water so suffered a cold shower. The hotel is in my view rather grubby, take a close look around the restaurant. When ordering an item off the breakfast menu, after a wait, we were told &quot;chef can't find any&quot;. All in all a disappointing experience. "
-2;There where five of us that went there for dinner for our friends birthday, we arrived in the reception area and waited for the young lady to finish with a guest. We informed her we had a reservation for dinner we where then told where the bar was and showed to the restaurant. We then went to the bar to have pre dinner drinks, the barman was very abrupt and trying to rush our drink order, when asked what brand of spirit was required when asked what have you got he sighed and rattled them off very quickly and came across very rude. we then went through to the restuarnt we sat on the terrace and it was very picturesque and very pleasant. For the prices charged I expected beautiful tasty food, very disappointed on the quantity's given. I ordered scallops to start and was very disappointed as £12 for one small scallop cut in half was a bit of a joke!!! I had steak for main course, again was very disappointed the meat was very tasty but again two mouthfuls it was gone so after spending nearly £300 had to get food on the way home. As we where there for a friends birthday we didn't want to ruin the evening by complianing so nothing was said. But probably not recommend to any one, but if you are on a diet if nil by mouth I am sure you will have your fill.  The restaurant staff are very good and competent. Thanks for reading  Tony Cheltenham
-2;"We were attending a conference in London and needed somewhere nice to stay; we have always had good to excellent experiences of the Accor chain so we booked here; the standard was nowhere near as good as the other hotels, despite being much more expensive.   As silver loyalty card members, we were offered a free welcoming drink; the bar's choice of wine was Blossom HIll or Blossom Hill - hardly extensive and hardly appropriate for a French chain to purvey average wine - Novotel Excel was far better. We would also point out that Ibis Style Rezé let me scoot around their foyer on their scooters which they provided, but Mercure had neither scooters or space for this   We were upgraded to a bigger room, but it was still titchy, approximately the size of the bathroom in our last Ibis Rezé room. The shower was minute so that we could not share the shower (to save water) despite each of us having BMI under 25. The toilet was very low and an elderly person would have difficulty rising from this; we did not see any elderly folk so they either did not stay or they were all stuck on the loo.   Next morning, breakfast was in the linked garfunkel's restaurant; there was a 35 minute delay for an English breakfast - mon dieu! the highlight of a hotel stay in the UK is the full English breakfast. We were given a table, but had to get the cutlery from other tables, and had to grab the server to get served coffee rather than them coming to attend to our needs. And we got a cup of coffee, not a flask but one cup. So we had the continental breakfast which included some things labelled croissants - they were not standard croissant shape and they were more like brioche bread - definately not croissants - we left them cos we did not think even the pigeons would eat them.   The bed was shorter than average; it did have the overlay, but it was not quite as good as in the other IBis Hotels etc, or it did not seem as good. We did have a good night's sleep and the noise from the tube trains was barely noticeable.   The free WiFi was easy and fast; the staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful, but the staff in the garfunkels were disorganised and not attentive to guests   The stay was exceptionally poor value for money. we had a far better experience in Rezé, Ciboure for far less; OK, it is a capital city, but we had a better stay for less in IBis Style Hotel Landon at Paris and a fantastic stay for less at Ibis Style, Genève (and switzerland is generally expensive).    I think one of the problems is the area; it is crowded and dingy with few decent eating establishments and my partner was short changed by one of the local shops. But we would not go again, even if someone else was paying. We would chose an Accor hotel in a different area."
-2; Checked in Friday October 18th for two nights. We were in a Group and this hotel was highly recommended. Dinner was awful, cold and tasteless. My wife and I were advised there was no more fish to replace!!! Saturday night was lamb shank. Finely chopped meat was served in a pyramid shape, a bit like a kebab.Never seen anything like it, certainly not a lamb shank as we know it. Air conditioning in room not working even though turned on. I was advised on check out that I should have complained as the master unit had been turned off probably due to a previous guest saying they were cold. All in all a bad experience 
-2; I booked 2 nights at the Hyatt. When I arrived, the room I was given smelt of stale smoke. They quickly changed my room. The new room smelt better, but the air conditioning was noisy which a whistle and the shower pathetic - it was not just a pressure issue but the shower head looked like something from 1950. So I complained and spoke to the manager who was very good. He persuaded me to stay and moved me to a suite, which albeit was very nice and the shower considerably better BUT.... another room with a revolting smell of stale smoke. Breakfast - don't bother - really not great. I had also booked a club room to get the use of the club lounge - again don't bother - this closes and you have only a short period when you can actually use the lounge. A waste of time.  There are better hotels in Birmingham. I cannot understand how this hotel rates so well! However the staff are lovely. 
-2;" on arrival the welcome was dreadful. the lady behind reception never smiled, greeted us with the time of day or even made eye contact. check in may as well be automated by similar devices to those self service machines in super markets. maybe more frustrating but probably have more personality. the rooms i am ok with because it was clean and the bed is comfortable; small yes but staying away i don't want to spend a lot of time in the room so its no big deal. asked the hotel to order us a taxi didn't attempt to find phone numbers just sent someone outside to flag 2 down for us. we could have done that without wasting 10 minutes asking for &quot;help&quot;. the breakfast is good nothing special but there is a good range of food to try. overall if you aren't staying in london long and don't spend time in the room its ok to stay there. real disappointed in the welcome and the staff have no friendliness or personalities in them. not once did i feel it was worth approaching anybody rather than just figuring it out on our own. "
-2; I'm not sure if the staff know what service is. I do a lot of driving and try to break my journeys up by visiting places en-route. However, the first night seemed to have unusually lousy service (40 minutes to get served), then when a friend came for the second night we actually gave up trying to get any service and went elsewhere. When I enquired of the manageress, she said they had been un-usually busy that weekend, but I saw no signs of activity. However, last weekend I popped in to see if there was any improvement in the service and found cold food, served late with the manageress 'absent'....  
-2; Arrived at the hotel at around 9.30 and checked in. Arrived at my room but the pillows were missing and someone had been lying on one side of the bed. Lady at reception had that taken care of. (Oh tried to call the hotel on the way there - no answer, and this happened on 2 other occasions - you can see why when you are in reception as they don't answer the phone and ask you to hold or offer to call back when they are serving customers). Food supposed to be available until 11pm at the bar or via room service. Managed to get to the bar at 9.55pm to be told that the kitchen was closed, and that the bar menu, which stated 11pm, must need updating. Hot food room service was not available and I was offered a sandwich, or told the nearest takeaway was a chinese and was in town..... Room was fine and clean - everything else worked as it should - Hotels need to be at the top of their game now to get another stay as the competition is high and standards are high. It wasn't cheap cheap, so I am afraid I won't be staying again and the local Prem Inn will get my business next time 
-2; Stayed on business and soon as the lights were off heard mice/rats scurrying around in roof space. Couldn't be bothered to change room by then and ended up realising this was a mistake when woken up at 3 in the morning again by the noise. Have never come across this in a major international hotel. WIFI free but so slow as to be pretty much useless so couldn't even get any work done while I listened to the rat olympics above my head. 
-2;" Stayed twice this week, first room a family room which was large and well furnished. Second a double, both had nice comfortable beds but only the family room had pillows i found comfortable. On one night though they forgot to leave me towels, this meant the embarrassing position of having to answer the door in less than presentable appearance after waiting 15mins.   Later in the week the light failed in my bathroom, this resulted in the light blinking on off continuously, making a shower uncomfortable and dangerous, I reported this defect but no one appeared, I had to go to work next day without a shower.  In both rooms the WiFi was slow, it was fine till 6 then after that frequent disconnections.  On all the problems above the following was offered:-  Towels:- &quot;Sorry&quot; (this is fine only a minor problem) Wifi:- &quot;Is it an apple device we have problems with them here, no one else has phoned down!&quot;. (it wasn't it was a PC and a iphone and ipad)  Light and lack of shower:- &quot;ooooh thats strange can't believe no one appeared&quot; "
-2; I stayed here for one night prior to flying out of Birmingham airport for a weeks holiday, I had parking included for the week. Firstly the location is good close to the airport which is a plus particularly with parking included. However this hotel should definetly not be rated 4 star. On check in there was only one person on reception and a queue, no one seemed interested in doing anything to reduce this. On being checked in nothing was explained of the parking or how to get to the airport, I was just told 'go and see concierge'. Having checked in I then went to concierge to find 3 members of staff standing talking who seemed very uninterested and again did not offer up much information on how the parking worked. Not 4 star service.  On finally reaching my room I found the state of cleanliness to be extremely poor, my partner even took a photo of his name written in the dust on the headboard. The bathroom was mouldy and everywhere looked like it needed a good scrub. This aside, I was at least hoping for a good sleep ready for an early morning flight.  However, the hotel was hosting some sort of Elvis convention on the Sunday night and I can honestly say I have never slept so badly. The guests were partying right up until the moment we boarded the shuttle to the airport at 530 in the morning. People were running up and down the corridors screaming and shouting and there was fighting in the car park beneath our room. I was appalled that a Hilton hotel would allow guests to behave in this way and the concierge in the morning just acted like it was the norm. We both managed to get only snatched moments of sleep. I am a member of Hilton honors and recently stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in New York which was simply breathtaking but after this experience I would definetly think twice before ever booking with Hilton again. Take my advice and book the Crowne Plaza, far better. Go to the hilton birmingham if you like bad service, poor cleanliness and being kept awake all night. 
-2;" We stayed for two nights and won't be back. Upon arrival we were told that it was policy to take money for our stay and no wonder, because one look at the place and we were ready to leave.  While the staff seemed friendly enough and the rooms tidy, it was quite clear that this so called four star hotel has very old fashioned values.  The first sign of this was the smell all over the room corridors, followed by the old fashioned rooms, shoe polish and sewing kit. Not exactly modern. The shower also seems to have a habit of going cold all the time.  The only thing I wanted to use in the room, the iron board, was broken. Luckily we weren't interested in staying in our room much.  At least the bed was comfortable, although the worst was yet to come as we went to breakfast.   It was obvious at first sight that breakfast would be an issue. There were no tables in sight, all being taken up by the hotels mostly mature patrons, in fact I even heard one say, &quot;where are all the young people&quot;. There was people queuing out the door and when we got a table it was still dirty and full of plates. Eventually our table was cleared and our drinks and toast order taken. We were told to go get our breakfast, I waited till my wife came back and when she did she said nothing hot was left. I waited for the refill, only to be greeted by burnt eggs (literally black). I salvaged what I could and we both finished our breakfast, though still no drinks had arrived and when they eventually did it was the wrong drinks. We walked out at that point having had enough.  The next morning we made sure to get down as early as we could. It was very quiet and better service, although we still struggled to get our drinks, with the waitress walking around every table but ours.  We're glad we didn't stay for three nights.  I've stayed at many types of hotels as you'll see from my other reviews and this was by far the worst of all.  It's in a great location and has free parking, hence the two stars, but that's about all it has going for it to be honest. "
-2; I recently stayed at the Compleat Angler for 2 nights and I was not impressed at all. We were really excited about staying and hope the stay would be magical but it was not.  The problems were that the rooms are not as good as one would expect with a prices as high as they are. In my room one of the bed lamps was not working and the walls were dirty with scuff marks, it just felt a little run down.  The staff except 2 people - Miguel (at the Bar), the Concierge gentleman (sorry I forgot his name) - seemed to make life harder than it needed to be, those two were lovely and very helpful. The service on the terrace at afternoon tea was particularly slow but this was ok as the setting is magical. I was hoping the service would be better considering the prices of the drinks were so high....It is £9 for a glass of wine!!   The breakfast was great, and the service then could not be faulted, it was attentive, quick and served with a lovely smile from all the staff then.  On checking out and getting the bill you are then hit with something which I think is just awful and they should be ashamed to call themselves a decent hotel chain! You are charged to use your credit card - Now i know it is only £2 but when you are spending above the odds for a water, coke, glass of wine, and sandwich the last think you think they will do is charge you for actually paying your bill!! This was the final straw for me and I will rant about this for a long time as I just think that it is so wrong!  So Good Points:  Breakfast Miguel Concierge Man Comfy Beds Amazing Setting  Bad Points:  General Service Price of drinks, food etc.... The 12.5% service charge added on your bill! Small rooms The £2 charge to pay your bill with a Credit Card  Overall the hotel could be amazing if it was run properly, there just seems as if there is a small problem somewhere. 
-2;" I was in Nottingham for a show with my brother and booked a twin room here as Premier Inn was full. The first thing that alarmed me was the hotel's policy of taking a £50 payment from your card on top of the room rate. At no point in the booking process was I told about this and if I was I would've cancelled and gone elsewhere. The receptionist was very friendly and explained that it is normal policy in most hotels, well I have NEVER experienced this in any hotel I have ever stayed in and neither had the women in front of us at reception who weren't best pleased about discovering this. The receptionist said that they would've been told at the time of booking but they weren't and nor was I. I even overheard a gentleman (perhaps a manager?) who worked there ask the receptionist afterwards &quot;Was that about the £50 again?&quot; So I assume lots of guests query this, quite frankly ridiculous, policy. Another thing is they try and claim it's not a payment, as we get the money back after checking out and the room hasn't been damaged, but for those few days before having the money returned I can't spend it so for people on a tight budget it's a massive inconvenience. We were given a voucher for a free glass of wine at the bar after checking in which was a nice gesture  Another problem is the hotel has recently been refurbished and our room, whilst clean and nicely decorated smelled of paint, it wasn't overpowering but still noticeable. Also we couldn't watch TV as there was no remote control in the room! Other than that the room was clean, the beds comfortable and bathroom spacious and well stocked with shower gel, shampoo etc.  Breakfasts costs £8 and sadly it's not value for money. There is plenty of choice, including cereals and continental options, but the cooked breakfast is from a buffet and it was freezing cold! They ran out of eggs and it took an age to bring more out and my brother had to ask for a plate as nobody brought out any more once the stack next to the buffet ran out. In most hotels you get asked if you want tea or coffee when you first sit down but we weren't asked until we were nearly finished. As I don't drink much tea or coffee this wasn't really a problem for me but could be for others.   Overall this hotel isn't as good as it thinks it is or could be. The potential is there, it's clean and the rooms are nice but too many disappointing things happened for me to consider going back. Sadly I can't recommend. "
-2; booked a 1 night Spa break for our wedding anniversary through lastminute.com/Wahanda. you have to book the package before the spa treatments by doing this only 2 were available one 3 hours before check in and 1 at dinner time. but we weren't able to cancel our booking. we provisionally booked these 2 times whilst Amy at Wahanda tried to get alternative times for us but at no point was the website updated and the package was still available 2 days later even though no treatments would be available and it had a no cancel policy. i was told this was down to the Hilton to update the site.  we were also able to apply for a complimentary room upgrade if available so i emailed the hotel to try and book one. still waiting for a reply. the room we were given (513) was most probably the worst i have stayed in. on arrival it was very cold as the window had been left open. when i closed it i soon realised why this had been done the room was very musty and really stank. the sheets and pillows were the same. why didn't i complain at the time? because i had gone away to relax and chill out and not spend the weekend complaining that is what these websites are for. on checking out the receptionist advised me that i had an extra £40 to pay. i asked for an itemised bill before paying which they couldn't provide but said it was something i had in the restaurant, maybe things have changed but every hotel that i have ever stayed in provide you with an itemised bill before payment. when i explained this i think they thought i was talking in a foreign language so I paid and then received a bill which still didn't show what the extra cost was, i knew what it was for but still wanted confirmation.  the treatments were lovely and thank you Wahunda for finding us more suitable times.  lesson learnt from this experience - don't stay at a Hilton and never book a spa package without checking the availability first even though it says to book the package first. 
-2;we stayed over for a New Years Eve treat. We had booked a meal at the Marco pierre White restaurant. We arrived at around 5pm. The first thing we noticed was that the lights were not on in the car park, which was very dark. The room we had booked was to cost £140 so we were expecting an element of luxury, a great bed and some nice touches. (it was disapointing to note that no breakfast was included at this price) We were also hoping to have a swim prior to getting ready for dinner.Our room was 027, quite a walk from the reception we were not offered help with our luggage. The room was OK, but the bed was extremely hard, to the extent that both of us had little sleep. I would like to know how these beds were selected. The swimming pool was closed at either 5 or 6pm, so no chance of a swim prior to getting ready. I wanted a coffee whilst getting ready, but only nescafe was provided and a very limited amount of milk. This is not reflective of a £140 per night room, i have stayed in hotels where much better quality coffees and beds are provided, certainly, even the budget hotel chains provide more comfortable beds. At this price point, we need a reason to want to come back. Needless to say we will not be going back. The meal at Marco Pierre White restaurant was very good, if not a little rushed but the food quality was spot on, as was the service ( I would prefer to be served by just one person and for them to offer to slow the service down as the meal was 6 courses rather than be asked) Wine was VERY overpriced a bottle of Gavi was £32. although the wine was acceptable, the extremely high price made the enjoyment level less. I would not expect to pay more than £8 at supermarket for this wine, so around £25 at the top end in the restaurant would be correct, Certainly the glass of Rose house wine we bought in the ballroom bar later at £5 per glass was EXTREMELY poor quality, I would not pay any more than £5 per bottle for this wine. All in all, I am left thinking that Nearly £400 was not money well spent with Hilton and would not book again. I will seek a response from Hilton and see what they have to say, however i am not expecting much sympathy.
-2; At first appearance this hotel seems ok, reasonable surroundings inside & out, reasonably clean and staff very polite & accommodating. End of the good bit !  The food leaves a lot to be desired, in fact not good at all. Breakfast buffet on both mornings was all very previously cooked and put out - and was sweating in its own grease.   At dinner, on Friday the 22nd May, it was a carvery which I had to decline due to the meat servers bare hands on the joints of meat and his lack of fingernail cleanliness or hygienic gloves to cover his dirty hands ! I settled for a few cold cuts on the 'help yourself ' counter and hoped our friend had not had a part in preparing these.   At dinner, on Saturday evening, the 23rd May, the starter was very good, the main course (Chicken) was abominable, the chicken was dry and un-appetising with very few vegetable's, a few French beans and fewer potatoes. The dessert was non-descript.  Finally, on our departure, the morning of the 24th. May, I mistakenly left a few items of clothing (four in no.), in the room, two of these brand new with the labels still attached and a charger for my tablet, about £46 in total value. I did not realise these were gone until I un-packed the following day at home. I knew exactly where I had left the items, the clothing was left in the top right-hand drawer of the dresser next to the suitcase stand. The charger was still plugged in to the left-hand side of the bed. I rang the hotel on the same day, (Monday), and the staff member I spoke to said she would make enquiries and phone me back. The following day (Tuesday) I was called from the hotel and told nothing was found in the room (226) we had stayed in. I did leave a gratuity in the room as it was well cleaned during our stay, also at reception for the politeness of the reception & waiting staff, this was before I missed my clothing & charger. Had I have known I would not see these items again I would not have. 
-2; My wife and I came here for a long weekend in August. When we booked the reviews were largely positive and photos looked good so we expected a good mini break. Unfortunately the hotel is not of a good standard. The carpets from the carpark to reception were old and worn out. I didn't really think too much of it at this point and duly checked in to the premier room we had booked. The room itself was large, with a large bathroom with great views over the lake, unfortunately the views were restricted by the state of the windows which were cloudy and dirty. The room wasn't very clean either and looked generally shabby and run down. The decor is incredibly dated and looks untouched since the 80s. The bed was very uncomfortable and felt every spring during a nights sleep. The bathroom is similar to the bedroom again very dated, our shower cubicle had mold and was generally dirty.  Step outside the room and the outdated, shabby design theme is repeated throughout the hotel. It is such a frustrating and underwhelming feeling especially considering the prices the hotel charge which are not representative of the service or quality received.   There are some positives to the hotel. The staff at the hotel did try to resolve our issues and provide a good a service as the hotel itself permits. The restaurant to the hotel is probably the only redeeming feature, the quality of food is very good and stopped this review being scored lower. The spa area is also nice and the views are great.  It is such a shame as this hotel could be so much more, it urgently needs modernising throughout. I wouldn't stay here again. 
-2; Stayed May Bank Holiday 3-5 May 2013  Stayed in an executive room on the 2nd floor in the new wing. On entry to hotel you first see double glazed doors adjacent to swimming pool area but they could do with a larger reception area, queues on checkout were long and took on average 10 mins to checkout. Staff were friendly. On Sunday morning they ran out of breakfast buffet, people were waiting over 15mins to get breakfast, would have thought a bank holiday would mean extra catering for full capacity. Sunday evening in the restaurant, witnessed a chair collapse under a customer (not obese). The condition of the room left a lot to be desired for the price! Our room was over the pool area and constant noise from the pool pumps throughout the night was a nuisance and disturbed sleep for all three nights. Room possessed no air conditioning or a fridge, for an executive room in a 4 star hotel, the quality of furnishings and decor was surprisingly poor. Probably needed a refurb 10 years ago! Definitely not a £160 per night room. Quality of breakfast was poor and choice was limited, lack of quantity didn't help as staff service couldn't keep up with the capacity of customers. Quality of food in the restaurant was decent, staff made the stay palatable. Overall bitterly disappointed, pictures on website very misleading as not a true representation of reality. For the £600 spent, would have been better off booking a city break abroad. 
-2;" For a smart hotel, it's disappointing that a large table of shouting drunk yobos were allowed to remain and disturb everyone else's dinner on Saturday 31st October 2015. It was so loud that we had difficulty having a conversation, even though we were sitting as far away as was possible in the restaurant. The sort of behaviour I am talking about is that which would result in immediate ejection from any reputable restaurant, including what might generously be described as &quot;horsing around&quot;, shouting, singing as loudly as possible, standing on the chairs and falling over. The staff were very apologetic, but may I point out that they were the ones serving up the drink in the first place and continued to fuel the drunkards during and after their &quot;dinner&quot;. Will the management stipulate that no rowdy drunk groups will be present at dinner in the future:YES OR NO? If yes, then I will be happy to return and I sincerely hope that I will be able to write a more encouraging review. "
-2;Every year we stay at a Heathrow hotel the night before we fly in the morning the next day long haul. This is for 2 reasons. Firstly to miss the joys and panics the M25 can throw at you and secondly to start the day refreshed after a good nights sleep , ready for the long journey ahead. The hotel is just like most of the others in as much once inside you would have trouble identifying which hotel you were in , which is not a bad thing, its just the way it is. However , unless you are used to sleeping without pillows do not stay here. This may seem such a trivial thing, but the experience of constant waking trying to get comfy and feeling shattered before the day has begun was awful. I ususally sleep on 1 pillow but the pillows provided had the amaizing properties of completely flatening like a deflated balloon.  Get more pillows you say, we did and they made no difference at all. Horrible. We did a package combining a couple of weeks parking with an overnight stay at the beginning but where they make you park is round the back, on a grassy inclinded bank under trees that emit super glue, so after a 2 week period getting the stuff off the car was much fun indeed. We paid about £180 for the experience. Previously I have not paid this much for far better. I dont want to sound like a moaner but the sleep experience bought back memories of the sleep I used to get when the kids were babies.
-2; The staff are great - but my highest priority is a good night sleep in a room which I am at the very least happy with.  The room - Tables with loose fixings/legs, handles and knobs missing from drawers, cup ring stains on surfaces, blocked shower head.  I would compare the furnishing to second hand quality. Soft furnishings torn and stained, wall coverings (yes wall paper) ripped, torn, scuffed and lifting. The bed was uncomfortable.   I've stayed here a number of times because my company uses the conference rooms and I am sadly let down every time. 
-2;" A little bit of a mixed bag this hotel....check in was very slow, foyer well presented but the room was rather tired for such a modern looking hotel and extremely &quot;compact&quot;. I stay in London frequently and often thought that I may book into the hotel on business....but I booked up for a weekend break with my wife & friends instead as it was located right next to the bridge. Heating in the room was non-existent and we ended up having a portable heater delivered. Bathroom extremely tired also. The View of St Katherine's Dock was very pleasing however, as was the view of the London Eye from my friends room.....so for the views its a good venue!....its location is also a plus - as you cannot get any closer to the City action.  However - overall not a fantastic hotel and would not stay there by choice again. "
-2; During our stay we were informed that the hotel is currently for sale and explains the recent lack of investment to bring this hotel up to the advertised standard. Random outdated furniture in the communal rooms, neglected exterior and gardens. Stayed in room 12 in the Coach House which was the only room available for a late booking and hence a reduced price of £80. Sleeping was difficult as you could feel the springs in the very soft mattress, supported on an old divan with a sheet of MDF! Reported this to the manageress in reception who said it would be replaced during the winter shutdown.. a bit late! Never experienced carpet in a bathroom before, which can only be unhygienic. Overpriced and outdated and in desperate need of new owners and new investment. 
-2;"Visited this hotel in May 2016 as part of a Theatre trip. The first thing to say is that the Hotel is ideally located for anyone visiting the many theatre's nearby, we went to the Savoy Theatre and enjoyed a 20 minute walk in the sun to get there from the Hotel.  The Hotel itself is clean and tidy, although for me not worth the £238 per night that was advertised before we received a deal via our booking site and paid only half of that. Now it may have been a coincidence but we were obviously allocated a discount room to go with our discount price.   From the moment that we arrived it was clear that our tolilet was broken and would not flush, therefore I reported this to Reception who informed me that I needed to &quot;pump it a few times and then it flushes&quot; I tried to explain that the flush mechanism had actually come away from the toilet cistern, therefore all the pumping in the world was not going to help.  During our stay (for 1 night) I reported the toliet on 3 occasions, and was informed each time that someone would look at this however, no one ever arrived and we could not flush the toliet throughout our stay.  To make matters worse there was nothing offered to us to help the situation and they even had the cheek to take a £6 payment from my card for a bottle of water and some snacks from the tray in our room.  All in all a dissapointing stay in Hotel that clearly undervalue customer service.  Why am I writing this review 2 months after our stay? Beacuse I wrote to the Hotel following our stay and have given them 6 weeks to respond but still nothing, which kind of emphasises my point about poor customer service."
-2; We arrived at around ten past four on Saturday which was where Saturday began to go wrong with it taking 20 minutes to book in. The member of staff could barely understand my English (which I believe is standard English) which led to a number of misunderstandings such as being taken aback when I asked for our case to be taken to the room (having stayed there 3 months before I knew how far the room was and having an injured foot). As a Platinum member we ordered free complimentary drinks and snack and were told it would be at our room by 5pm. At 1722, no drink/snack so I rang both room service and 0 and received no reply for 8 minutes so hobbled off to the reception desk and complained eventually speaking to the duty manager who apologised and arranged for a complimentary bottle of wine at our table in the Grill that evening which was welcome. Eventually at around 1800 the drinks/snack arrived. At the restaurant, the waiting staff were good but the length of time between ordering the starter, main course and sweet (20-30 minutes each time, including the sweet which was complimentary because of the long waits). Eventually after 2 and 3/4 hours hours we finished our meal (2145) and returned with our 2 young boys to find their bed had not been prepared. As I was near the reception I again went to complain and was asked if I had asked for it to be done!! Seeing as I had booked into an executive room for 4 people (2 adults, 2 young children) I replied I didn't think I had to!!! After 10 minutes back at the room the duty manager called and said he would come shortly to make the bed himself which he did. The next day was completely the opposite with excellent service, it was likely being in 2 different hotels. Further, the food was always excellent and the chef at breakfast on the last day was particularly good. Overall, the staff were friendly but obviously not numerous enough and required training (reception?) with it would appear also breakdowns in communication happening frequently. Apparently there had been a high turnover of staff recently and it was the 'busy' period but a 5 star hotel should cater for that. I have stayed in a number of 'Marriott' hotels in the past, including this one, but due to the first days stay would be reluctant to recommend this Marriott hotel which appears to be having problems at the moment. 
-2; Holiday Inn's come with a standard, sadly this is dated and getting close to needing a refurb.  Rooms are comfortable but small dingy and have an annoying night long hum and the sound of water flowing through pipes in the ceiling.  The spirit health club was, grim. The pool was dirty, a sauna broken, the hot tub cold.  Needs a refurb soon, to keep upto speed 
-2; Arrived at 4.30 after a 200 mile drive to be told that all the facilities--bar etc were shut because of a wedding reception. So we had to go out to get a cup of tea or sit in our room a room with décor which was obviously experimental and unfortunately the experiment failed.. The en-suite in our room was a joke with a small shower with no door a wash basin with very little space to put anything and a toilet. No nice toiletries which you would expect for what we were paying, the whole experience was very underwhelming. Add to that a lift (yes I know its a listed building) which was so slow as to make using the stairs the better and quicker option and a bar/dining area which was in some way supposed to convey the buildings history but only managed to bring to mind a school canteen designed by a nine year old. We have stayed in most of the decent hotels in Liverpool over the last 15 years or so and this is by far the worst. . 
-2;" The sad thing about my experiences at the Menzies Carlton Hotel in Bournemouth this weekend (31 Aug 2014 for 1 night) is that the overall feeling could be addressed quite easily if staff were trained to smile, make eye contact and act like the customer exists as a person.  The Building itself is old but this in itself should be celebrated however much of it has been left to fade without quality attention. For instance the bar leading into the restaurant has been repainted but the paint has been splashed at the edges and has covered the beautiful timber surrounds. Who is allowing this to happen? The painters employed should be of at least a competent standard but who at Menzies Carlton checked it and signed this off as OK? It is just shoddy and gives the impression the owners and operators don't really care about standards.  On arriving at the hotel we were a couple of hours early for check in, it was a busy weekend as the Bournemouth Air Show was on and we had booked a room with a view over the sea front so we could watch the show. We therefore paid £171.00 for 2 people for 1 night; it is purported to be a 4 star hotel and were happy to pay this for a good quality room, in a good quality 4 star hotel with a great view. We arrived early, there was no one else in reception but we were ignored by the staff on duty. We finally got their attention and explained the situation, the room was not ready but they allowed us to park the car. They did no offer to store our luggage, which I would expect of a 4 star hotel.  We were finally allowed into our about 5 minutes before 3:00pm; please remember this because it matters at check out. The room was a lovely size and with a great balcony and view. The room decorations were acceptable if uninspired and with some poor workmanship to ceiling repairs. The bed was very comfortable, the TV was too small for a 4 star room of this size, the desk/TV unit and wardrobe were smart enough if a little lost in the room. The easy chairs and table were fine BUT - there was NO WiFi available. Please explain how any hotel that purports to be 4 star can not make WiFi available in 2014. This again just says to me that there is no management attention given to making sure this hotel meets the needs of travellers in the 21st century. Over the last 5 years I have stayed in all sorts of hotels from 3 star to 5 star in various places in the world that we in the UK would consider somewhat 3rd world, yet this is the first hotel in all those years that does not have WiFi, I did not even ask before taking the room but it seems to me a bog standard requirement in 2014.  The bathroom was adequate, some bits old some new but they all worked. Complaints with the bathroom - a couple: I don't know who is doing the design at this hotel but it is not up to an acceptable standard. the sink taps are new, cheap and made in China no doubt, which is not a problem (the Chinese make some good quality stuff), the problem is that the selection of taps is not suitable for a hotel. The handles to turn on the hot & cold are thin and the edges could cut into your fingers. the shower worked kind of OK if a little weak but the shower curtain!! Again I do not understand how in a 4 star hotel the shower curtain is flimsy and carried on a semi-circular rail that is too small. The result is that as soon as the water hits your body the curtain sticks to any part of you within a millimetre.  Once in our room we opened the balcony doors and I set about ordering a jug of Pimms. I started with calling room service but it rang and rang until it cut off. So I tried again, same result. I next tried reception, it rang and rang - no one answered. I tried room service again - same result. I then tried the hotel operator, guess what - no one picked up!!! This is outrageous at a 2 star hotel but at the 4 star Menzies Carlton Hotel it is appalling. In the end I walked down to the bar and met Katy who was working a busy bar, she was superb, out of all the staff we met on our stay she was the only member of staff that made eye contact and let you know that she knew you existed, even though she was busy with another customer. She dealt with my complaint about ringing room service, reception and the operator professionally and with empathy but without any criticism of her colleagues -even though they had let her down.  The restaurant is shabby and faded as the rest of the hotel, staff uniforms are obviously getting old with some shiny patches on the men's trousers and jackets in need of pressing. It was however clean. Attentiveness of staff was OK for an average 3 star hotel, but this is not marketed or charged as such and 4 star service it was not. Staff were friendly enough but never seemed to be around when you needed them. Needless to say the food was charged at fine dining rates but this just misses the mark so is overcharged.  All in all this was a very expensive exercise in staying in a below par hotel with no excuses. Training staff to be attentive, friendly and helpful should be basic training in any half decent hotel, for a 4 star hotel with this heritage it is unforgivable.  I would not recommend anyone staying at this hotel until the either address the shortcomings and lift the hotel to 4 star standard where they can justify overcharging. Or stop pretending this is 4 star hotel, be honest and lower your rates accordingly. "
-2;as we were only stopping for one night for £65 pound i found it was very over priced. good points about the hotel nice comfy bed, good location from warick castle, friendley staff at reception. bad points £5 to park your car for 24 hours is ridiculous and a fee of £24 pound for a lost ticket. bar was overpriced breakfast wasnt included wich was an extra charge of 15 pound each! in the room had a dirty sink poor water pressure on the shower and stains on the curtains. the cleaners didnt understand a word of english an we also had our bill put under our door at 4am in the morning whats that about? will be looking to find another hotel in future for better value for money.
-2; Booked this place for a romantic weekend away. I envisioned lounging around the spacious room we had booked and venturing out in to the countryside to eat, drink and explore.  The Stag Lodge had other ideas.  It appears that all the rooms have a quick shut mechanism on the doors, the sort you would find in a hostel, and as a result slam very loudly no matter how careful you are. I essentially spent two days being woken morning, noon and night by other guests. The front door, next to our room, is also on the loud side. I was exhausted for the entire trip. To say it ruined our weekend would be a gross understatement.  We complained on the first morning and a sign was put on the front door.  At checkout I told the young girl manning the desk that we had an awful couple nights sleep. Rather than apologising she proceeded to argue with me and was quite insistent that they had done all they could. She told me, quite matter-of-factly, that they had received complaints before about the noise from the doors as if I should have been aware of the problem and graciously accepted my two nights of being jolted awake every 15 minutes. I wasn't asking for freebies or discounts! I, like any customer paying close to £400 for two nights stay, simply wanted my complaint to be acknowledged in a professional and respectful manner. What I got was a raised eyebrow and a shrug. I felt completely mugged handing over my bank card. It has to be some of the worst customer service I've encountered in years. It really is a great example of why British people don't choose to holiday at home.   Are you thinking of booking the Stag Lodge? My advice is don't bother unless you have a hankering for the type of exhaustion only a teething child can provide. 
-2; Error after error, Dirty Spa, Staff walking in Hotel room without knocking, dead flowers on tables, No communication back after feedback forms completed, rude staff, Cold food, Terrible Drinks offerrings, Generally Tatty 
-2;" Things didn't start out well. Having booked several weeks ago & paid in full at the time of booking, I was somewhat preturbed to be left a message on my mobile whilst on business in Istanbul along the lines of &quot;we dont accept diners card so you have to call us with an alternative card or your room may be cancelled&quot;.......... I arrived after a very taxing day, 50 mins prior to the official check in time of 2pm to be told that &quot;there might not be any rooms ready, check in is at 2pm you know&quot; - Yes, i do know and I am only 50 mins early.....anyway, my room was ready after a short wait so no real issues there although I do think the receptionist was bordering on rude (she did improve however). I had to check in, prepare an hours work then leave the hotel again so I didnt realise the rooms proximity to the 4 lane highway 20ft from my window. As I had specifically requested 'A quiet room' at the time of booking I would have expected to be allocated a room at the back but by the time I got back to the hotel I just thought I would see how it went. I engaged the 'Do Not disturb' sign and went for an hours sleep as I had a late night ahead of me. 25 mins into the sleep, i was rudely awakened by the room phone...&quot;Just checking the rooms is ok sir&quot; said a voice...So much for the DND sign said I. The room was chilly, I couldnt figure out the heating/cooling system - too many options & no instructions - it was still chilly the following morning. My laptop connected to the wifi ok but none of my other devices would load the landing page. At night, sleeping was not easy. The bed was fine, the road noise not. I was busy the next morning so I didnt partake of breakfast, I was however, still charged for it (this was soon rectified).  I assume this is a busy hotel, they didnt seem to care much about repeat custom. It does have its good points, location, car park, close to metro but, for the prices charged, there are most certainly better and I will go elsewhere next month. "
-2;The room was nice but had a empty mini bar..dirt up the walls no facilities for making tea or coffee and an empty mini bar..after been at a wedding all day this was not good when you wake up and need a drink..we where never tools about the 20 parking charges and hadb2 drinks at the bar which totaled 22 pounds..not a good experience
-2; Beautiful hotel and great venue for the party, bar staff helpful and friendly, rooms OK, showers could do with updating but having paid for superior room - questionable. Marred only by one very noticeable customer service fopah. Having been at a party where we spent thousands with the hotel were told quite abruptly at breakfast by the young man in the suit that we were 15 minutes late for breakfast (at 9.45am) and therfore despite having paid for a bed and breakfast deal we could not have any !! So focus on your customers not the rules, breakfast at 9.45 on a sunday is not too much to ask and in fact as we all left that was the abruptness of the individual was the talking point of the partyand not the great time we had. Retraining required ! 
-2; We stayed here for my birthday thought we would push the boat out at £200 a night for an executive double well what a complete let down this hotel was i've had more luxury in the premier inn the TV was not working the furnishing and fittings all very dated and falling apart the room 208 which we stayed in was cold the shower door did not close properly when we stopped at the bar for a night cap there was no cream for a white russian i would like to know what is executive about room 208 because i couldn't find anything 
-2; Booked this hotel as a base near Park Lane for a one night stay for our family of 5, me and my wife, my younger daughter and her husband, and my elder daughter. I booked and pre-paid 3 rooms all doubles. We wanted somewhere close to Park Lane, but without the astronomic prices. At check-in we were informed that my elder daughter had been downgraded from a Double to a Single as “the hotel was overbooked”, even though I had paid in advance for a Double ! I argued with Reception but to no avail as they insisted that a lot of single-occupancy Doubles had likewise been downgraded. They indicated that the price differential between Double and Single would be refunded, but that really isn't the point ! We checked into our room on the ground floor, the smallest and darkest room we’d ever stayed in ! Had we been staying more than one night I would have demanded a refund and gone somewhere else. As previous reviewers have already noted the beds are far from comfortable. The bar is also worth a miss, soulless and dull. Give the Rioja a miss as well, £7.15 for a glass of undrinkable plonk. I complained and wasn't charged. 
-2;Shower was stuck on hot!!! In our suite and no other suites were available, we were offered a standard room but it was a special evening for my self and my partner so the standard room didn't cut it. We checked out the same evening and headed home with a full refund.
-2; I had a tiny single room which was clean but a bit in need of refurbishment. The bathroom was fine. The whole thing was expensive for what I got. A chain hotel would have been better. Good breakfast. Not happy to see a lot of fire doors wedged open at night. 
-2; Initial impression of the hotel was not good ... and it went downhill from there! The reception area is black, matt black and very poorly lit. The hallways and elevators are the same. I've never visited a brothel but I imagine this is what one would look like on the inside - dark and seedy. I don't know what ambience they are trying to achieve but it certainly wasn't a romantic retreat for a married couple - maybe a place to visit if you're with someone you shouldn't be with. The bedroom was just as bad - black walls, black decor and dimly lit. Makes you wonder what they are trying to hide. We stayed in a Deluxe Room with a huge and well equipped bathroom which again was black with low lighting. Everything that you would expect from a good hotel was there, it just didn't feel comfortable or clean (although it probably was). Also, the night club next door closes at 3 am. The noise is fairly constant before then but really picks up at 3 when the club empties onto the street directly outside and this doesn't really die down until around 4am when the last of the stragglers and brawlers are moved on by staff or the police. We would have closed the window but the room was so stuffy - with useless air-conditioning and the oppressive black walls we felt like we were in a crypt. We were looking forward to our time away together but we had a terrible experience here and will never, even remotely, consider staying in this hotel again. For £130 per night we could get so much better than this elsewhere 
-2;I booked on HH points and selected a room for 2 nights. The room 149 however is in an extension with insufficient heating. No heating in the corridors and this corner room has too small an electrical unit in the corner to deal with temperatures of 3 Celcius outside. An extension done on the cheap a while ago. The most galling thing is when I mentioned it to the receptionist they said 'hmm I know'. Lots of trainee's about, not impressed
-2; Stayed here as part of a business trip with some colleagues. The hotel is a strange layout and the hotel has an outwardly dated appearance. The room appeared utilitarian though clean but I had to open the window as the room was far to warm for me. The Bar area lacked any character and the beer selection was the usual high volume fizz type stuff. There were some bottled beers available. The restaurant appeared to be organised chaos, however the staff were pleasant. The food, when it arrived, was no more than average standard.  The really memorable bit was after retiring to bed I had to shut the window due to road noise but open it again later as the room was by far too hot to sleep. There appeared to be no control over the temperature in the room.  Breakfast is a self service buffet type affair but the presentation was not good and the fried eggs were cold.  All in all I was glad to be checking out and will not be returning. 
-2;" We had ordered a suite; in the event this turned into a not very spacious bedroom with a tiny alcove, into which they'd squeezed a second TV. Since there was no door separating the rooms, the whole thing was pointless. The ceilings were so low, you felt you ought to crawl around. The décor seemed reminiscent of a cheap, tacky bordello, with a ghastly fur thing on the bed. It was cold when we were staying there and the only way to heat up the room was to turn on one of those aircon/heating devices, which clattered all night, sometimes blowing out hot air and sometimes cold. Meanwhile, the bathroom only had a small towel rail for its heating; this wouldn't have been enough even if the windows had been shut: in the event one was jammed open and couldn't be closed. I had feared the worst as soon as we had entered the hotel and found a cramped reception area, with lowered ceilings (why?!) and loud pop music (again: why?!). There were other minor irritants. Perhaps we've been spoiled, but in recent years al the hotels we've stayed in have had hard flooring and it was difficult to adjust to having (dirty looking) carpets again. The (wobbly) tap over the sink had been installed so it was almost impossible to get a hand (or kettle) underneath it. We seemed to be staying beneath a herd of buffalo. Since this is unlikely, the sound insulation is terrible. I thought we had an intruder in our bathroom, until I discovered it was somebody in an adjacent bathroom. In the end I almost became used to hearing far too much information about what was happening in two adjacent bathrooms. Meanwhile, from outside was coming in the regular, deep thud, thud, thud from...? a bar? a disco? The hotel had provided ear plugs, but this seems to me to be a very cheap and rather impertinent was of providing sound insulation. "
-2;" We stayed as part of one four wedding parties over a weekend in one of the 40X rooms, which seem to have a reputation for being uncomfortably hot. Ours was. We were in a room above the smoking area, so suffered loud voices until at least 1am and we couldn't open the window to get fresh air and cool down because of the cigarette smoke. The windows are single glazed sash windows so didn't keep any of the noise out. The walls were so thin we could hear the conversation in the adjoining room, and when the singing in the shower started we knew when he got the words wrong. The glass door on the bathroom meant there was no privacy; the toilet was right opposite the door. Nice. The furniture layout was so cramped we couldn't open the wardrobe door properly and we couldn't move the bed as the headboard and lights were fixed. The carpets throughout were well worn. The main car park is to the rear and when they have a function on (at the weekends) you have to walk all the way around the hotel to the front to get in, there is no access from the rear except through the function rooms. Breakfast on Saturday was good, but on Sunday they seemed surprised that all those staying wanted breakfast. One slice of bacon instead of two and only half a breakfast mushroom instead of a whole one, then they ran out of some of the items on the menu. Very poor. The grounds and lake are lovely, the hotel is not. If you are going for a function stay at the Premier Inn and get a taxi. "
-2; Booked and paid hotel through lastminute.com. This was a mistake as I would not havepaid a penny to hotel on checkout. Breakfast facility very poor. But worst there was no water available to any room in the morning. We were going from hotel to our friends wedding and could not get washed or showered in hotel.No information or apology was given and they were also wanting me to pay for hotel although the money had come out my account through last minute. Would not recommend hotel or last minute particularly when booking hotels.Absolutely hopeless. 
-2; Good points staff v pleasant and excellent breakfast. Bad points Dated rooms, shower not working, no mobile phone reception which when reported was met with I know the whole area is poor. Not the staffs fault they were great but they dont warn you in brochure and clam to be a business/conference venue, Also no bar after 11.30 on sat night as was quiet 
-2;"They'd lost our booking, so rather than sort it, we were sent to &quot;The Business Centre&quot; to sort it ourselves&quot;.  When finally checked in, the hallway was littered by one room with packets of mouldy looking food.  The room was a good size, clean, but not without scribbling a in the info book and on the back of signs,  The food was disgraceful, thankfully only cheap. The drink prices at the bar were very acceptable.  Would return but take away ordered next time"
-2;" My wife, son and I met a friend of ours staying at the hotel and decided to eat dinner in the hotel restaurant (Jan 26, 2012). My review is based on the restaurant, not the hotel itself as my friend stated he liked the accomodations and we did get a tour (at night), to where the rooms looked very nice as well as the grounds. With a boat house and a lake on the property and with all the movies filmed there (a lot of horror movies), it maybe worth a night stay as the price didn't seem unfair. It is pretty far from downtown Windsor though, so you would have to take a cab to and from Windsor if you intend to do any type of shopping or travel into London via train. The restaraunt and reason for this review however was a bust for us. Service was decent, not great. The waiter didn't speak english very well. The restaraunt glasses weren't buffed so had water stains on them. It was a bit chilly in the restaurant too. There wasn't a salad on the menu, so I was able to order one from the bar menu. A plane dinner salad, nothing special; no complaints. I ordered the Venison at £32.00 a plate. This was just OK, not the greatest Venison I have ever eaten and was a little disappointing for the price. My wife and friend ordered two plates of the Ribeye for £32.00 a plate. The result was a very tough steak and not very well prepared in terms of taste, hardly worth the price. My son ordered the Mac and Cheese at £7.00 a bowl, and I would have to say it was the worst dish on the table, totally not touched. How hard is it to cook Mac & Cheese? I seriously considered going into the kitchen and teaching the chef how to cook, all the main entrees were below par and for the price, what a bummer! We ordered two bottles of water for the table at £4.00 a bottle, some veggies at £3.75 a dish (which were good), a bottle of Chateau Cotes red at £32.00 a bottle, a couple of desserts and a £4.50 cup of coffee (£4.50 for a cup of coffee, really??!!!!) which resulted in a shocker of a bill considering the poor quality of food and not so great service. Total bill: £167.25 and that did not include service / or a tip. I would never return to have dinner there... to fill out the rest of the form about the hotel, I am basing this on my friends description... "
-2; My recent experience at this hotel was my worst hotel experience, & I have stayed at quite a few Crowne Plazas. It was the lowest place I have ever stayed in. The male hotel reception staff were very welcoming and friendly, and one female reception staff was extremely cold and unhelpful ( I am not referring to the black female receptionist). The room was outdated and scruffy. The bathroom was desperately in need of a good steam clean and re-grouting. There was a pipe/banging noise going on all night in a storage room next door. The evening restaurant staff were apparently not em-powered, as all queries had to be referred to management. What sort of restaurant runs out of a specific steak by 8pm on a Sat evening. I found this hotel depressing and cold. I would never ever recommend it to anyone or come back again. The car park charge is a real rip off particularly as the hotel owns it. 
-2;" I have recently stayed at this hotel while on a business trip. I was disappointed by the hotel, from the outside it looks like a block of council buildings. The room was also very basic. In regards to the dining facilities; the restaurant was ok, I went on a Wednesday when they have a set buffet. There is also a bar downstairs which plays love football. The hotel grounds were lovely and the staff were very friendly  I wouldn't stay here again "
-2;" I've stayed at MyHotel Brighton on about 12 occasions as I work down here. In summary the hotel and its rooms are very cool minimalist design. However, if you plan to sleep before midnight, be aware that the rooms can be very noisy due to the bars in the street outside. Also the white roller blinds in the rooms do not block out light so the room can be flooded with streetlight and a lie-in is impossible, particularly in summer. Eye masks and ear plugs are provided on request. Breakfast is now continental - you even have to get your own coffee. Cooked breakfast - eg scrambled eggs is extra and portions are measly; I was assured there were two eggs in the tiny portion in the middle of my plate. It's a very cool hotel and the staff seem more interested in talking to each other than serving customers, I've had that experience on several occasions and will no longer be staying at the hotel. The Grand is more chintzy but the service more than substitutes for style. "
-2; Stayed at the Hilton Gatwick for 1 night as we missed our flight , Paid £258 for 3 adults in one room, Breakfast included. Very Shocked at the standard of the room for the Hilton name and price . One good point is the breakfast Vast selection , hot and very tasty . But thats as good as it gets . Our room 3060 . All the landings are very dirty with dirt and mess in corner of door ways , Scuff marks and dirty stains all along the corridors The Carpets not very clean . And for a none smoking hotel our room smelt of smoke .The room had 3 double beds , But they needed replacing as the mattress rolled from one side to another ,two very old fashioned air chairs in room . Inside our room on the ceiling was a very large brown water stain mark on one of the tiles . The room had black mould marks around the room and the pictures had dust on the top of frames. For the price and the Hilton Name we would not use this Hotel again 
-2;"Stayed here for the weekend with my wife.  At check in Reception Staff a little inefficient but friendly enough. Room was quite small and storage for clothes limited. Bed was very comfortable...the best bit of the stay. Car park is small and also about a 200 yard walk away...not good when there's a gale blowing down Chapel Street.  Went out to see friends on Friday so no experience of the restaurants etc.  We made up for this on the Saturday night. OMG!!!  Booked a table in the restaurant for 4 people at 9pm. Went to the main restaurant and it had been taken over by a very noisy function. Had arranged to meet our friends in the Bar. This also taken over by a function to the exclusion of hotel guests.  We were directed to the restaurant on the 2nd floor and told there was a &quot;bar&quot; opposite the restaurant door. I use the term bar very loosely. This was a room with about 4 sets of tables and chairs. A tressle table with a couple of ice buckets containing some San Miguel and a barrel of beer with a tap. There was a fridge with mixers in and a selection of spirits which I can put to shame with what I have in my kitchen cupboard.!!  We decided not to stay. We went out to a local bar and came back for our meal later.  The waiter in the restaurant was very over worked but was cheery and a credit to himself. The food was ordered. My wife ordered Singapore Noodles (allegedly spicy) and king prawns. She was a little disappointed when there were no prawns in her meal. The pleasant waiter took her meal back and it duly arrived with prawns. He apologised profusely. These were not King Prawns they were the little cocktail prawns that you get in a prawn cocktail...not impressed.  We complained to the Reception staff about the fiasco of bar and restaurants and his response was an apologetic &quot;It's nearly Christmas&quot;. I mentioned that at £95 per night I had expected better. This wasn't met with any comment.  I would suggest that as Liverpool has a lot of 4/5 star hotels you try them and only use this one as a last resort. Do not come anytime in December as &quot;it's nearly Christmas&quot; and don't eat in the restaurant or drink in the bar!!  The icing on the cake (not Christmas) had to be the drunken man sleeping on the 4th Floor corridor who we had to step over to get to the lift when leaving the hotel.   I certainly will not be back"
-2; The rooms are dirty, I stayed here for just over a month in total on week days for business. I was in 4 - 5 different rooms in total and each one was as bad as the others. The rooms had random brown drip marks and splats on the tiles, the mugs and glasses are just rinsed out as I found some lipstick on one of the mugs. The furniture is battered and old, really needs replacing, mini fridge smells dreadful. Rotting wood, and hairs in the bed sheets.  The restaurant food was not good, it was bland and oily. One of the waiters was very rude and everything was overpriced and poor quality, as if everything was frozen food.  I would not stay here again unless I really had to. The ONLY good thing about this hotel is that the reception staff were really lovely and helpful. 
-2; Hotel is under long term refurbishment. Should not be open to paying customers until it is finished. Room was poorly heated and dated. Kept awake throughout the night by many police and ambulance sirens (nearby hospital) No warning to us on website of large scale refurbishment in operation. Excellent breakfast was the only positive 
-2; Stayed here for a night in the week, luckily we had a large discount through our health insurance otherwise we would of really kicked up a stink. Holiday Inn quality rooms, a poor holiday inn at that. Missing fixtures, flickering lights, no air con and just a generally dated feel.  The restaurant staff and food were really nice and we would return just for that. Steak was perfect but I must say I ordered a fig and yoghurt dessert but you would see more yoghurt on the lid of a muller corner, explains the low calorie count.   Spa facilities were great but extremely small, if you were staying as a group I would look elsewhere as none of the facilities could comfortably fit more than 3-4 people at a time. You basically queue up in couples ready to pounce into the steam or snow room. Strangely a 10 person sauna is situated on the otherside of the leisure centre quality pool. I can't imagine how busy it gets on a weekend!   I wouldn't let it put me off the Champneys brand but I will steer clear of this branch.  
-2; The visit to the restaurant was yet again appalling, it was not busy and we was offered no wine list and we was told my the waiter that he didn't speak much English but still didn't offer to get us anyone to serve us then he removed our wine and water glasses but even though there was a restaurant manager he didn't seem to care. We had our starter of fishcakes and there was a large bone in my partners one and we complained to the manager and he just said fish have bones laughed and walked away. The pork I had for main course was very cold it looked good but not good as I would have asked for a salad, even the diane sauce was not made properly as I am a chef and this was made with a very dark sauce ( gravy like) with mushrooms with no alcohol in a word very bad and after leaving half of my meal still no one asked me if everything was ok with our main course. 
-2; I would choose to stay here on the hottest July day in English history. Kingsize Executive room was pretty standard. Clean and plenty of room. However.... No air conditioning, so room was stiflingly hot. The hotel very kindly provided a wee fan which was like having a old man breathing on you...... no fear, open the window to let some air in....sadly I was on the M1 side of the hotel so the road noise was loud. Close the window, no problem with noise but unbearable heat. Ordered room service. Took an hour to arrive which is slow in my books 
-2; The hotel is ok, maybe a little tired looking but the food was good. Selection of beer at the bar was terrible. Aside from the usual mass produced offerings there was one craft ale in a bottle.  The bed was by far the worst I have experienced for a long time. It sounded like a barrage attack whenever you moved and had springs about to break through to add to the discomfort. In fact it was so old they had put a mattress topper on. Not what you expect from a Hilton hotel.  Aside from that the hotel is set in lovely grounds with a golf course. 
-2; Let's start off with the good: the breakfast buffet is as good as any I've been to, with the a la carte options including eggs benedict with spinach and hollandaise sauce a particular delight.  That's it.  The rooms were dirty and in poor condition, and I didn't even want to touch the tv and remote control such was the decrepidness of these 'facilities'. The gym is a 50 minute walk away from the hotel- a joke! And if you think you can get a space in the limited car park, guess again.  Do not stay here. 
-2;" Stunning hotel. You'll read that often times in the reviews here on TripAdvisor, and it is. The presentation and quality of the rooms and communal areas is just that, stunning. Not convinced our room had enough lighting mind!  But Titanic do have work to do. During our stay, most of our touch points with the staff ranged from inattentive to pure and simple rudeness. For us that simply did not &quot;cut the mustard&quot; for what is a 4 star hotel. It would be worthwhile management taking note.  2/5 is the very best we can do. We'll revisit in a year or so and see if that can be improved but who knows? "
-2; I visited the Oxford for the 2nd time in a year, the first time being about 10 months ago whilst it was still part of the Barcelo group. I attended an Open Univeristy MBA tutorial at the hotel. The first time, I was pleasantly surprise by the quality of the buffet lunch, and the good service we received. The 2nd time however, more recently and since it had been taken over by Puma hotels, it was absolutely dire. On arrival, the coffee machine was broken. In addition, there were no morning snacks that they had previously provided (people travelling miles from all over the country). When I finally managed to find someone to help, the gentleman, although friendly, brought over a flask of coffee. I drink my coffee white, however I have never seen milk turn coffee grey! needless to say, I left it! Eventually the coffee machine worked for 5 minutes and then broke again, at least I managed to get some cafeen unlike some of my fellow students. Lunch was appaulling, terrible excuse for a buffet lunch. A few sandwiches (I could not tell if my filling was chicken or fish, seriously!!!) and a bowl of crisps, unlike the excellent buffet we had received last time.... And to make matters worse... 4 hours later at 4pm, all the leftovers and dirty plates were still left in the coffee area where the lunch had been served. Nobody had been bothered to come and clear up. Puma hotels, what are you doing?! We were a group of 20 or so MBA students, all business professionals, representing a large proportion of UK companies, possibly future business, and we are treated like rats... shame on you! Do not book a meeting or conference here, they are incapable of providing even the most basic service.... money would be better well spent at a premier inn! I cannot comment on the rooms. 
-2; we have not been here for a long time and thought we would give it a try.My food came up cold,I returned it and it came back warm despite the waitress warning that the plate was very hot.Not a great vegetarian option,none on the specials.We live fairly locally but I will not be going back. 
-2; First of all this hotel is not your typical Hilton. It's an attractive old building with ugly more moderns bits built onto it but that's only a minor thing. The management seem to be operating a skeleton staff policy but the effect of that is a slow poor service. Either that or the staff are just very slow. I ordered food in the bar area which was pretty quiet. It still took an hour for my food to arrive by which time all the others had finished eating. It's annoying to be told it will be two minutes and fifteen minutes later you are still waiting. The following evening I thought I would order something simple for them to make so ordered a sandwich. That took 50 minutes and again all the others who I had dinner with had finished eating. The food was brought to our table one meal at a time often with long gaps between.  On checkout they had miraculously added over £100 per night extra to the agreed rate which they promptly corrected. The pool is small and an odd shape. The gym is in a long thin conservatory. The running machine I used had something loose on it and made a hell of a racket, so I stopped so as not to annoy everyone in the gym. The restaurant is nice and the rooms ok. The location means they have a captive audience unless you want to go out somewhere in the car to eat each evening.  I would reluctantly stay here again but only if nothing else was available in the area. 
-2;" We've had some good meals over the years in the restaurant of this hotel, which is very close to our home. The food is basic but has normally been quite satisfactory  Last night was not a good experience despite it being quiet in the hotel and restaurant.  My first two choices were off the menu because &quot;It was being changed later in the week&quot;..  We ordered scampi, chips and peas and a chicken curry. Basic food that even a decent trainee chef should easily be able to prepare. Unfortunately, the cook (and I use the term very loosely) was having a bad night and getting these simple dishes right was were beyond him/her  Some of the scampi was undercooked, with soggy crumb coating. The peas had seen better days and remained untouched by my wife.   The curry was just about warm enough to eat and a very dry poppadum accompanying it had been cooked by microwaving. One part was not cooked at all and another part was burned. The curry hadn't been in the microwave long enough and the poppadum too long!  The response from two of the staff was bored interest and weak apology as we paid the bill. They also seemed a bit miffed that we didn't leave a tip. Maybe we should have taken it further, but after a long heavy day we were too tired to make a fuss. We decided to cut our losses.  We won't be going back. "
-2;" Minimalist in design with spacious rooms being a former warehouse ... the hotel is OK and well-placed for travel being near Piccadilly Station.  However, the rstaurant is an area to steer clear off .. it is overpriced with poor choice and miniscule portions. Wine is about £25 75cl.bottle.  I can not understand why overpriced restaurants like this seem to regard vegetables like gold ... two Mangetouts and two small pieces of carrot does NOT constitute a vegetable accompaniment .. similarly three small pieces of rhubabrb arranged artistically on a slate (and cold as well) with a 2&quot; x 2&quot; piece of crumble and a spoonful of custard can scarcely be described as Rhubarb Crumble unless you rae blind or have a vivis imagination.  Breakfast was good but overpriced at £14 ... there are numerous cafes/ reaturants in the immediate area with 24 hr foodshops as well ... use these for considerably better value. "
-2; My wife and I stayed overnight at the hotel last weekend as we were dining in the Sindhu restaurant. The room we had was small, but that was our fault for booking a Standard Room, however regardless, the hotel overall is looking tired and needs refurbishment. The worst part of our experience here was breakfast, which was terrible, both in terms of quality and service. We waited 40 minutes before we could get someone to take our order, despite asking a waitress twice, each time being told she would get the person who took the orders! I eventually ordered their full cooked breakfast with poached eggs. What I got was a, singular, cold hard cooked poached egg, a mushroom that was so over cooked it had dehydrated and black pudding that was barely cooked and came out soft, not crispy. Furthermore, there wasn't a potatoe scone, but rather the worlds smallest piece of fried bread and so on. But the real annoyance was that my wife ordered smoked haddock with poached egg. What she got was a very small piece of luke warm fish and yes, you guessed it, a cold hard yoked poached egg. For this dish they had the audacity to charge a surcharge of £2.75 over and above the published breakfast rate of £19.95. This was both poor quality and very poor value. I have no problem paying extra for anything but this was disgraceful.  I have stayed at many hotels in this group and have always had a pleasant experience, in particular, their breakfast which at one time they were renowned for. Sadly we will not use the Compleat Angler again nor would I recommend it. 
-2; I booked the Bedruthan during Half Term as a Birthday treat for my girlfriend. I was aware that the Bedruthan was a 'family hotel' but it's location, it's new restaurant and the views swayed my decision. The property is not the most alluring but somewhere, someone will no doubt find it charming. I started to get concerned on arrival when I was greeted with a slightly dank smell in the lobby and noticed that everything appeared a little tatty. (Certainly the carpets..) We went for a look around while our room was readied (as we were early..). Two of the adult only zones (The new restaurant and the Quiet Room) both had children in them. We were not too fussed but we started to get the feeling from the looks we were getting that we had clearly forgotten something (..kids perhaps ??). The hotel was alas a bit jaded and tatty. I think if you are desperate for a break and for the kids to be taken off your hands, after a torturous time on the motorway then perhaps you overlook the underlying condition of the place ? We decided to tough it out and were shown to our room which indeed had the two simple requirements in a King Size bed and a lovely view of the ocean. Alas the view was across a flat roof outside which again was very jaded and tatty looking. We had a baby monitor/intercom from the 1960/70s hanging off the wall. My partner pulled the bed covers back and recoiled. As did I when I could see that there was a considerable amount of both head and 'body' hair in the bed. When the sheets came back further the bed cover was horribly stained with God knows what. No. I will not put up with that in any establishment and certainly not one pretending to be a 4* property. Sadly I had to return to reception to complain because the phone in the room was broken.   Mandy from reception was very helpful and apologetic and tried to find us another room while we went for a drink. In the Wild Cafe we were the only people there and outnumbered by staff but it still took 5 minutes for someone to serve us. Eek.   We were shown to a 'family' room on a higher floor with an equally impressive view but alas it came with two made up cot beds which could not be removed. There were no chairs so the beds would have to be seats. No. Not really what we booked. Mandy the hotel's only redeeming factor, did try to find us another room. She offered us a family apartment/suite just away from the main building. It was nicely furnished but the bedroom was at the rear and had an alley next to it. With the curtains closed for privacy it was very dark alas. The small living area overlooked the sea but it also overlooked the World's tiredest looking tennis court, then used as parking space for some local trades working at the hotel. There were French Windows out to a jaded patio with a couple of loungers but it was very overlooked.   We did agonise over what to do as it wasn't what we had booked and it was Friday afternoon at about 430pm. It is a long way to Cornwall to find yourself in this position. I'm glad that we did not accept compromise. Hat's off to those that have 'marketed' the hotel because the vagueries of the website do cover up some of it's obvious shortcomings.   The hotel needs some urgent investment to improve the facade, the carpets, the aging rooms. A few brightly covered sofas and some 'dressing up' do not make up for the tatty carpets and general disrepair.   A Housekeeping manager or the Front Office Manager needs to check each room individually to ensure they are ready for guests. Not only did the previous guest leave enough hair to fashion a small Wig but the hotel left his keycard pouch on the dressing table. It gave us that extra personal touch that at least we knew who he was. Stained bed linen is simply not acceptable at all !! There is no way on our verdant planet that that sort of experience is worth £240 per night !!   Luckily when it looked like we were heading back to London in tears, a weekend and Birthday ruined we found that the Hotel Tresanton in St Mawes had some cancellations due to the weather. For £245 a night we enjoyed luxury, fantastic service in one of their smaller rooms. King Size bed, sea view, oppulent, seperate bathroom and toilet. The two experiences were lightyears apart. Thanks to Mandy for trying but no thanks to the Bedruthan Steps. Alas the whole debacle has made me now want to avoid their sister hotel the Scarlet. Would I eat in Herring having seen the state of the bed upstairs ? Alas... 
-2; was put up as a result of cancelled flight so did nt have to pay for the experience. Good points...buffet put on for fellow passengers was quite good, range of food and veggie options. bad points, bars were understaffed, no wifi in rooms, bottle of cheap wine nearly 30 pounds, beds had duvet like nonsense under the cover sheet.  Would never staf in this hotel by choice. Went to Gatwisk traveldoge a few weeks later - it was better. 
-2; We came to stay at the hotel after a hectic few days to relax over the bank holiday weekend.  For a modern hotel we were stunned that the hotel did not hav air con. This led to 2 warm and uncomfortable nights stay,  On the first night we both slept very badly due to the softness of the bed. I normally like soft beds but this was crazy, if one of us moved during the night, the bed would start to wobble and the other one would feel it.  The next morning we spoke to reception and after much dithering and causing us quite a bit of stress and wasting our time. They offered us a free upgrade, which was nice and the new room had much better bed.  We ordered in room breakfast on both mornings. Several items did not arrive on the 1st morninxg and On the 2nd morning we ordered room service breakfast but it never arrived. After chasing this up through reception it arrived quickly.  To sum up the hotel should be great, it just feels that a few things could do with fine tuning. 
-2; Checked in OK. Room was reasonable although a little small. Breakfast good with friendly staff. Bed and pillows extremely uncomfortable.  Checkout by staff member Sandra was abysmal.... Not that desk, this one. Then not that one, you need to come to this one. You need to hand over your credit card even though it was pre paid through Expedia.  She seemed to get upset when i challenged her and then spent 5 minutes tapping buttons on a computer finishing with an OK.  Sandra needs to stop speaking to guests as though they are her children, own up to making a mistake, ask how the stay was and learn basic manners. Thank you, Goodbye etc etc.  I won't be going back and i suggest everyone questions why they are asking for their credit card before handing it over. 
-2;" Our weekend at Frimley Hall was fun, but not in all the traditional ways.  We got the room off Secret Escapes so it's probably partly their fault for misadvertising, but we didn't expect our room to look quite as much like a retirement home from the pictures advertised. We asked politely if we could change, and were shown two more rooms that were largely identical, but which were considered &quot;free upgrades&quot; because they had a velour chair or an actual shower. It was all slightly embarrassing, and very Fawlty Towers, to be marched around a hotel while the staff member pointed at curtains or tables and asked us if they were more satisfying to us.  It seemed the entire hotel was rammed full of either wedding parties or works Christmas functions for the whole weekend. That meant that we couldn't get any spa treatment or eat in the restaurant at all for our entire stay. We were reprimanded for not booking ahead for these which is sort of fair enough, but as we hadn't come in a car it was quite annoying to have to keep catching pricey taxis to restaurants.  At one point, after spending the first night eating room service like social outcasts, we were told the hotel would lay on a free taxi to a local Italian restaurant the next day. The staff member and (possibly) the manager could then be heard arguing next to the phone for a full three minutes or so before the staff member came back on and said there would be no free taxi after all.  On the Saturday morning we waited 45 minutes in the breakfast room for a cooked breakfast. One of the waiting staff explained there was only one chef to prepare breakfast for what seemed a full hotel. The man next to us was going nuts about his &quot;disgusting&quot; black pudding and at one point called the hapless restaurant manager over to point out a hair in his scrambled egg. That night, a note arrived in our room informing us we were strongly advised to order breakfast in bed the next day, which presumably was a coping mechanism put in place by the overburdened chef.  The pool and sauna were great fun, but beware you have to cross a car park, in the cold and in the dark, to get to it, as well as pushing through parties of wedding guests in the lobby who will look distastefully at you in your robe and slippers.  Frimley Hall is basically a bit crazy. The staff are all passionate about doing their jobs, but are clearly overworked by some seriously dodgy management decisions to fill this 'relaxing' spa hotel with as many get rich quick schemes as possible while weekend breaks have to work around them. All this nonsense made us smile, but not everybody is as easily amused as we are.  Pack a sense of humour as a well as a bathing suit, and don't expect anything close to a four-star hotel experience. If you're looking to be pampered, book everything ahead and try not to coincide with a wedding or Christmas!  Or just go somewhere else.      "
-2;" We were part of a NADFAS party, there for 4 nights. The hotel is well located for our planned visits to; York Minster, Castle Howard, Harewood Hall & Harlow Carr gardens. That is where the best bit ends! Whilst the breakfast was acceptable, the pre-booked evening meals were a farce. It soon became clear that &quot;Coach parties&quot; are considered as lesser mortals, to be given inferior and badly cooked meals, from a limited and oft-repeated menu (same dishes, different names), with slow service by poorly trained staff. The service in the bar was very slow and twice they ran out of gin & tonics. The place appeared to be run on a shoe string and very short staffed. Our room was fine but we heard horror stories from fellow guests; blocked loo, light admitting blinds, mezzanine bedrooms unsuitable for elderly people with stairs difficulties, etc. Staff appeared to be indifferent and poorly trained. getting wine with dinner proved almost impossible at first, thought it improved as the week went on. We will not return "
-2; After spending the day here for a friends wedding and reception we booked a block of rooms in advance, because of the wedding package we managed to negotiate a deal on 15 double rooms, when we came to check in the manager and all the staff had no idea about anything even tho we had the conformation emails and demented we payed all of it, after a hour and a half of sorting that we then went to our room ( having to go down a flight of stairs to go back up) and it was covered in dust and the bathroom looked like it hasn't been cleaned in about a year! After we got past this we decided to go for a drink before the reception but only to find we had to wait 30 minutes to be served at the bar! And there was only one member of staff serving!  When we went to the reception we were disgusted to find that all of our glasses from the mornings activities were still lying around collecting wasps and they were in no rush to do anything about it, 
-2; As you drive onto the hotel grounds you can see that the whole set up is in desperate need of refurbishment. To be fair, the facilities are good for younger children with a small indoor pool, a soft play area and outdoor climbing frame. However, there are very few staff working at the hotel and the whole place is run down and rather tatty. The dining room is the worst, being very drab and not particularly warm so you just want to have your meal as quickly as you can and get out. The food for adults was actually quite good but the kids meals can be a bit salty with poor desserts. Overall, the Old Park Hotel does not offer value for money and will leave you feeling disappointed with your choice. 
-2; A group of us totalling around 16 booked lunch at the restaurant in this hotel. There is an adjoining pay and display car park that leads directly to the hotel across a small courtyard. None of us were staying overnight.There is a pleasant bar and lounge where you can get drinks and wait until your table is ready. It was disappointing to find that our party had been divided onto two tables. This seemed to have occurred because although our booking had been made well in advance, other large tables had already been taken. The lunch is a buffet and was clearly running low and not being promptly replenished. This was a consistent problem throughout all three courses. The baked potatoes were well past their best and actually tasted old and reheated. The Carvery was running low on meat and the chef was doing his best to make what was left go round. This really was not a good dining experience and although the staff were pleasant enough it is unlikely we will return, which is unfortunate as we have been meeting here for several years. If you are planning to go to this restaurant as a group, it would seem advisable from this experience that you book an early time slot to avoid a similar situation occurring. We had a 1.30pm booking. 
-2; A hotel that has seen better days.   The flush on the toilet barely worked, the bin in the bathroom was broken and the tiling was chipped in places.  I have stayed in better overall facilities for less money. 
-2; We stayed here unexpectedly after a flight was delayed, and at the airline's expense. Have not stayed in Hilton brand for many years, and whilst it got us and easyJet out of a hole, on this occasion, overall, I was very disappointed that their business model has not moved with the market and the competition. The staff were very good and professional, but the hotel overall is tired and very 1980's. Drinks, food etc. were frightfully expensive, and very poor value, and Wi-Fi access cost an outrageous £14.99 PER DAY!!!   Bearing in mind that most guests will only stay here for one night, I cannot understand why anyone would pay two or three times the price to stay here, plus a massive premium on meals and drinks, other than through 'brand snobbery' rather than the Hampton or Premier Inn, which are also integral to the airport terminals. 
-2;" The restaurant is an absolute disgrace. At breakfast it was difficult to find a table. There were plenty of empty ones but they had not been cleared. When I did eventually find what I thought was a clean table it soon became apparent that what I thought was clean and what you staff feel is clean are very different things. There were cup marks on the table (still wet) and the napkin that had the clean cutlery on it was dirty (used) and torn. The mugs for use with the coffee machine were not washed properly; they all had stains in them. The chairs in the restaurant are stained. It’s not a pleasant environment. I also ate in the restaurant on the previous evening. The food was adequate but again, the cleanliness and staff attitude left a lot to be desired. The tables are not cleaned properly. They have slate table mats on the tables but when I lifted the mat up to move it there was food beneath it. Disgusting, and nowhere near deserving of the four stars the hotel has. "
-2; We spent two nights here around a family wedding outside Liverpool, so we didn't spend a great deal of time in the hotel itself, and didn't use the eating and drinking facilities at all, for example.  On the surface, this looks like the kind of place that would be right up our street, and first impressions were good - the public spaces are light and open and minimalist, and the room was a nice one.  But a number of odd little quirks made us realise that the detail was missing in a lot of areas.  Parking in a separate lot isn't unheard of in a city centre hotel, but having to wait for a member of staff to come out and walk to unlock the car park is just crazy, and on one occasion took ages late at night. There has to be a better system than this.  The room was weirdly cold and seemed impossible to get warm, even in the middle of a hot summer. It felt like there was a constant draft, though we couldn't work out where it was coming from. The bed was comfortable, though the pillows were flat as pancakes, and no extras were available in the room. A request for extras at reception was never followed through.  The bathroom was the biggest triumph of style over substance though. The bath was on the opposite side of the room from the only rail, and there were no hooks anywhere else in the room. On the other side of the room, the shower was wholly open on one side, meaning the entire floor ended up covered in water, which wasn't very pleasant to walk into in my socks just before leaving for the day. Far worse though, is the fact that a wooden skirting board extends round the room right up to the edge of the 'cubicle', and the wood had started to rot very visibly from all the water escaping from the shower. That's the kind of design detail that I think most people would spot being a problem at the planning stage, surely.  Overall, for a pretty expensive rate, we'd have expected greater attention to detail, and, in the matter of the pillows, a more responsive staff. 
-2; I treated my husband to a trip to Old Trafford for his birthday. I bought a package, which included an overnight stay, through Skelton. As we have both had over 65 birthdays already, I was happy to pay over the odds for a comfortable stay, and it was a special occasion. I was delighted, therefore, when I received confirmation that the hotel was a Copthorne. We are seasoned travellers and have always found this chain to be one that offers a good standard of customer care. I was a bit taken aback, therefore, when we arrived at 1.50 p.m. and were told by a receptionist who was sitting doing nothing that she was not supposed to check us in until 2.00 p.m. We were happy to wait and she became more friendly when we asked her if she had a map of the city. By the time I had signed forms and given my credit card it was well past 2.00 p.m. We asked if it was possible to exchange our twin sharing room for a double but she explained that the hotel was fully booked. At first I thought our room was small but adequate. Then we discovered that the toilet did not flush without a vigorous and prolonged amount of handle pumping. As the hotel was fully booked we knew it would be pointless asking to move rooms. Considering that the majority of the clientele were football supporters (like ourselves) we had a reasonable (though not entirely quiet) night's sleep. When I tried to run a bath the following morning I discovered that barely a trickle of water would come from the cold tap. It took nearly 25 mins to fill to a bearable temperature. By now the garish mis-match of colours on the bathroom walls was also beginning to irritate me.  We sat in a lovely conservatory overlooking the water for breakfast. I went to get some cereal and found small crumb-sized specks of food sticking to each of the bowls at the top of the three stacks of dishes. I removed one and rejected another before I found one clean enough to eat out of. Then I happened to glance at the stack of plates nearby. Green food looking like streaks of cabbage was welded to the top one and I could see that people had rejected others, leaving them scattered about. In other Copthorne hotels we have always found the breakfast buffet inviting with plenty of choice. Here it was very limited, especially in choice of fruit. Prepared to believe I had been unlucky with the dishes, I went for a glass for juice. It felt gritty on the outside. Now I was beginning to wonder if I should eat or drink anything at all. My husband went to get a cooked breakfast. Once again the top plate was less than clean - grease marked, in fact. He ate it but told me the following day that it was not very warm. He was, in fact, comparing it with his breakfast at the Travelodge in the middle of the city, where we stayed the following night. We had expected this hotel to be noisy, basic and impersonal. In fact, it was friendly, superbly clean and better quality in every way. I even had an e-mail from them today asking me to give feedback on my stay - something which I am quite sure the Copthorne would not risk doing. It is a great shame because this one bad experience will make me less confident about using the chain again, although our local one in Cardiff is excellent. 
-2; We booked 2 rooms to attend a wedding. On the positive side the room and bathroom are large. On the negative side even though the rooms had been booked months in advance, our rooms where on separate floors. Our room although tired, was clean, we had to request an iron and the air conditioning was faulty, the room became so hot it was difficult to sleep(Other guest also reported very hot rooms). The room our daughters had: was dirty, there was dust, cobwebs and dirty cups in the room. there was only one towel provided. A complaint at the reception desk led to the offer of a visit from housekeeping to clean the room. The room was polished but the dirty cups remained! In the bar the prices are expensive and the service was inept, a simple drinks order was incorrect on 3 attempts. A glass of wine was knocked across the bar onto my husband and another guest, who managed to avoid being soaked due to there prompt reactions, the waitress made no attempt to clean up the mess, this was done by the two guests. This was highlighted to the reception staff who explained that they had a new member of bar staff. We where told that someone would speak to us when we checked out the next morning, this did not happen. We did not make a fuss at this time to avoid upsetting the wedding party. Breakfast the next morning was confusing, a buffet had been laid out in one of the function rooms, there was a minimal amount of chairs/table space. However we had to ask for juice, toast, hot water and milk, as none where available on the buffet. We asked for eggs for the cooked breakfast and where advised that they had no eggs! Whilst we acknowledge that we had a special room rate as we had attended the wedding, We expected better from a MacDonald Hotel, as we have stayed at MacDonald Hotels previously and found them to be very good. 
-2;Arrived with 24 golfers for an overnight stay and two rounds of golf. The golf courses were good and the hotel rooms themselves were clean and comfortable. There unfortunately the good news stops. The staff at the golf bar (Claret Jug) were undermanned and under trained - which is a shock because at the prices they charge for food and drinks you would have thought they would have wanted to serve as many people as possible. Trips to the bar took over twenty minutes to be served, the 20% discount we were offered for food and drink was sometimes applied sometimes not - and chicken wings at £8 for three of the smallest wings possible was incredibly overpriced. We sat down to a set meal - some of the golfers asked for the pie - were informed it was mince pies - and proceeded to eat chicken pie. The whole place is a shambles. As someone who runs his own business this place is completely mismanaged!!!!
-2; We arrived early and sat in the garden for two hours even though our rooms were ready, nobody came to us or welcomed us. We got the bargain deal and the bargain rooms at the top of the hotel and there is no lift. The room was clean but had a constant drone the cold tap would not turn on and the shower was either boiling or freezing. The mattress was so soft we could not get comfortable. Looks good but does not deliver. 
-2; The Crown is a nice hotel, but we felt the room rates were expensive! If they had been £150 per night that would have been reasonable value. The service in the restaurant at dinner was poor, another tables starters were brought to us within 1 minute of taking our order! The waiter had no clue how to pour wine!  However breakfast was truly a sham. We waited 55 mins for ours to arrive, they kept forgetting the toast, the coffee, in fact it got to a stage where it was so bad it was hilarious!! Adnams need to sort it out and quick! We will not be back. 
-2;" There is a plaque at the entrance suggesting this hotel is recommended by the Johansens guide. I would rate this hotel as a poor 3 star hotel lacking management and requiring significant investment to bring it up to an acceptable standard. The television is restricted to three channels. The central heating has two options; on with a terrible racket or off and cold. The food was poor. "
-2; I have visited The Worlds End quite a few times, has usually been good. The food is of a good quality and the staff are friendly and helpful. Last night was an exception to this. The food was excellent but it took 90 minutes to arrive because the chef lost the docket. This was unnoticed until the issue was raised after 90 minutes. By the time it arrived at 9.40, my appetite had past. I also found it a bit pricey compared to comparative venues. I'm unlikely to return in a hurry. 
-2; When we booked the hotel via Last Minute it said on the booking description that massages would be included with no additional costs. When we got there this wasn't the case. Massages needed to be booked in advance and paid for.   Then the shower didn't work in our room. The shower head was very dated and only a trickle of water would come out. They gave us a another room to shower in.   Then we it came to the evening we went down to reception and asked if they could recommend any restaurants to go eat. The hotel is 5min walking distance from centre of town, and I said we could get a taxi if needed, so they had a pretty big choice. First they recommended the Harvester down the road, which we said we weren't really interested in. Then they recommended to me and my girlfriend Weatherspoons in town. I found this rude and shocking that a 4* hotel would recommend somewhere where you get 2 meals for £5.   I complained to the general manager after the stay. They have got Lastminute to change their booking description. They also said they would make sure all the front of house staff would be trained on the area so they can offer better advice.   What they have offered me as compensation is 20% off another stay and 20% off a massage. However, you can get this offer online from their website at the moment, so really they have offered me nothing, which I think shows how they feel about their customers...they obviously don't care and thought they would try to get more money out of me.   So in all nice hotel but Hallmark aren't a brand that care about customer loyalty and service. 
-2; “Noisy and small rooms” Reviewed yesterday NEW We stayed in room 31 which was on the main corridor and very noisy, we could hear people walking up and down and chatting all evening, which woke us up at least 4 times through the evening, including at 2.30am! We complained and were moved to another room away from the people flight path to the spa, however, the air conditioning in the new room was faulty and was extremely loud, so we had to switch it off to try and get some sleep. Finally, after two nights of disturbed sleep we were woken up with a fire alarm test, which is set for 9am every Monday morning. Very disappointing stay, when we gave the feedback to the staff on reception when leaving, they just smiled and said sorry......., while taking our payment!! 
0; We stay at this hotel every year for a mini spa break. The hotel remains a great place to stay and the staff are fantastic, but frankly the spa area of the pool and hot tub is in a disgusting state with peeling paint and just feels grubby. It hasn't had a lick of paint in the four years I have been visiting and I won't be coming back until they sort it. They are currently renovating the whole hotel which is great, but frankly it would take them a day to reprint the pool area and make it 100 times better. 
0; This Hotel is great to stay in before an early flight as you are often able to check your cases in the night before and go straight to security in the morning. You do not have to go outside at all unless you have to park your car.  The Hotel is quite expensive and rooms are a little scruffy and in need of a bit of refurbishment. Maybe it is because it is an airport Hotel but it also felt a little bit impersonal, with able but not over-friendly staff. I would stay here again but more for the convenience than any other factor. 
0;" I wasnt to sure about booking the Brandon after staying at the Mcdonalds hotel in Ansty and the Coombe Abbey previously, both are nearby. Stayed for one night, the hotel is set in beautiful grounds, the character of the building has been maintained. The staff were very friendly, the room was very clean and a good size. The prices in the bar were a little high but then they do have overheads. This is where the niceties stop.....The room was like a sauna which meant a sleepless night, £110 per night with no AC is criminal. When I eventually checked out the receptionist said &quot;that will be £10 for the breakfast sir&quot;  WHAT!!! £110 per night and another tenner for breakfast I think I'm being very generous by giving 3/5 Stay at one of the other hotels mentioned,get the same service in the same location and save yourself £30,  F "
0; Anniversary treat. Stayed 2 nights. Room was at back with niceish view of hillside. Room OK. Rather noisy during silent hours with noise from annex/pub fans and also birds that seemed to be in loft. When paying a lot of money I would expect better. Staff great. Food fine,although cooked breakfast could be more substantial. Lake views great. 
0; Staff were friendly and helpful, the restaurant was great as was the view. The problem with the hotel were the actual rooms, for the money paid I'd expect it to not look run down, it would've been a lot better if it had just had a lick of paint and some new furnishings.  I wouldn't return here as the rooms weren't worth the asking price, everything else was brilliant, next time I'll spend a bit more and get something a lot nicer. 
0; On checking in the good news was that we had been upgraded to an Executive Room. The receptionist was polite and efficient but looking back possibly on commission for upselling us dinner in the restaurant which we urged to book as it was getting booked up. This turned out to be nonsense. Pre dinner drinks were quite expensive but the real problem here is with the restaurant. The restaurant is sandwiched between the bar area and a one of the functions room that was being used that evening. Despite the endless flow of people either arriving for the wedding reception and leaving it to get drinks the restaurant descended into a walkway. Also if the door to the function room was opened, as it was quite a lot, the restaurant went from a place where you could quite happily have a conversation to a noisy environment where you simply couldn't. Nothing wrong with the food although expensive for what it was. I would question the need for one table to be used to store napkins and table cleaning spray and cloths as this doesn't help the ambience. Overnight we had a good sleep and found the hotel very clean and quiet. Breakfast was entirely adequate with the only fly in the ointment being that our drinks were cleared from our table whilst we left it to get our next course. I'd check your bill carefully as we had an extra £19 added for drinks that were nothing to do with us. This charge was quickly removed though. Overall I doubt we'd stay here again. My impression that was that the majority of staff were too young and/or inexperienced which may help the hotel with it's running costs BUT doesn't make for good customer service. 
0; The hotel is generally ok, not great and not bad, but it does lack staff!  During check in had to wait at least 10mins before been acknowledged, then had to wait 15mins at the bar before been acknowledged, so it went on during our stay, when even checking out we had to wait 10mins.  Our stay resembled something from a sit-com, one person appeared to running around between the reception, bar and portering duties, the only thing I didn’t see the person doing was cleaning, but I am sure given time I would have.  The hotel is only as good as it staff but due to the lack of staff this hotel is poor 
0; We have stayed here when flying several times in the past , utilising car parking facilities etc, and have really valued the Hotel. We loved the international feel and excellent service. Sadly not so this time. Stayed 2 nights before flying which internet booking could not cope with ... but what really saddened us was the overall poor standard this time of staff - wrong info given, twice told 'come back later, tomorrow' etc - where's the excellence of very recent past gone? Both public bars far too hot. Room needed new carpet - that's OK ... but not overall poor quality of service. We will look elsewhere in future, sadly. 
0;We booked a seaview room for our 30th aniversary, reservations e-mailed and said they would mark the fact on our booking but it was not mentioned at all. Why raise expectations and then do nothing. On checking in we had to wait around while the room safe was changed as it had ben locked and could not be opened, we then found there were no bathrobes so we had to ask for them. On Saturday morning the breakfast was cold and in the afternoon we were locked out of our roomand had to wait for the lock to be reset.   The manager gave us complimentary drinks and reduced our room rate but no one else even said sorry.  A great weekend but I expected more from this class of hotel.
0;Hilton standards are dropping - the price is remaining high. For £250 per night you do expect to have a very clean and very up to date hotel, with a fresh cooked breakfast. The hotel is looking a bit tired and shabby, lifts are not working properly - generally needs redecorating. The music was too loud in the reception.
0;" For a treat we decided to stay here overnight at the start of our holiday, booking a 'classic' double room for £230 for one night. The hotel was very atmospheric, the staff friendly and helpful, and the buffet-style breakfast good quality. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, although we were offered a complimentary hot drink on arrival. The rather dark room felt as if it had been created out of a corner of the building, and we were offered a complimentary Mail on Sunday or Sunday Times, but as we wanted The Observer we had to pay for it, which we thought was extremely stingy given how much we were paying for the room. There was a large wedding reception being held at the hotel, as apparently is the case most weekends, and this totally destroyed the ambience of the hotel which we had been looking forward to enjoying, for as soon as we left our room there were lots of people milling about excitedly; we were also kept awake until at least midnight by the wedding reception disco pounding away. We completed a comment card along these lines when we left, and the management wrote to us subsequently asserting that they felt the price of the room represented value for money. We disagree; at the end of our holiday we stayed in Stamford again, at a boutique B&B in a restored Georgian house charging £100 per night, just a stone's throw from The George; we were greeted with the offer of a glass of chilled wine on their garden patio (at no extra cost); parking was outside the B&B rather than a fair walk away, we had use of a very atmospheric living room; sherry and chocolates were in our room, and the room and bathroom were also larger and better appointed than at The George. No guesses as to where we will stay when next in Stamford ! "
0; Just returned from the Great British Alternative Music Festival at Butlins. Really enjoyed the event, good selection of bands and the two main stages are well set up for this kind of event with good sound/lighting etc. The only downside for me was how poor the mattresses were in the accommodation. Admittedly, we had only paid £160 for the two of us in a silver room which is great value for a three night music break - but to lie there each night and feel metal springs pressing hard into your ribs is perhaps not the customer experience that Butlins is aiming for. It's a shame this has not been addressed because there seem to be other similar comments left like this. Anyway, hope to go back again next year because it was a great event.... but I'll be bringing an air mattress with me next time! 
0;" This is the third time we have stopped at this hotel. Our first stay, shortly after it opened, was excellent but it seems to have gone down over the years. Although nothing specifically wrong with the hotel the room we got is looks like it needs a refurb; the carpets are tired and the walls marked although the bathroom was in a good condition. The red, black and white theme is also starting to look out of date.  On the ground floor the staff seemed to be rushing round both in the evening and at breakfast but not combing tasks such as ignoring a table that needs clearing. Breakfast was good although a bit cheeky to charge extra for an omelette.  We'll probably look for somewhere different to stay in our regular trip to Manchester - as shame as the location is excellent. "
0; My wife and I are regular cruisers and stay in southampton often.  This was our first stay here.  Super customer service. Excellent pool and new hot tub.  Rooms are large and well equipped.  Some areas within rooms and hall ways are looking a bit tired.  If you are looking for a nice place to stay where you will be looked after this is the place for you.  We will be back. 
0; Avarage hotel, average breakfast, no charm, no character, typical corporate hotel, could be any chain and has been. The fish are still swimming in the indoor pool, just as they were 10 years ago. Creit card to cover any aditional expenses is a cash management scam, take £50, keep it for a week, just in case. Not nice. Wifi, these days another utility, should be provided as a matter of course. Is it free or do they charge? Not sure, and its not clear from the guide. Time will tell. Room clean and comfortable, but no more than you'd expect. Overall nothing to write home about, but no real issue. Bland is the word. 
0; Overall a pleasant hotel let down by some lack of attention to detail in the bedrooms. Nice location away from main roads etc. although why staff have to empty glass bottles into a waste bin outside your room at 7.00am baffles me - surely it can wait. The public areas of the hotel are pleasant but my room (#3) showed signs of not being maintained properly. A slightly damp smell was confirmed when I looked at the ceiling and saw unrepaired water damage. In the bathroom part of the shower mixer fittings were missing as was some the tiling around the bath. Nothing to ruin the stay but maybe an indication of other issues elsewhere (I only stayed one night).  All the staff were pleasant and helpful and dinner and breakfast in the restaurant were fine. I would return although would look for some of the more modern rooms in future. 
0;Basic holiday inn hotel, exactly what I would have expected. This was part of the deal with the parking company. Staff went out of there way to help. But the hotel was okay for a one night sleep. We had a good breakfast at the local  waitrose store rather than paying £15 a head.
0; Love Novotel hotels as they are dog friendly. The rooms are standard format. Often stay in York Novotel and this one in leeds is not as dog set up as York. Major problem I have is the air con that does not exist. When you complain that the room is getting hotter the answer is its not air con it's a room cooling system which frankly is daft. Why don't they come clean and say it just don't work. So rooms can be very hot so ask for a fan. Staff are all friendly and helpful. Ideal situation as just on the river for the dog. 
0; This was a bit of a treat for us as the hotel is on our doorstep but we got a good deal. The bar area has been refurbished and looks pretty good. Although £3.95 for a bottled beer is expensive. I paid 5p more at Gatwick Hilton last month. The room is standard but the shower room (no bath) is really nice. As previous reviewers stated there is no aircon and it is hard to get the room cool- I went home and got a fan! The lift broke down on our second night which was a real pain. For a hotel of that size I would have expected a number of lifts rather than the dated looking 1. Maybe an area that could be improved upon rather than just the flat screen tvs, shower rooms and bar area? I'd say use the Novotel if you get a good deal but certainly not worth the £130 rack rate. 
0; This seems to be the hotel of choice for my company. Standard rooms are adequate, but on a couple of my visits I've found the heating to be very dependant on where in the hotel you are. Very friendy staff, great breakfasts, but I'm a little dissappointed by the restaurant and prefer to either eat in the bar or go our to the varied eateries around the Bedford area. Internet is woefully slow, but enough to check emails, etc. Excellent view over the river though. 
0; The hotel is a 10 minute shuttle ride from the airport, which leaves half-hourly from the bus station opposite the front of the terminal (go via the underpass under the road from inside the terminal). It costs £3, which seems a bit mean given that anyone using the bus will be a hotel guest flying from the airport - couldn't this be included in the room rate?  Plus points - very handy for the airport. The food in the restaurant was very good, I thought, and decent value, with pleasant and brisk service. The room rate I paid was also very good value and the staff members very pleasant indeed. The shuttle bus starts its service very early and so does the restaurant, good for early flyers.  Negatives - £3 for bus, rooms VERY dated (most of the hotel is, in fact) and very much in need of renovation. The bathrooms in particular really need replacing. The rooms are also pretty small and quite noisy, not ideal when you have to get up at 4am. 
0;" Stayed there on business for one night in early July. Check in was OK, receptionist rang us about 20 mins after to make sure everything was OK which was a nice touch. The room itself was clean and adequate but not &quot;spacious&quot; as described on the website. The Apple media centre was a nice touch although the TV picture was blurry which was probably due to the graphics card. On the minus side the bathroom door would not lock and it took several goes to flush the toilet. £12 for car parking is also excessive. Can't comment on the food as we ate out. Would probably stay there again. "
0; As a quite frequent visitor to the Hilton and Brighton, we decided to have the August Bank holiday there and I am afraid that the service didn't come up to the same standard as previous stays. We had to change room due to the excessive noise coming from the next room (which could be shared) even after calls to reception nothing was done about our complaint so we moved. Breakfast was a nightmare the food as always was excellent but the staff, most of them could understand or speak English and had little urgency about them with requests have to be made a number of times. Very poor. The bar was awash when we popped in for a drink before going out for a meal, fridges were empty and even house wine wasn't available. Really Hilton you need to get your act together. 
0;Room and food all excellent. Reception and pre booking not so good - need training in this particular area. Excellent for wembley stadium and arena and local shops but not much else to do Close to underground stations, but to get there on a friday afternoon from central London by car is horrendous and not good for stress levels
0; Haven't been to a Malmaison for a while. Even after a refurb this hotel seemed a tad dated. The black is the new black was a novelty back in the day, but I don't want to feel I'm in a film noir, living in the shadows pilfering hotel toiletries any more. The plus sides were the location, friendly staff and comfortable beds. The biggest surprise was what we believed to be an Amuse Bouche served in a cavalier manner for breakfast. On closer inspection it turned out to be a raw egg placed in an egg cup. That's either an outrageously 'out there' culinary statement or the height of sloppiness. I'll go for the latter and deduct one point from my score. Shame. 
0;" A bit of a surprise find, in central Bristol.   Close to the squares and the night life, this hotel does look &quot;like a Russian embassy from the 1970's&quot; as one friend put is. Not much to look out outside, and the surrounding urban area means you don't expect to find a hotel there!  The rooms are a good size, and the bar is lovely. Breakfast was fair.  However, the service was alittle slow first thing in the morning, with checkouts going on, and too few staff to deal with it. "
0;" I have just returned from a two night stay at the Welcombe hotel. The break was booked by my two children as a 70th birthday present. As it was a surprise I was not familiar with the arrangement other than the fact that my daughters request for three rooms was changed after accepting a suggestion of a three bedroom apartment. First impressions were very positive, magnificent building and grounds, very impressive location. Played golf on day 1, ladies spent afternoon in spa. Golf course very enjoyable, well maintained and variable in character. Told that the Spa was very good but changing rooms very untidy, signs of poor staffing levels or lazy attitudes. Things started to go wrong when the young lady at the restaurant reception had no knowledge of our table reservation and had no interest whatsoever in attempting rectify the error. She was quite rude. Fortunately the restaurant &quot;manager&quot; courteously and efficiently found our booking. At this point it should be recorded that the food quality was excellent and the above mentioned gentlemen went out of his way to make our visit enjoyable. On the restaurant theme on night two our greatest disappointment occurred when we discovered that the &quot;table d'hote&quot; menu was almost identical to the previous evening. Not what I expect from a hotel of this quality. Our apartment (Montagu) was very comfortable and well appointed, in many ways ideal for a family group. However a couple of points should have been picked up by house keeping, all three bedroom tv's had no remote control and the venetian blind in the master bedroom had clearly been broken for a long time. Finally I would like to point out that your web site contains erroneous and misleading information regarding the apartment. No Wifi, minimal tv channels, no sky sports, no coffee tea making facilities in the bedrooms.  I am not a serial complainer and would not have made these comments but my family had organised what was considered to be a high class hotel for a special occasion. It is a high class hotel and we had a very good time there. It could have been better and should have been. "
0; If it wasn't for the location The Tower by Guoman would be a mediocre hotel. The service is dated, as is the decor. The Galleria restaurant on the upper foyer is just plain boring. The 12th floor conference rooms are old fashioned - BUT they are efficiently serviced and have the things that you need for meetings, workshops and the like. And the views are fantastic - the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, HMS Belfast, the Thames, the City etc. St Katherine's Dock is on the doorstep. Borough Market is a short walk away. The location is terrific if you want to explore London. If only it didn't look like a set of local council offices from the outside... 
0; My wife and I took a 3 day break in the Lake District and took advantage of a deal we seen on the internet. it states 4 star, however I would say that this will have to be based upon the staff who work in the hotel. The rooms/hotel that we stayed in are in need of an upgrade, felt/seemed like the 70s!! Having said that we fully enjoyed our stay in the hotel, the room and hotel was clean, bed was great and we slept well. The best part of the hotel are the staff, very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them, they are the real stars of this hotel. Two issues that need to be sorted, first is the wifi, in this day and age it is a basic requirement to have it available across the full hotel And not just the front part!! Second is crossing the road, hotel is right on the road which can be busy, , to get to the lake across the road is not a good experience, I think the hotel needs to push to get this dealt with soonest. 
0;" Lovely staff and good food. No heating in my room and heard lots of other guests complaining of the same or poorly functioning showers ( some only working with cold water) and baths - plugs not fitting drainage holes. When this was mentioned to the volunteer walk leaders the usual reply was &quot; It's difficult to heat an old large house such as this&quot;  Would stay here again only if the heating and shower problems resolved "
0;" Stopped here with my Disabled Father for 1 week in Sept Plus Points Friendly welcome and ease of check-in,nice spacious Room that catered for most of my Dads needs except for not having a walk in shower(was already aware of this prior to check in though). Great outdoor seating area right by the river with curtious and attentive staff that served drinks and snack and were always available for a chat. Great central location for all the attractions in Stratford. Minus Points Housekeeping was sometimes laxed, Room was often cleaned late in the day when someone of my Dads mobility nneds everything available in his room asap-sometimes Towels were in correctly replaced or even missing as was the Tea/Coffee replenishment. Food in the restauraunt was mixed-Breakfast was great but Dinner service was mixed.Twice I ordered a Lamb Shank which was completely inedible- when I complained though it was satisfactorly replaced with something far superior.The Chef on duty at the Buffet seemed to lack general product knowledge,describing one Desert to a Couple as &quot;some kinda Tart&quot; ? Rest of the Meals we had were ok but gererally lacking in variety(No Beef unless you wanted Steak and Lamb.. well ive already covered that one !! Dad was taken ill on the penultimate day of our trip sadly and at that point we were fully prepared and looking forward to returning to this Hotel.This will no longer happen for the following reason--- On checkout we were overcharged initially to the tune of nearly £300- when I questioned this the receptionist disappeared and on return produced an amended Bill which was correct but neither offered an appology or offered a Discount on the day we had lost due to my Dads ill health.Its a real shame that this marred an otherwise enjoyable holiday but on this basis and the other faults mentioned it is not likely that we will return :( .  p.s Manager seems friendly and approacable "
0; Paid in advance for a room after a late flight arrival. Room decor was a bit tired this time but we had a better room on a previous stay. Nice breakfast and service. Gym equipment needed maintained. Free 24Hr pick up from the Terminals is handy though. 
0; Got this room for a good rate ,however that £5 charge for parking is not on ,especially when the barrier was open anyway.Also breakfast is a bit steep at £12.50 a pop. Nice room and facilities though. 
0;" I stayed with a colleague here on business for 2 nights . The hotel was busy due to a local conference and parking in the hotel carpark was very difficult .check in was ok and efficient . My room was a double, reasonably furnished and warm ( it was freezing outside).... But we both noticed when we checked in , there was a strange smell in the corridors, like blocked drains???This seemed to linger all the first night. The room was comfortable and decent sized, but a little dark, making it hard to read or write anything. Bed comfortable , bathroom adequate. Next morning the buffet breakfast was good, with decent quality bacon, sausages etc.but all the fried eggs were overcooked and hard.the &quot;smell&quot; of the day before had gone.the bar area was friendly and warm , with good Tetley bitter on draught.Second nights sleep was not good due to an extractor fan just outside the room being on all night.breakfast once again good, but all fried eggs once again hard. Checkout quick and efficient. I found this hotel ok, but could have been better with a little more effort.saying that, I would stay again if in the area on business, or pleasure "
0;Our room was a decent size with a very big comfortable bed. The décor was very dark and the furniture beginning to show its age. The bathroom was nice, well fitted out with a shower over the bath. There was a towel warmer and the toiletries supplied were good.The hotel throughout was furnished in very dark wood which was approaching its sell by date. The evening meal was nicely presented but the portions were small. There were plenty of staff in evidence and service was quick. They seemed to be trying to get patrons in and out as quickly as possible. The buffet breakfast was poor. There was only sliced bread no rolls or any thing. Only two fruit juices, and no water. No fresh fruit was offered. The hot offerings were sausages bacon eggs, and fried bread. The staff were very slow to clear the tables. When we checked out we were asked to pay for some drinks which we had not had. When asked to produce the docket they said oh! never mind then. Were they trying it on? I cannot comment on the leisure facilities as we did not use them. Would we go back? No.
0;We stayed at the hotel for four nights, I am sure because we arrived by coach, there being some 34 of us travelling from Yorkshire with our local Probus club, we had to eat before the other guests, i.e. at 6.30pm prompt. Our meal had to be booked from a limited menu provided at breakfast each morning. You would not recommend friends to try this restaurant if this was the best they could provide. At times the food was warm, never hot, everything plated up, just like being back at school. However the breakfast was a feast of a meal enjoyed b y everyone of our party. The bar was very pricey and quite a shock at the charges they made again not one again to recommend to friends. Our room was bright, clean and well appointed apart from the lack of hanging space for two adults staying for four nights. It's the only hotel I have ever stayed in where the guests stand back and the staff use the lifts to remove dirty items down to the kitchen, what are you playing a? The hotel is ideally placed for trips away. We enjoyed Winchester, Salisbury, the motor museum of Lord Montagu of Beaulie , and a drive in the New Forest. all very enjoyable.
0;" What a shame; we've often been to this normally well run hotel for lunch normally on a Sunday and have been impressed. However as a family group of 7 (2 of whom are approaching 80) we had a very poor experience that, to be frank, took the gloss of our party's Mothering Sunday celebration. Having booked, and paid in full, for 2.30 some 2 months previously we were surprised to find the hotel in the middle of extensive alterations that we were not at any time informed of. The previous welcoming entrance leading to a comfortable bar had disappeared and entry to the renowned restaurant was by a poorly signed long walk through the hotel corridors to the rear of the restaurant. When we found the restaurant's rear entry, arriving 5 minutes prior to the 2.30 reservation time, we were shocked to find ourself in an area with a waiting group of about 30 dinners awaiting seating. The line was somewhat slowly dissipated and a further number of parties of diners arrived after us and were also led to their tables leaning our party still waiting. 3 separate apparent managers came out to ask our name and said &quot;your table will be ready in 2 minutes&quot; this horrible uncomfortable wait continued for just about an hour. We won't go on about the lack of nearby toilets!Eventually, without apology, we were led to a table in a room that contained the carvery and no windows. Followed by an unusually very mediocre 3 course lunch . . Nothing like the service and food that we had enjoyed so many times previously. It took a complaint by one of our party to a person who appeared to be a section supervisor to receive a very halfhearted apology! We had thought that our day would have been superb as the normal Sunday price had more than doubled. When we finished our meal we were presented with a bill for the drinks.. We noticed that the alcoholic drinks had not been charged for; but the gloss was even removed from that halfhearted gesture by their leaving on the bill 3 highly priced 750ml bottles of water! Still that final cock-up ended proceedings with a bit of unintended humorous laughter on our part. Why on earth the hotel risked their reputation by such an out of character poorly run event is beyond me. Why didn't they pre-alert us of the problems that were bound to happen? I hope they get back to their old self soon!! I hope to review again in the future more positively!  "
0; Owing to limited availability elsewhere I decided to stay again on a B&B basis. Having had a very poor experience with their rude management last time my first hope was that I never saw the same guy as before. I checked in approx 8:30pm with noone around so I had to search for someone. My room (53) was fine all except for the rusted stains on the floor from the radiator, carpet needs replacing, shower cannot make its mind up if it is hot/cold and the biggest surprise... no mini Champney products... instead they had Gilcrest & Sloane.  I had a yoghurt and coffee for a quick 5min breakfast before dashing for my train. I slept well and the room warm. I never used the facilities so could not say if had improved. Judging by my room though id doubt it. All in all I spent just over 11hrs there.  
0;" I have stayed here for the last six years for a business event. It has slowly improved bu there are still perennial problems, mostly revolving around air conditioning issues.  It comes as no surprise that Brighton in August can be hot, yet it always seems to catch out the air conditioning at this hotel, both in the rooms and the event space.  The staff and their responsiveness have improved hugely, especially over the last couple of years, but the rooms remain expensive for what we get.  Excellent breakfast though, and even better if you can eat outside as was available at the weekends.  If the a/c had worked would have given a fourth &quot;star&quot;! "
0; Hotel room was clean but tired, reception friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is a bit pretentious and overpriced. I decided to have the soup to start and it was very good. I considered the steak, but as there was only one option and pricey decided on the ranch burger, a big mistake and again expensive for a burger. Totally over cooked no steak knife offered the worst burger in the world, the waiter seemed too inexperienced to deal with the feedback. I think he did inform the kitchen. I paid the bill and left it at that. Would I say again - Possibly. Would I eat in the restaurant - No 
0; Wanted to give our grandson a special day in Thomas Land so booked for one night. Got into the room, there was a problem with the plug in the sink, but we couldn't ring reception as the phone didn't work! They did come and replace the plug. We didn't have dinner as the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast was not good, things had been rushed out for people, which meant much of it was undercooked and did not taste at all nice. Not sure this is worth the money you pay because it's close to the park. 
0;" The longest review I have ever given - I booked for my wife's birthday, I was keen to stay there as it is very local and many people have raved about it over the years. We went for a suite the tower, and a spa and dinner package - not cheap. I hate giving bad reviews as you will see from my previous comments. As soon as we arrived there was a delay because the room key maker was faulty... we went to the room anyway but, the room was shabby to be honest, dirty walls, toilet seat was old and stained yellow, carpet was shabby and unkempt, old TV.... the list could go on. I asked for a room change and the very friendly staff were helpful and sorted a smart newly refurbished room out :-) happy. We then went to the spa, the table we sat at was dirty and sticky, not been wiped recently. Went to my locker and there was no robe as there should have been, massage was very good, generally the spa was 5/10 it is old and needs sharpening up. Dinner was very good (7/10)- well done chefs and the service was good too :-) We are getting picky here but we noticed several clocks that hadn't been changed since the hour went forward at the weekend... Breakfast was nice but... ketchup had run out (nobody had checked recently clearly) I asked for a top up of the ketchup bowl, very friendly member of staff obliged without hesitation, and then bought the same old sticky bowl back filled up, instead of getting a nice fresh clean bowl - why?????  Anyway, we got to reception to leave, the bill was wrong, two very polite rectifications on it was thereabouts, although they added £8 service for the restaurant without asking. All in all it was 'okay'. I won't be going back - very underwhelming. I have to say all the staff were very friendly and did appear to want to do their best, I think standards were not being monitored and maintained - for me that's always the job of the top people - sorry. As I say, I hate not giving positive reviews but there the leader does just not appear to be &quot;on it&quot; as we know they have to be with a passion... "
0; We stayed here for one night before flying to Europe - we booked a 'Park HERE - fly there' rate - naively believing that we would park at the hotel, as we have done at many other Marriott airport hotels. NO! Your car is taken away in the middle of the night and returned to you at the terminal on your return. As it happened, the system worked perfectly, but it was not what we were expecting - hence we had items in the car that we would otherwise have removed.  The hotel itself is fairly typical, but as a Courtyard, and as an airport hotel. The room was spacious and comfortable, the TV fairly lacking in channels and the bar / restaurant expensive.  The hotel offers a shuttle to the airport, but it is only a few minutes walk away along a flat, well marked path, so the shuttle is a waste of money - even if you have luggage.  All in all we had a good night's sleep, and the car was returned in good condition, so I would have no problem staying here again when we fly out of LGW. 
0; We had been looking forward to our stay at Ockenden Manor to celebrate my wife's birthday for some time. We arrived after an enjoyable day exploring the Sussex Weald. The Hotel, bedecked in a wonderful Horsham Stone roof bathed in the late afternoon's summer sun looked an absolute delight, so inviting! We were excited to have arrived! Unfortunately our delight was short lived as we then underwent the humiliation of what could best be described as a Fawlty Towers moment. Upon checking in we were both made to feel extremely awkward and uncomfortable by a member of staff who regarded us as an inconvenient intrusion. Once the formalities of the signature and credit card details had been dispensed with, directions to the Lounge and dining Room were barked at us with complete disinterest. The spa facility was mentioned but there was no elaboration as to how or even if we were entitled to use it. As we were escorted to our room we felt like naughty school children. The room was ok. Large and airy. There had been a wedding the day before and a legacy of this, we suspect, was a neatly wrapped baby's nappy occupying a conspicuous position on the lawn. We returned to the lounge just in time to experience the last offerings of afternoon tea, although we had to ask for the milk! Ok, so these were the negatives. The positives, a sublime evening meal with excellent service in a dining room that still afforded a view of that nappy! Excellent breakfast served in a relaxed and restful environment. We ventured to the Spa but really didn't feel in the right frame of mind to use it. Ockenden Manor is part of a group of three exclusive hotels that jointly market their services. My advice is to consider either of the other two in preference. Ockenden Manor comes a poor third in my view. 
0;" It's a &quot;Q&quot; Hotel - used to be a De Vere. Typical of the UK's older hotel stock in that there has been a lack of investment in infrastructure and the quality of the rooms at bathrooms are variable. Some are very good whilst others are in need of some TLC - it's the luck of the draw. Staff are very pleasant and efficient and bar area is OK but expensive. Food is what you would expect and don't expect too much (the breakfast is actually pretty ropey - a horrific buffet affair that is worse than most I have tried). Pool is fine but the gym is cramped, smelly and the equipment is creaky and ancient. Needs a re-think. "
0; We stayed here last year for my birthday and they really made us feel special. This year it was just like any other hotel. They do free wine and cheese but they have changed the wine and it's pretty grim and they have changed the biscuits with the cheese so it's like eating a beer mat. Now yes it's a bit picky moaning about the free stuff but that's what made this hotel better than the rest. The rooms are very small and we accept that but we still came back this year because of the above average service.  Ok the hotel is still clean and tidy the staff are still friendly. It's still in a great location but for us its lost its sparkle. Will we return next year.... probably not. 
0;" When we stayed at the My Hotel in Brighton I was reminded of a Steve Jobs quote: &quot;Design is not just what it looks and feels like, design is how it works&quot; but unfortunately for the wrong reasons.  The look and feel of the public spaces and rooms is modern and funky, lots of curves and bright colours. For me however it fell down on some simple practicalities – for example our room, a More Superior Double on the third floor, had only one comfy chair, the cord on the hair dryer was not long enough to reach from any socket to a mirror, the heating was inefficient so we were chilly, there was a lack of space in the bathroom area to put anything, the sound on several of the TV channels was distorted and every time I used the Wi-Fi I had to re-enter the password.  We stayed for two nights and on the second night our sleep was disturbed four times by an alarm going.  On the plus side the room was clean and spacious, the bed was comfortable and the hotel is in a good location with plenty of restaurants nearby – specifically the Chilli Pickle, which we enjoyed, is in the same building.  I would stay here again for the location but not for the experience. "
0;"The good bits: Stayed for 4 nights over the weekend, very close to bustling city centre, but surprisingly quiet room at back of Hotel (314) which was a good size with shed loads of storage. The bathroom was spotless, and there's lashings of water from both the shower and the basin, with very nice hand wash gels and the like provided. The staff in all departments were extremely friendly, courteous, and efficient, and the cleaners deserve special praise as they did an excellent job of returning the room to pristine condition each morning. Easy walk up the hill for all local eateries and the Cathedral is a must see no matter how long you stay. Parking is very limited, but we were lucky and always found somewhere on the site to leave the banger (although there is a local arrangement with a space a short walk away if you're not so fortunate) staff were happy for me to slot my car into any   The not so good bits: no plug in basin, eventually replaced, but wouldn't hold water, and neither would the bath. The heat on the top floor was almost unbearable, and the bathroom was like a sauna. I couldn't figure this out at all as the ground floor seemed ok??. what made this worse was the room has no aircon; and when I mentioned the oppressive heat to reception they very quickly asked if there was a fan in the wardrobe; suspect they knew this to be an issue, but why not have it fixed?? Could have done with a small fridge in the room to keep the water / milk cold (my wife hates the UHT stuff they give you) Black mould round the edges of the window frames, and condensation inside the double glazed panes. TV remote was worse than useless at times refusing to work even from the bed right in front of it. Breakfast was so so, with cool dry bacon, watery eggs, drying out beans, and what tasted like microwaved mushrooms, sausages were fab though!! (we tried it on the first morning and subsequently went to JK's sandwich shop, up to lights on hill and turn left, 50 yards on the left. great hot food, full English or breakfast baps etc, lovely courteous capable staff, and good VFM..) If the breeze was in the wrong direction you can't open the windows in 314 without a nose full of cooking smells from the adjacent Café Rouge extractor.  And finally; when will hotels realise they need to have more consideration for smokers which my wife and I are? No outside shelter which really gets up my nose.... how different could it be if they thought a bit more, and even put up a nice little canopy or suchlike just outside somewhere. I consider this to be some what inconsiderate, unlike other hotels I use regularly which are supposedly in the &quot;budget&quot; category, and have clearly thought about these things...  All in all this is not a bad place, but there are some &quot;rough edges&quot; I really didn't expect for the price and the star rating. I guess the issues appear to be very much &quot;first world problems&quot; but having stayed in some extremely good hotels, one is always in danger of comparison and unfortunately Clarion collection simply didn't measure up on enough fronts to encourage me to stay there in future without some significant improvements."
0; unable to use emerald card  premier staff very polite and friendly--as are Bristol people  NO BUFFET BREAKFAST---the cooked breakfast that came had overcooked sausages and eggs  the toilets behind reception should be closed as a health hazard----cistern not working--damp up the walls---putrid smell of URINE---this at 12 noon  would definitely go to Bristol again---CERTAINLY NOT THIS HOTEL 
0;This hotel has a good location for business, being just off the M11. It is reasonably priced for Cambridge, with leisure abilities, although fairly basic. The pool has seen better days, tiles missing beneath the surface, a sauna that was only 65 degrees, barely warm...and rooms that are okay, a reasonable size, but bathrooms loping a little tired.  The food is also a bit basic, i started with chicken skewers which tasted like reformed chicken which was a little unpleasant, then for main course, I had prawn Thai curry and that was a very loose description...prawns in barely a Thai sauce, not cooked with green peppers, or anything to really give it the zing of Thai food. A simple jar of thai green curry sauce would have been better.   The table next to me ordered an Eton Mess for dessert and it came with no meringue in it, and so that was sent back.  The staff do a good job, are attentive and helpful, which is a shame. That is all beyond their control.   Get a decent chef in and sort out the food and people will appreciate it more.   It's okay and this is not to put you off using it if the value and position is okay for you. Just perhaps think about eating elsewhere   
0; we stayed for 4 nights and got a reasonable deal on a spa room on the ground floor which had the advantage of a patio which was useful as the weather was warm and sunny. The room itself was quite small and was a little tatty and the bathroom had a shower over the bath which I hate. It was also very warm even with the door open at night. The last night we suffered from some of a wedding party drinking most of the night and not going to bed until 5.30am and beyond. I blame the hotel for this if you have guests not going to the wedding then you should close the bar at a reasonable hour say 1am. my wife tells me the spa and pool were fantastic with the pool being large for a hotel. The meals were a mixed bag, the main restaurant has a very limited menu which doesn't change much. I don't think the starters changed at all during our stay and there was not much variation of main courses. two of the meals I ate in there were excellent the third was awful. We tried the other restaurant once and again it was distinctly average. Breakfast was freshly prepared during the week which was a refreshing change but on Saturday that changed to the usual hot buffet with the obvious down grade in quality. The staff were excellent and the setting is wonderful, earlier comments about the state of the public rooms is accurate the curtains are covered in dust and there are spider webs everywhere. The hotel has plans to build a further 20 rooms which I find surprising as it seems to struggle to cope with the guests it has now. Our 4 night stay including drinks and 2 spa treatments cost over £1200 and I am not convinced that this was good value for money. It could be a wonderful hotel with a little TLC and some investment a shame really. 
0; The title says it all really. Tired but functional. A not quite knackered mattress, bath squeezed into a too small space. Breakfast food good but only if you are ok with absolutely no service and don't mind trekking to what is essentially a self service canteen with cleaners. There are better hotels out there for the same price. 
0; Arrived at 2.45 to be told by the girl , no name as none if the staff have badges. Was greeted with the words you will have to wait while I sort my till out . Then she told us check in wax at 3, then made us wait till 3 . Not a warm welcome . On Christmas Day a girl behind the bar made us wait while she was texting on her mobile . No complaints about the room apart from TV picture kept breaking up . The rest of the staff were very helpful and friendly . Rest if the family joined us for dinner and paid £85 per head . There was another restaurant which was smaller and had table cloths on the table and arm chairs , here it was only £39 per head , the only difference we had an extra course which was salmon . Not worth the extra £46. Won't be returning next Christmas . 
0; A mixed review: room was very nice and clean, but shower was installed for a midget - at 6 feet tall I am not unusual, so why should I have to crouch to get showered? Hotel staff were friendly and mostly helpful, but there was some sloppy work at reception regarding change of booking from B&B to DB&B for one night only, then B&B for second night. Surely this ought to be routine and very simple? But it wasn't. Wi-Fi is said to be free - big sticker on entrance door. Reception in bedroom was lousy, had to take laptop to public area at reception to download emails. Restaurant was pretentious and overpriced: I wouldn't recommend it, but nearest good alternative eating is about 2 miles away. Pool, steam-room and sauna were good, and staff there were helpful. So on balance, this is an average hotel, some good and some bad. 
0; Originally booking at other accommodation,but not recorded ,and fully booked when we arrived .so ,forwarded on to Fitzrovia, Felt hotel overpriced for size of room and quality of decor and furnishings ,bath to deep and if much older. Guest would not have been able to get out of it .Front desk staff ,English language barely competent ,had difficulty making self understood ,same with Dining room staff ,all very pleasant ,and tried hard ,but !Breakfast was however of good quality,I would not stay here again,the standard was not good enough for the price and much better is available ,in the area Denis M Henderson 
0; I have always looked forward to my stays at Hilton but my recent stay was forgetable. The room was too small and the location near the lifts was too noisy, the breakfast plentious but unimaginative. The only compliment goes to the staff manning the reception. 
0; Hosted the company yearly golf day here July 7th 2016. The golf facilities are superb course was in great nick and everybody had a great day golfing wise. The hotel itself however is quite dated and the rooms reflect this, I'm by sure you should really expect this from a Marriot but it is. Food was fine, (we had lunch, evening meal & breakfast booked) we had a power cut so skipped breakfast as it was going cold, not the hotels fault but it is was it is. Would I recommend this?? Yes for the golf but the Forest Of Arden is a much better hotel with the same golfing facilities. 
0; Not very happy, you would expect hot water to be a minimum you get from a 4 star hotel, was offered an alternative room for a shower but by then my wife had taken a cold shower and we were running late..  The spa was very good ,the buffet was average 
0; We like this hotel. Great location. Good freshly cooked breakfast but this stay was a disappointment. No bedside light, missing desk light, no soap and finally the shower door broke. A pity as previously our stays have been very enjoyable. 
0; We went to Birmingham on a business trip and after finding a great deal on this hotel, we thought it would be a treat to stay in! The approach to the hotel builds high expectations as one drives through the serene countryside and is surrounded by a lush and fertile golf course complete with deers!   Upon arriving check in was a tedious ordeal, with no immediate offer of a trolley for our bags and a disinterested receptionist that didnt seem to notice us .  We requested a quiet room as we had a busy few days scheduled and were looking forward to relaxing times in between. Im not too sure she understood this.  After checking in, the trek to the room through the endless maze of corridors and stairs, pushing our own trolley made me believe it was a worthwhile adventure as we had requested a quiet room.  Unfortunately, when in the room, due to lack of soundproofing, this was not the case as we could hear every noise and door opening or closing down the corridor.   Each night upon return we ate in the dining areas and I cant speak highly enough about the hospitaity and service of the restaurant, bar and kitchen staff. First class in anyones language, along with great food complementing the experience!  Over the weekend there were functions, and our room was incredibly hot, so we had no choice but to open the windows. This also allowed the unwanted noise from the functions to broadcast through our slumber time as well. We requested a room change, and went to the other side of the hotel, to open the windows there and get the noise of early hour check ins and outs instead, along with the delivery vehicle onslaught from 5 am. Not the most enjoyable night of my life.  It must be mentioned that the porters were most understanding and apologetic about this.  The actual room itself, was ok, little lower in standard than what i have come to expect from Marriotts, but with a comfortable bed and clean linen.  All in all the experiance was a little disappointing, i would recommend this hotel for golfers and functions, but not for a quiet break or business trip. 
0; I stayed at this hotel on a business trip to Bournemouth.   Staff were friendly and the guy at reception (Chris I think?) was really helpful and nothing seemed too much trouble.   My main gripe with the hotel was the heat. The public areas have air con but in the Exec room I was booked in the ceiling fan barely made a whir, even on full pelt. We also had repeated power cuts one night (I stopped counting after the fifth one!) which then meant everything came on when the power was restored.   Breakfast was good and again the staff were friendly and welcoming.   The impression this hotel gives of itself on its website to the reality is different. Whilst there seems to have been a spruce up it looks like it has been to cover the cracks more than anything substantial.   All in all it wasn't a terrible experience but it wasn't the best either. 
0; Room was clean, neat and functional. I was disappointed with the following: 1. Bathroom extract fan not working 2. Breakfast vouchers were removed from the room 3. No complimentary water after first day 4. Room door closer slams the door 
0; Very clean, small bedroom but didn't really mind as we only slept there. We didn'teat at the hotel so can't comment on the food.  The duvet was incredibly small though. 
0; stayed on 14th december 2012,inadequate lifts ,1 set inoperable ,ques to use lifts ,stairwell in need of cleaning,bathroom fitments loose ,carpet in room in need of cleaning, not expected from 4 star hotel. 
0; The location of this hotel just off M25 is excellent and reasonably close to underground services into London. Set in well maintained grouns it is a peaceful and good hotel. Thee room although a little bit tired was well maintained and clean however small touches not done well for example the shower toiletries were preiously used so not giving a full bottle and on hospitality sizes this meant insufficent shower gel and shower was struggling to maintain any decent pressure The big failure is the restaurant I arrived in the bar at 7.00pm and asked for a table for 1 immediately or within 30 minures. This the could not do and the earliest available time was 8.00pm as they had a party of eight booked in at 7.15am. Now this is a pet hate of mine if they cannot manage more than 8 people in an hour then they should not be in professional catering at all. I settled for the bar menu so I could eat when I wanted to, the service was good but the food was very much average 
0;" The Old Ship is located on the Brighton Sea Front main road, near most things one wants to do or see in Brighton. The first room offered smelt of paint. The second offered was on the first floor and was too near the road. The third room (which we accepted) was on the top floor. However, during the night, this proved VERY noisy because of the disco (somewhere) and the (literally) screaming drunks on the pavement which were clearly audible well past 2 o'clock in the morning. Because of the noise, we were compelled to keep the windows shut. As there is no air conditioning, the room was too stuffy. The shower was somewhat feeble. The hotel itself is nice, though getting to some rooms with suitcases is &quot;interesting&quot;. The staff are superb - friendly and helpful. The restaurant equally excellent - good choices, nicely presented. However, the issue of noise allied to the lack of air-conditioning made the experience one we would rather forget. "
0; A decent option for those travelling from the Airport the following day. 5 mins from airport terminal. Breaks up the hassle giving you a fresh start to whatever trip you are taking. Hotel is clean and presentable. Good rooms and comfortable beds. A little tired and dated in places but still some.life left in the current rooms.  Lifts were out of action as new ones being installed....which certainly looked the case. Restaurant was very good with decently priced options. Staff were attentive and well presented. A full leisure facility is available...biggest in the UK (quote). ..but this wasn't utilised on this visit so no comment available.  Room service and breakfast options were very expensive which can be extremely off putting when considering other options at other hotels locally.  No reason not to go back but no outstanding reason that would override any urge to check out the competition next time. 
0; An expensive hotel (£400 for 3 nights), but didn't match up to it. Our first room was very hot (no-one knew how to turn off the air conditioning) and extremely smelly. We left the window open for the afternoon and evening, but it was still terrible. To be fair, they changed us to another room the next morning, but we should never have been put in there. Breakfast (in a room that looked like an Indian restaurant) was OK, but we had to ask to get properly grilled tomatoes, and adequate sized portions - not really up to the mark. 
0;" Stayed here for one night with my wife after a friend's amazing wedding. The castle itself is an amazing building with nice views.   The room: We stayed in one of the 'courtyard' rooms. Not sure what they call them, stables maybe? Basically, these are not part of the actual castle but attached to the side. Each 'block' of rooms has one main entrance to the rooms and unfortunately our room was right next to the entrance. We were quite lucky I think during the night as we weren't disturbed by people coming and going but during the day it was a bit intrusive and the main door opening and closing was quite annoying. The room was in keep with the castle; dark, full of cloth over all walls and ceilings, and old style fittings in the bathroom. It was very clean and a reasonable size. If you like dim lights with barely any natural light then I guess the room was perfect. Just not my cup of tea.   Breakfast: I was quite surprised at how small the breakfast area was really, considering the number of guests the castle holds. There were a further 2 weddings taking place at the castle the day our friends got married and we were told to turn up early for breakfast to avoid having to queue. Not great when you consider the price. The breakfast menu was well varied and all sorts of cereals were available to just help yourself with. I had the full english and it was ok. My wife had the eggs Benedict and she really enjoyed it.  Staff: Reception and waiting staff were all very nice. People worked with a smile and everyone was so friendly.   All in all, it was a pleasant stay but it would not be a place I would choose to stay at. However, I can see how some people would find it perfect. "
0; First off, the hotel is beautiful, really lovely both inside and outside. There is a bar downstairs that serves great cocktails (try the Old Fashioned). Unfortunately we had a very poor experience with our room and the staff. We arrived and headed up to our room. It's summer and the halls in the hotel are warm, we went in the room and it was also really warm in the room. There was a fan sitting on the floor switched on in the room. I turned the air conditioner on and we headed out to explore. When we returned it turns out the air conditioner was broken, I can only assume this was known as someone had put the fan in the room and turned it on before we arrived. We contacted reception and were told someone would come up and have a look. We waited in the room for 45 minutes and no one showed up. I went down to reception and was told the duty manager was literally on his way up to the room and I should meet him in the hallway outside the room. Up I headed and low and behold, no one showed up. My wife and I headed back down to reception and they then radioed the on duty manager who turned up at the room. They had previously said there was no other rooms available, we were then told there was one room as they had just had a cancellation and were moved into that room. There were no apologies and the new room was smaller - at least the air conditioner worked!  Too long, didn't read: Lovely hotel, had a really poor experience with the staff handling a broken air conditioner in our room (which was clearly a known fault). You'll probably have a good stay at this hotel but we didn't.  Also, the wifi was very average (although it was free at least). 
0; Large hotel close to Gloucester Road tube station (2 mins walk) Restaurant and a British style pub attached to the hotel. Pub shows football and serves a few typical pub meals. Good value at £9 for meal and a beer. Not the greatest food, but not too bad. Football was showing while I was staying, so it was a bit rowdy.  Hotel rooms are pretty standard, as a priority club platinum card holder I got upgraded to an exec room with iron, free water, chocolate bar, trouser press, safe etc.  One annoying drawback is that the hotel has about 30 floors, so in the morning you can easily be waiting 3-4 minutes for the elevator which is quite annoying when you are late for work!. 
0;" Location is great for a stroll to the restaurants and theatres. Hotel building and rooms are great and clean throughout. Drawbacks; the leisure facilities is tired and requires a sauna. the evening bar represents no more than a coffee counter. We arrived at the bar for 11pm after a night out and found it unmanned and pretty much deserted. That was nothing when compared to the chaotic breakfast service on Sunday morning. The self serve area was cramped, insufficient with food and plates, the toaster just barely warms up the bread and quality of food not passable for this 4 star hotel. Very expensive for what you get. "
0; My partner and I had been wanting to come to this hotel for sometime so thought valentines night would be a perfect time to visit. The location and grounds are beautiful and the spa is clean and lovely which we enjoyed for a good hour on Sunday. However we were very disappointed with our room (room 308) which was a family room and the only room left when we booked very late.com. It was very tired looking and in desperate need of a freshen up. Cracks in walls and bleach stains on the carpets being the worst offenders. Although the bathroom looked nice it was extremely small with an amazing looking walk in shower which too was disappointing when used as there was no hot water. The gap between the shower cubicle and toilet measured no more than 9 inches and seems a little dangerous. As were the exposed wires from the radiator. Also we were above reception and could hear/feel the music fairly loudly in our room even over our own music. Once we realised the music was coming from reception, it was sorted so no real drama. The food in the restaurant (upper deck) was generally very good. The pigeon was especially tasty. However, the T-bone steak didn't really live up to the £26 price tag but you can't win them all I guess. The idea of a cocktail, and a reasonably priced one too, on the pudding menu was a very nice touch, and was also especially tasty. As for the staff, had no issues at all. The hotel was very full but all staff were polite and friendly enough. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a day trip to the spa or a meal in the restaurant. After reading some other reviews, it looks like refurbishments are underway. And I guess with big hotels refurbishments are always underway. I'll put my room down to bad luck I guess, but it did put abit of a dampener on our stay unfortunately. 
0; It was our first visit to this picturesque hotel to attend a wedding reception so I don't want to bad mouth the venue but was left shocked when a drink got placed on a part of the table with a chunk missing & as the table was dressed with a thick cloth it was disguised until the drink fell over and went over my dad. Felt the stituation wasn't handed very professionally, it was definitely not two tables put together. It took over 20 minutes for a solution.. (a menu covering the gap, why couldn't this be used before guests arrived?)  Was dissapointed that we weren't offered a replacement drink but if you dont ask you dont get?   
0; we stayed at the ceder court hotel in harrogate. the rooms were ok however my shower wasnt very hot. the location of the hotel was very good. staff were very friendly and helpful. overall it's a reasonable hotel to stay in 
0; We visited last weekend (bank holiday Monday) staying Friday evening until Monday morning. Staying in the silver chalets (Dolphin). I can only describe it as staying in a caravan without actually being in a caravan. Sounds a little harsh but it was a bit cramped if you are staying for a few nights. Very difficult to get towels dry too. The weather did let us down somewhat but I can say there was activities indoors to accommodate for the weather. That said, it did seem to be expensive. Food wise, we we meals included (breakfast and evening meals). If you are a fussy eater, then this is not for you. breakfast was based on fry up with minimal options. Evening meals were pretty bland but based around a roast dinner option. I would not want to eat there for more than a couple of evenings. Kids entertainment wise, it seemed to be targeted towards young toddlers rather than 8+. Wifi is 30 minutes free, then charged thereafter. But not a strong reception. The overriding issue with this place is if you want to go to a show, get a drink at the bar or even get your breakfast, you are in a queue. Be warned. 
0; We visited London as we had a stand up comedy show to go to.  Booked the hotel for one night and the problems started as soon as we arrived. We were told that the hotels computer systems were down and that EVERY guest will have to fill out a form and come back in a couple of hours to complete the check in. We did just that we went back to the hotel TWO hours AFTER the time we were advised as I believed this would give the staff ample opportunity to sort out their issues. To our surprise NOTHING was done, there was around 150 people just in the lobby area alone waiting to get their rooms. We were then put in a wrong room and had to wait an hour for the manager to actually fix this mess! Staff were friendly (when they felt like it) None the less just unnecessary, it's the Hilton after all right? 
0; We stayed on a Friday night after our Rugby Clubs Summer Ball The room was initially very cold as the Windows had been left open !!!! And there was no temp/air con dial to be found ??? Room itself not to bad clean , nice large bed , tea making facility , no biscuits tho ?! The Ball was held in the Large Function room ,  Luke warm soup Dry hard over cooked pork loin  Insipid white no colour Presume roast potatoes ???  Carrots raw ! Not al dente !!!!  Bought in lemon tart for pud  Very poor quality food especially the main course  Hotel bar etc ok nice grounds , but if that's what is classed as good banquet food we'll probably wouldn't bother and defiantly not recommend !!!!!!! 
0; A few small complaints (creaking noises through the building, not special rooms, not very comfortable bed) and nothing too much on the plus side made me feel that I was considerably over-charged at 175. 100 would have seemed fairer. Good location and staff helped.   
0; We stayed for a long weekend (3 nights) in two standard rooms (1 double and 1 twin). The rooms were small, clean and comfortable. Bathrooms were small but OK - generally clean.  Reception were friendly. Lounge area was nice.  The breakfast experience was the let-down. It was a quite chaotic on the Sunday morning. The hotel was completely full on the Saturday night and when we arrived at breakfast there were at least 12 tables that were still dirty covered in dirty breakfast stuff. They needed to be cleared and re-laid, and as a result, we and other people had to wait in line when this could easily have been avoided with a couple more staff clearing tables. The cooked food from the kitchen was good but the breakfast buffet was hardly replenished. (Pastries were great!) All in all a bit annoying and it let down the experience.  We didn't eat any other meals there (we tried but failed to get a last minute table on Saturday night in the restaurant - perhaps at check-in reception could have asked if we wanted to make a dinner reservation and/or a spa treatment?)   Pool area does feel a bit run down and you have to get to it by walking though the Sports Bar which is not the best (not anything that can be done - that's just how the hotel is laid out).  We didn't golf and didn't use the spa so can't comment on either.  Real feeling is that the hotel is probably a 4* because it has certain facilities but it really feels like a Golf Club with a 3* hotel attached to it rather than a 4* hotel with a golf course.  Overall, it was OK but we wouldn't stay there again. 
0;" My partner and I stayed for one night whilst visiting friends in Bath. The hotel is located off the A36 and is easy to find. First annoyance on arriving is the potholed and muddy car park - I'm sure it adds to the country feel but it would be far better for this to be a decent surface.  The hotel looks charming and welcoming. The desk staff were friendly and accompanied us to our room to show us the way. We'd booked a junior suite at a &quot;late availability&quot; rate of £179 for the night. The room was fine, spacious and comfortable though showing signs of wear and tear with some cobwebs in the corners. The bathroom was modern and clean and the toiletries were Elemis of the type found in many hotels. The bed was extremely soft, which isn't our preference but it was an adequate sleep.   Afternoon tea is served in the lounge, though you probably need to make a reservation for that - something that isn't pointed out so you may end up seated elsewhere. When you get it the afternoon tea was fine, if somewhat pricey.  We didn't eat dinner at the hotel but in the morning we had breakfast in the restaurant. Service was staggeringly slow - we were there for twenty minutes before any food arrived - one hard poached egg of the two soft poached eggs I had ordered accompanied by a rack of white toast instead of the whole wheat we'd ordered on seating!  The staff are all pleasant though clearly some were young and inexperienced and couldn't adapt to the situations put in front of them.  The spa looked nice though you have to exit the building to get to it which isn't ideal in unpleasant weather.  Hotels in this area are pricey but was this worth the price we paid - no, probably not. Would we "
0; I booked this hotel room as a surprise for my wife on our wedding day as we could not afford a honeymoon, I thought it would be nice for both of us to spend the first night as a married couple in the best room the Ramada solihull could provide and I told the reservations clerk this when I booked the month before and she was very helpful and said that the hotel would put a little something in the room to welcome us as it was such a special occasion and that she would leave a note on the reservation to this affect , which she did. I was very disappointed that this promise was not followed though and that nothing had been provided. I was`nt expecting a lot even a `welcome card` would have been nice. I think that personally the hotel let me down in this respect. 
0;We arrived here at around 1pm. The building was lovely and set in nice grounds. The interior was pleasant, maybe a little tired but clean and cosy. On checking in we noticed that there was a wedding party! I generally hate staying at hotels when there is a wedding on, they are loud and disruptive and the majority of the hotel is booked up. We asked for a room away from the wedding party and were upgraded to a suite. The room itself was beautiful, it was the King Suite. Elegantly decorated, incredibly spacious and huge windows with a pleasant view of the green!  Some members of staff were very pleasant, Stephen on reception and the dinner staff were good. Others were professional but not quite as friendly.   As expected with the wedding on we weren't really able to get full use out of the hotel. The main hall was full of wedding guests before we had dinner and all the other rooms other than the restaurant were off limits. The King Suite upgrade did make up for this to some extent but we chose Hand Picked Hotels as we like to enjoy the lovely little rooms and views that these particular hotels usually have. Unfortunately we couldn't really do that so much for this stay. To be fair to the staff, they did do their very best to ensure that the normal guests were effected as little as possible by the wedding party and other than most of the hotel being off limits there was very little disturbance.   All in all a pleasant stay with nice food but when you are paying over £200 for one night you should be able to make use of all of the hotel facilities.
0;The hotel looks nice from outside.but inside needs updating.we stayed here in January it was quiet there.we had an evening meal and breakfast booked with our package. Evening meal was lovely and plenty of it but breakfast was poor the fried eggs were like rubber so wouldn't recommend them. Overall it's a good location for trips to central London and would stay there again.the staff that was on were very friendly and helpfully and seemed to happy.
0; I have stayed here before over 20 years ago when it was in private ownership. It is very convenient for the airport but that's about it.  Holiday Inn average. They really need to re-boot the product. The room smelt damp on arrival and was OK, but glad I hadn't paid the standard room rate.  The evening meal was expensive in comparison with other, better, meals I have had recently, but you've got a treck to find other options so it is the only game in town really. The wifi coped, just.  If you don't mind expensive average then it's fine, but come on HI, you can do better than this. 
0; So, Xmas do recently for 180 people, so not expecting wonderful food. Well, I'd set my sights far too high! Every course was poor, really disappointed. I've eaten here twice before for Xmas do's, both times before the food was SO much better. Staff were good, they always are though.  Onto hotel itself. Beaufiful settings, the manor house is wonderful although not always very clean in the rooms. For a four star hotel , the Norton Park is showing signs of wear and tear and there's also a downright barmy part of its set up. The majority of the rooms are accessed via a sheltered, glass walkway which has a circa three inch gap at its base. So lovely in the summer Absolutely FREEZING in the winter?! Why would any architect in their right mind do that?! It means whenever I've stayed there in the winter, everyone complains that they get frozen on the way over to the hotel proper from their bedrooms?! Crazy.  Back to the staff though. They're always helpful and attentive. I do wish that someone would have a little chat about basic cleanliness (back to the manor) but their hearts are in the right place!  All in all, some great bits, some poor, some barmy. Just a regular haunt in Hampshire then?! 
0; Stayed here 5 nights on buisness room was clean and spacious hotel clean food ( evenings) was good with plenty of choice only problem was the smell of cigarette smoke comin from rooms in first floor they had loads of spanish contractors stayin and they obviously turn a blind eye to the no smoking in these rooms weak managment apart from that everything was ok would stay again if in area 
0; If you want something special and don't mind the prices, then this is a great hotel.  Checking in was hard as we were not given any details about where to find the lift, breakfast room etc.    I would stay again 
0; As the title explains, this hotel is better than average, but nothing you would not expect, bar prices are quite steep! especially as there is a Wetherspoons close by, overall the hotel was clean & tidy, the food was generally good & the ambiance was also good.. 
0; Staying in Manchester on business we wanted to stay in a good quality hotel but away from the large chain operations. The Macdonald Town House is a converted cloth warehouse and turned into a very well appointed 85 room small hotel. The decor is fresh and modern and our spacious executive room was very comfortable and with all essentials provided. So why the lower than perfect marks? This is down to detail and care. Our shower door leaked so the floor mat was soaking post-shower, the breakfast was chaotic, understaffed and though the staff were willing, simply couldn't cope. Our breakfast eggs were overcooked/hard and the buffet needed topping up. Nothing major and all experienced in other hotels around the world from time to time - but in a 'boutique' quite expensive hotel (more then the Raddison Edwardian in Manchester on the night we stayed) a distraction from what should have been a better experience. That said we were offered a discount upon mentioning the issues but again it isn't about money so much as over promising and under delivering. 
0;Very central with friendly staff, near Chinatown and Piccadilly Station a few blocks away. Room comfortable if a bit tired with great views over city. Breakfast area had similar outlook over main square. I would recommend hotel but only downside was the amount of people hanging around doorways and even lying under the ATM begging from passers by. Whilst I feel sorry for these people I just think it detracted from an otherwise ok stay.
0; We were really looking forward to staying on the sunborn. When onboard you will not be disappointed with its old time decorative charms. The lobby has a stunning chandelier and beautiful wood effect panelling.   However, our check in was average, no details on times of services in the restaurants and bar with little information passed across about facilities in the hotel.   We had afternoon tea booked, and whilst the view was amazing on a glorious sunny day, the sandwiches were really dry and curly at the sides, you could tell that they had been sitting around for some time in a fridge before being served.   The restaurant staff were not very attentive, bar staff were better.   I would, recommend staying for the experience but do not have high hopes on food and service. 
0;" Needed to &quot;impress&quot; my new girlfriend with a night away between Christmas & New Year. £108 on &quot;Late Rooms.com&quot; for Superior room, two course meal, breakfast and use of Spa facilities.  Room big & clean and more that adequate. Food in restaurant good, although a bit of confusion as we didn't know we had to make a reservation and had to wait 45 minutes. "
0;We pushed open the door and found ourselves spinning in a time vortex. When the dizziness subsided we found ourselves deep in an English seaside hotel time continuum. The dark pink carpet, hardly worn despite its decades lining the walk to reception and up the stairs, darkened as it neared the skirting boards until the last six inches (metric surely unheard of yet) were blackened by the same decades of dust. The greeting was friendly and we were thrilled to learn that we had been given a “particularly lovely room”, with a partial sea view.  I did the gentlemanly thing and, in two journeys, heaved our cases up and up and up to said “particularly lovely room”. Well, it was large enough but furnished in scuffed, pine furniture featuring a bizarre mock -, pretend-, self-assembly (so best disassembled, I’d say) four poster bed and two round, faded velvet, buttoned chairs. The perfectly clean, softener-smelling towels managed between them to cover every shade of white Dulux could name and we decided, in our time warp, to ignore the shabby paint work, the scuffs on the walls, etc. We couldn’t, however, ignore the caked scum on the shower screen bath seal or the black mildew on the tiles.  Some other reviewers have called the hotel “tired”. I’d say positively exhausted. The pool area is sadly and depressingly industrial – all for the sake of a few pictures on the walls – and the jacuzzi generated as many bubbles as a bottle of flat lemonade. It is a hotel with the potential to be really delightful but it is so, so tired. It must be said that the bathroom was cleaned whilst we were out after our first perfectly decent night’s sleep (demonstrating that it could and should have been done before) without question and with an apology. A shame that the apology didn’t extend to waiving the £3.60 for the one (poor) coffee we had in the bar on our first night, mind you. The breakfast was good but not exceptional, largely plated from a behind-the-scenes keep-hot buffet rather than cooked to order I suspect and all the dining room staff we encountered were particularly good: friendly, attentive, smart and efficient. They are a real highlight of the hotel. The room in which they worked afforded a lovely view of the genuinely beautiful and immaculately tended gardens but, again, it lacked much character as it tried to heave itself out of the 60s and landed somewhere between intricate plaster ceiling roses with chandeliers and contemporary minimalism. Of course, the only fair assessment hinges on value for money. Out of the high season and given its shortcomings I guess £90 a night for bed and breakfast is still not bad but if we had a “particularly lovely room” I have to wonder what the others might be like. If you go, don’t expect quite what you see on the web, and enjoy a nostalgic trip back a few decades. Tired, shabby and grubby in places with nice facilities in need of attention but genuinely lovely dining room staff. From what we could glean the hotel enjoys a high percentage of returners so who am I to complain but I certainly won’t be returning in a hurry and I rather wish I’d read more into the three star rating critiques than I did.
0; The Casterbridge is billed as a hotel but is in fact a bed and breakfast. The location is good in central Dorchester not far from the County Museum. The service is pleasant with a personal greeting and helpful maps provided. The breakfasts are very good with a wide range of fruit and cereals and cooked-to-order main course plus excellent coffee. My single room was small and looking on to the High East Street had traffic noise without double glazing. The walk-in shower was welcome but the toilet flush was inadequate.The price was relatively high - my long weekend of three nights in a single averaged £85 a night (including the ghastly 20% VAT of course).The bed was very comfortable and the TV worked well. The Casterbridge has a well-appointed lounge and pleasant indoor and conservatory seating areas for breakfast. . 
0; Not a bad place and in a central location, however the wifi was ropey and dropped on and off.   Rooms could do with updating as some decor was starting to look tired.   My room had a Nespresso machine, which was great, however the milk was in those tiny jugs and I never had more than 2 or 3 left each night.. and I have that in one coffee!   Didn't feel it was great value for money considering it cost over £200 a night.. not sure if choose to stay again. 
0;" I will start by saying that I had a perfectly satisfying stay as a solo business traveller, getting decent value for money and being pleasantly surprised after reading previous reviews.  Firstly, I can see why this hotel gets such bad feedback - it’s deteriorating condition is NOT worthy of 4* spa hotel status, and standard prices would be far too high to warrant the very average quality of essentials such as showers, decor and general lack of maintenance. Nobody - including the staff - can argue against the whole place needing a refurb.  However, as a solo business traveller I took a risk on booking here - principally due to a large discount, pool/fitness centre and it’s convenience near to the M3 - and actually left satisfied that I’d made the right choice.  Bad news first; whole place needs a clean/refurb (shower, pool, corridors especially), lockers were dirty, restaurant closed at 8.55pm (not 9pm as advertised).  On the plus side: room/bed comfortable, bar pleasant enough (with Sky Sports), duty manager helpful, pool/sauna nice enough, breakfast plentiful (if expensive at £11), parking easy (Friday night), good size TV in room, huge discount.  I know there are other issues such as air con not working in some rooms but I didn’t miss it, light sleepers may have issues with traffic noise and germaphobes might freak out in general. Having stayed in all sorts of hotels in Southeast Asia though it wasn’t a problem to me!  The problem with this place is that people turn up expecting a plush spa hotel experience and are justifiably disappointed. While I wouldn’t bring my wife here for a romantic break, it served it’s purpose perfectly for me as a low maintenance business traveller and I enjoyed a nice swim, decent night’s sleep and adequate food. I stayed in room 253 and paid £45 + £11 breakfast. I know there is some refurb work going on, but I’d suggest unless there are real improvements made soon then anything more than £60 for a room would be pushing it price-wise. "
0; Tylney Hall is a truly stunning location. The grounds are kept beautifully and the building is also lovely. However... the staff are not great. Service is very slow, many of the staff are very young and some have only limited English. Examples are - bar staff openly arguing about how to make a mojito that I had ordered..or having to chase up the fundementals of toast and tea 3 times at breakfast. In fact the breakfast eggs bennedict came from the kitchen faster than I could get my hands on a cuppa. 
0;" You have to remember that the double room including breakfast for two cost less than £60. I was expecting a little better than Travelodge but unfortunately the rooms, hallways and facilities in general were decidedly tired and worn. I do realise it is an old building, at least the facade is, but the actual hotel accommodation part (the but you don't see in their publicity photos) is 70's redbrick function. It really needs an overhaul. Its a shame because it looks like a great location and building from the outside. You might expect it to be old or &quot;character&quot; but i'll fitting and worn out carpets just makes it feel a little unloved.   So all in all an average stay, pleasant, cheap and quiet. "
0;" First impressions were very good, not far from Bath. Friendly receptionist on arrival. Room No 3 in main house, ok if a little dated with odd matching furniture, electric socket lose on wall and odd stains on chimney breast. Toilet was dirty with old worn seat. Booked table in Restaurant for 8.10pm. Firstly given wrong menu, then had to wait 1hr and 5 mins for food to arrive. Ordered side order, this did not arrive till we had finished the meal. Not good enough, especial as Marco himself was staying there on Fri 4th Oct. Offered complimentary drinks but took the shine off our stay. Next Morning ordered Haddock and poached eggs off the Menu for breakfast, only to be told &quot; Sorry No Haddock&quot; What ? this is owned by a Top Chef ! "
0;Stayed here for 1 night and it looks tired,we have stayed in a few Marriott hotels,and the (worsley) Marriott was head and shoulders above,outside needed cleaning and painting,light sockets were broken,sat at the window for tea and couldn't see out as the windows were that dirty,the breakfast was nice but waiting 20 mins for a coffee was a little to long
0;" I have just returned after a couple of days at the Christchurch Harbour Hotel & Spa, my partner wanted somewhere relaxing and somewhere to enjoy some Spa treatments, so here is my honest review of the good and not so good !!!  On the good side first..... this hotel has views to die for !, just so beautiful and relaxing. The rooms are spotlessly clean and attention to detail has been given in it's design and materials used in the bathroom etc. There are plenty of staff and must say, &quot; All seemed happy with a smile on their faces ! &quot; When having a meal, the staff were aware of you, and seemed to appear just at the right times to clear your table, or to see what else you needed without being too overpowering.  Now the not so good !  On arrival, the check-in is just outside the General Managers room, which had it's door opened and inside looked like a disorganised storeroom ! Not a good start. The quality of furnishings in the rooms as I have said &quot; are very good &quot; but the bed is NOT of the same standard, it is comfortable, and possibly the higher end of beds made for the hotel industry, but the top quality of these would only get 4 out of 10 compared with someone like Vi-Spring, and hotels like JFB or even Radisons would NEVER consider using open-coil sprung units in a 4 star premises, so if you ever want that fifth star then you will need to do your research into what real comfortable beds are about ! One of the main reasons for choosing this hotel was because it offered Spa treatments, so having arrived the very first thing we did was to try and book some treatments, only to be told, &quot; Sorry we are fully booked for several days in advance, and unable to offer any during our stay &quot; So my advise is, before booking to make sure you are able to book Spa treatments. When booking on line, you can book with breakfast and evening meal included !!! this is what we did, however then found you have a price limit on the evening meal of £30 which on the face of it, seems fine, until you look at the prices charged for the meals, way, way over the top, so then expect to pay a surcharge of about £10 on each meal.  To give an example for say the starter you wanted King Prawn salad, that's £8.95 and for this you will get it on a large wooden platter and consists of, just a little rocket salad, sauce, and on top of that just ONE king prawn, yes ONE (1) King prawn !!!, be it a large one, but once the head and shell is removed, it is now smaller than ones little finger.  The quality of the food in fairness, is good, the helpings seem to vary with whatever you order, so what the waitresses will do is, fill you up with bread, or else you would be hungry, and here I would add, the bread is fresh and tasty, so it compensates in some small way. The prices of the drinks again are way over the top, a large house red wine, and a double Bacardi & Coke you will get little change out of £20. This hotel has just so much going for it, but let down by the over-the-top prices it charges for it's food and drink, and again if every they want that fifth star, then they would loose it by not giving value for money, and that's what we the customer wants, so rethink here, and believe me by lowering these prices you WILL sell more, and more contented customers ! With breakfast, there is plenty of cereals, fruit, and continental items to choose from, all fresh and tasty, and they also offer a &quot;Full English&quot; and this the area I found the fell down, as when I asked for a Full English less the tomato and Black pudding, when my breakfast arrived, it did not contain these items (great) but it also did not contain my hash brown or slice of bacon, not sure if the fault of the waitress or cook, and similar on other days, so maybe the waitress would be better of at breakfast time with a pre printed list of the Full English and only tick off the items not required, just a thought ! There is an indoor swimming pool, hot tub etc, however on hot days it would be so nice to have an outdoor hot tub to enjoy in the sun, this is not a complaint, but just a thought for the future ! So that's about it, this hotel has just so much going for it, just such a relaxing location, like all people we don't mind paying extra for quality, but to always remember, there is a limit people will pay for quality, as there are a lot more similar places always ready to welcome the business "
0; Rooms are very Hot in Summer - The hotel does have a fan in the room though Breakfast isn't great in terms of quality - it's ok after a night out and there is plenty of it. Had a broken desk lamp in our room - which I reported - but it wasn't fixed during our stay. 
0; Friendly welcoming staff and a clean, decent sized room with a large TV and comfortable bed. Unfortunately my stay was spoilt yet again by the basics - air conditioning not working, and a stingy number of milk cartons provided in the room (why do hotels seek to upset you from the minute you arrive by doing this?!!). Also the lighting in the room was quite dim, including the bathroom (not good on the eyes). 
0; Be careful which room you choose - me and my partner went for a night and were offered the choice of rooms - one at the front - small or larger one at the back - we chose the back for the space, but wouldn't like to spend more than one night there - room was lovely, great shower room and plenty of space but unfortunately cellar man still working at 12.30 am - he then seemed to take a break for a couple of hours and come back with vengeance!!! We had a lovely meal, although portions are huge, perhaps could do with toning down a bit. Breakfast was OK, felt as if we had our moneys worth, but would probably take the smaller room if we stayed again, although bed was very small so probably wouldn't have got much sleep as would have needed to curl up all night - big room at the front of hotel would be a winner!!!! 
0; Lovely building and grounds however, stay was spoilt by the lack of information about the hotel and surrounding area. Staff were very few and far between, did not conduct themselves in a professional manner that you would expect from a 4 star rated hotel. 
0; Just returned from our 3rd stay at Skegness .   we stayed in the GOLD apartments Waves 105. Rooms are getting very tired and the exterior decking /walkways becoming hazardous .Selling these as Gold and charging high prices for short breaks ,Could go on a bit here but wont bother as will probably pop up in the reviews to come.   We were Half board with Premier dining and chose to dine in the Deck Resteraunt. Breakfast has plenty of choice the big issue for myself and listening to many others was the Queues at the omelette/pancake station . 1 guy making 1 omelette at a time and sometimes the queue 10 deep . Evening meal again plenty of choice but again big queues at the burger station 1 person cooking . Overall food choice and taste we found as a Family pretty good.  Entertainment: Was good the Best shows were Alladdin Rocks , Scooby Doo and Ragdolls. The Skyline Gang also put on a good show in the Skyline Pavilion .( beware of the crazy queues that start around 1 hour before the doors open to Centre Stage ) Gets really busy and becomes pretty uncomfortable around the tables as they are so crammed together.  Splash waterworld very good and clean considering its always very Busy.  Funfair outside also good again some of the rides getting past there best . Mostly free of charge (should all be included in price of your break)  Resort itself clean and tidy and Gardens kept well .  Indoors around arcades expensive if you have a few Kids suppose only to be expected . When Characters are out for a short time they are rushed away very quick and found this to be very ignorrant especially when Kids only just see them and the Redcoats wont let them stop for a quick Photo.  Most important thing was our 3 Kids enjoyed there stay. 
0;Celebrated my wife's birthday at HduV in Brighton. Arrived with great expectations after staying at both the Birmingham and Henley hotels. We had booked a suite, and were shown to the SMWS suite and were not disappointed. Staff were very helpful, bar service excellent and dinner was delicious. BUT after going back to the room we were awakened in the early hours (1am) by shouting and obscene language. It was like the windows were open and we could hear everything that was going on in the street below. The noise finally subsided around 4.30am and we eventually went back to sleep. It was terrible and completely ruined what otherwise had been a special day! We mentioned this to the receptionist the next morning and were told that they were aware of the issue and had even replaced the windows to try an eliminate the noise. With a room rate at over £300, this is totally unacceptable.
0; As other reviewers have mentioned this Hotel is in a very good location, 5 minutes walk to Kensington High Street Tube Station.  The lobby and public areas are very much in keeping with a 4 star rating but the rooms are somewhat small and could do with an upgrade. Our room did not smell great but I believe this was down to the fact that the windows do not open. Having the air con on full blast did little to alleviate this problem.  The room was however very clean and was maintained very well.  Breakfast was not a great experience as we felt extremely cramped, with tables very close together and the food on offer was limited but of reasonably good quality.  The staff we encountered were all very friendly and helpful.  We secured a travelzoo deal for £100 a night including breakfast which for this location in London does represent very good value for money.  Whilst not great we would consider staying here again on a similar deal. 
0; First impression not good. Threadbare carpet on the stairs in the front entrance. We stayed in room 11. Very small and basic. There was a constant motor noise throughout our stay from below or to the side of us. This went on right through the night. It was cold in our room. The heating via the air con unit was ineffective however it didn't matter as you cannot have the unit turned on because of the dreadful noise it makes. Likewise the extract fan in the bathroom. We had to knock the master switch off to stop the noise. Cracked tile on bathroom floor and tired furniture in the room. Comfortable bed. We ate at night in the restaurant and it was very good, however we felt that £16 per person for breakfast was too expensive and went elsewhere. Great location. Overall disappointed having read previous reviews. Would stay again but only at heavily discounted rate and ask for another room  
0; On the surface a good hotel but the room was impossibly hot and no evident means to bring the temperature down - so sleeping very difficult. Breakfast was extensive, but none of the 'hot English breakfast' was better than slightly warm, and the fried eggs were rock solid. Attending a conference, and the lunchtime served buffet was all tepid (salmon, vegetables) and poorly put together in terms of the combination. Must try harder as this was best described as a disappointing visit. 
0;Very impressive looking hotel from the frontage but behind the front doors it is starting to look extremely shabby. The reception staff are all very smart in appearance, smiley faces and very polite and obliging. R 89 spacious overlooking the fields, very comfortable, light and airy. The bed linen was very clean but the room was in need of a thorough cleaning. Sadly mould is starting to grow in the bathroom sink and around the bath. Knobs had fallen off the shower and off the back of the bathroom door, where you would hang a bathrobe. White towels were also looking thread bare and in need of replacement. Evening meal very good as was the breakfast the following morning. Again all staff very polite, smart in appearance and obliging.
0; My wife and I have just returned from Middlethorpe Hall. On arrival they could not find our booking and clearly had no awareness of our stay. This begs the question what they would have done if they were full. The old windows rattled all night because of the wind and there was a gap under the door to the room so anyone walking past could be heard clearly, as no doubt we could be in the room. I informed reception of this in the morning and they seemed to care very little that we had had such a poor sleep. We went to the bar before dinner and were greeted by a cocky waiter saying 'Mr and Mrs Stephens, I presume?' We are not the said couple and I really don't know why he felt it appropriate to say that as though he had memorised the names and profiles of the guests. The hotel is very pleasant and the staff are very polite and attentive but for the price that they are asking you can get far better quality. 
0; Stayed here with my other half for a night when travelling down to Hertfordshire. The main building was indeed gorgeous as many other reviewers have said, so too were the extensive grounds. We stayed in a double room on the second floor of the newer annex, which was quite well built/thought out compared to other additions to old buildings I've seen.  The room was clean and large, with large king size comfortable bed. The ensuite bathroom was quite a nice size and had a bath and walk in shower which was a nice touch. The shower door though was impossible to shut as ironically a rubber seal on the bottom (there I presume to stop leaks) kept it jammed open so the floor got quite wet. We had a good view of the grounds to the rear.   We used the spa facilities before dinner, and the pool was quite a good size for a hotel pool, maybe 20m. However the rest of the spa looked rather tired. The steam room or sauna, I can't remember which, was out of order, as was the Jacuzzi. The 'Experience Shower' seemed to have only two settings, on and off, and was quite fusty smelling. I would also have expected some decent refreshments facility, but all that was on offer was a water fountain, producing tepid water.   On deciding to move on and have a pre-dinner drink, we tried to find a bar in the atmospheric old hall, to our dismay we were told the bar in the hall only opens Friday and Saturday, so we had to go back to the brasserie, which was in the newer annex and lacked majorly in atmosphere. We decided to take our drinks right back out to the main patio at the front of the hall.   We did at first book a table for dinner at Crewe Hall but as I've mentioned, the brasserie had so little atmosphere (could easily have been a city centre Novotel) that we decided against it, favouring a local gastropub instead.   We did have a night cap on our return to the hall and asked if it could be brought to us in one of the more beautiful drawing rooms and the staff were more than happy to get our drinks up from the Brasserie bar.  Breakfast the next morning was a standard affair, plenty on offer, continental meats, cooked breakfast, pastries, fruit, cereals. Quality was good but bizarrely they charge extra if you dare to want scrabbled eggs (?)   So, staff very helpful,and friendly but no five star rating from me, the spa needs attention, and they are missing a trick with the facilities available to them, having no option but to eat and drink at the brasserie when you have such a stunning hall with numerous elegant and inviting drawing rooms, library etc, just put us off. I would go again, but wish they would use the hall more! 
0;Stayed here Last Saturday ( low season rate ) in a standard room costing £175.00 for one night, pricey but sounded great. It has a 4* rating and does have great staff but unless you spend twice that don't expect a 4* room !  There is a hotel DVD library, which would be good if the room had a player, no fridge, no aircon and terrily hot, small room and tiny bathroom which only one person can fit in at once. Attention to detail poor, cheap low enegy bulbs poking out of the top of low trendy lamps are not acceptable no matter what you pay. Squeeze past a kettle balanced on a book shelf! The veiw is great if you keep your head and eyes upwards to see the tops of the boats and the hills, lower them and you get a pretty grim car park. Sleap was impossible with the heat in the room in November, a bed like a rock and the thickest polyester duvet we have seen! On check out they asked if everything was ok. We mentioned this and they said the hotel was awarded 4 stars as other rooms had the facilities, and our room was to be refurbished soon. Not much use to us!  Next time we will try the many great looking private rentals with loads of space for the same price or less.
0;I arrived at the hotel on the 27th December 2014, great location-close proximity to Gatwick south terminal. Check in was hassle free and the rooms were Marriott standard- clean, spacious and comfortable.   I would however not recommend the 'Grill' restaurant inside the hotel, the quality of food was very average when compared to its price, in my opinion it was way too overpriced for the level of service and quality of food.   That said, I would however recommend this hotel for an over-night stopover, its comfortable but do not expect any frills!
0; Needs some TLC I stayed one night for a business meeting the room was small but again tired the bathroom door had holes in it where Iam guessing there was once some hooks the bath had some black mould around it in this day there is no need for that a little more care when cleaning will make the difference. The reception staff were not the friendliest bunch. The restaurant staff were a little better the restaurant manger was very good the food was average and over priced. Ok for a one night business trip I would not recommend for families or for a leaguer trip. Lots of parking it has a gym and pool bug I never used them so can't comment on the facilities. 
0; We have stayed down brighten a few times, and there are NOW better smaller hotels dotted around town  The whole place including the rooms need a make over, there still sitting in the 90s, This is not a cheap hotel, and for the price you expect better.  channels 1-5 only in the rooms, room service was VERY VERY DEAR! and a shower CURTAIN in the rooms, looks cheap  I wouldn't book again, id stay down the road in a cheaper but better hotel 
0;It started off well, as it's really easy to find on the Barnet bypass, and has a big car park - after being stuck on the M25, I was really happy about that. It looked quite swanky in the dark when lit up, so had high hopes. First issue - there was no-one on reception - had to wait several minutes for someone to turn up, but when they did, check-in was swift. I had a room on the Mezzanine, so went past the well appointed bar, and up a short staircase. The room was tired to say the least - an old style CRT TV that had screen burn, very marked walls, a damaged shower control and the most ridiculous A/C control I've ever used (you don't set a temperature, you adjust from a median). The room as also sitting at 29 degrees when I got there. so it felt like the room fee was literally going up in smoke! The extractor fan was extremely noisy too. Despite that, the room was clean, and I did sleep well. The bar was good, did not get chance to try the restaurant in the evening, but breakfast was overcooked. It served a purpose, i.e. a quick stopover before a business meeting nearby early the next day - but would not stay their out of choice. The agency I booked through claimed that the rooms were last refurbished in 2009 - if mine was, they got ripped off :(
0; Man on reception, Adrian? not sure but he was charming, a real pro, seriously really nice! Not a Basil Fawlty in sight!  But... Room was ok, bathroom had heating on even though 22 degrees outside! No way to turn it off as all taps were broken so had to leave window open all night which was not pleasant as air-con units outside kept rattling all night.   Don't expect much sleep but there proximity to the town is great and it is fairly cheap. Quick tip - if you find a rate on laterooms try the hotel directly as they might be cheaper and were for us. 
0; The Bell Hotel is an old building and retains much of it's original feel. The restaurant though is in The Bell public house on the opposite side of the road. The rooms are clean but not overlarge to say the least. The bathroom was tiny. The small wash-basin had a glass shelf covering it and it was not possible to rinse your face without butting your forehead on the shelf. The other rooms were the same by all accounts. Good, friendly staff and the breakfast was most acceptable. Very good for a one night stay. 
0;This is a lovely refurbished hotel, the views are good the refurbishment excellent and the staff aren't bad. But that's as far as it goes, we had breakfast which was not the best except the price, when asked how would you like your eggs? You'd think you were going to get 2 (wrong) same thing with the bacon and you've guessed it the same with the toast half a slice and half a crust. Well for £9.00 I was expecting 2 of each (wrong).  But the venue was nice so I was persuaded to have dinner there, so we reserved a table and when we arrived there were more things on the mains list that were not available than there were that were available. As with breakfast the portion were mean, I can only presume they wanted to recover the refurbishment costs ASAP. Don't tell me it's fine dining therefore the portions are smaller, we had lunch at a Michelin restaurant at the London Hilton last week and didn't leave still feeling ravenous and everyone have to accept a second or third choice. If the management can get their act together this could be a really great hotel and restaurant, it's all there they just need to pull it together and they'd have a 5 star review.
0; Pretty soulless place hotel but good for its main purpose - golf. I wouldn't recommend it for a relaxing weekend break if you don't play golf.  It is clean and comfortable. But it doesn't go the extra mile - the room key system is temperamental and the room heating not fully functioning. 
0;" Quality is good across the board, so nothing to complain about here. So it then all depends on how much you like the particular Mal style. For me, there's too much trying too hard to be clever or different - do you really want your shampoo to say &quot;The best shampoo you've ever stolen&quot; - ok, fine with a little bit of this stuff, but I found it overdone, seemed to be everywhere. Lots of very dark decoration, especially in the bedroom, and very harsh (trendy?) lighting. You can't open the bedroom window, so you are a prisoner of the (slightly noisy, but I'm very allergic to this) AC which stopped working in the middle of the night during my stay. Very good food for dinner in the restaurant, and good buffet lunch over our business meeting - much better than usual in a hotel of this level. The house wine was good (like the shampoo it has to have a clever name - &quot;plonk&quot; something or the other) "
0; Nice location, and convenient for the M25 . Staff polite and helpful but be aware that I could only get bar meals on Sunday evening, despite being told I could use the restaurant during check-in. Bar food was quite tasty and well presented though, so this was no great hardship, and the bar was comfortable and had a homely feel. Room was clean and tidy but very compact, so watch you don't knock your elbows, especially in the bathroom. Overall, the hotel was reasonable value for one, but the room would not have been good (for anything other than an overnight stay) for two. 
0;Stayed in this hotel over the Valentines Weekend, the hotel was ok and its location is quite handy for getting on/off the motorway. When we arrived we were not greeted very well and that was how the rest of the stay went. The breakfasts were ok and the room was as expected, except that the sockets were hanging off the walls, probably not a good thing if you have tiny children. Would avoid staying again as definitely NOT a four star.
0; I had always wanted to stay at this hotel as it looked a lot like st martins lane in terms of style so I checked in here on Saturday with high hopes. However once I got to my room my heart sunk, the first thing that struck me was how dark and dingy the room felt, due no doubt to it being in the basement! Also the decor was very tired and dowdy, I'm sure this room looked great years ago but now it just looked and felt old.  I had booked and paid for an executive room with a bath but my bathroom only had a shower, I didn't bother to complain about this as it is not a huge issue for me but it may be for someone else so check first if you really do require a bathtub  Another problem was that I had no 3G signal on my phone ( basement location again ) I paid £20 for WiFi which wasn't the best either and only gave intermittent signal strength   I had a good sleep as the bed was very comfortable and I opted for express checkout to avoid the huge queues at reception in the morning but still had to queue anyway to have my car park ticket validated before I could retrieve my car from the hotel car park so that defeats the object of an express checkout!!  Overall I would rate this hotel as disappointingly average 
0;Long weekend to break up the Christmas period with my girlfriend. Room didn't have main light so was very dark. Hotel looks a bit tired from the outside. Took a full day to fix a broken shower. Staff were saving grace in that they were all super professional and courteous.
0;" We spent 2 days at this hotel over the spring bank holiday. The first impressiions were favourable. It was set in beautiful grounds and were welcomed by a friendly receptionist.  However this friendly rerceptionist's reply to simple questions was almost totally incomprehensible. But no matter our executive room was very nice. The bar area is a little spartan with no really comfortable seatinmg area and we were surprised that the spa area was accessed through a car park and was no more thjan a David Lloyd/Esporta type sports centre. We had booked the half board upgrade at £20 pp which proved to be very good value.The food at dinner and breakfast was good although the breakfast buffet (for cereals, juice etc only) was somewhat spartan, the selection of meats and cheeses consisted of a dish of &quot;Babybells&quot; only. Service was by young, clearly undertrained staff. On our second day we went out, returning at about 3pm to find that our room had not been cleaned, according to one of the housekeeping staff it was not on her list and not her fault. When cleaning finally did take place no soap had been lefft and we were shocked to later find a horribly torn towel which no housekeeper should ever allow to be placed in any room.  Unfortunataly the weather was awful during our stay which did not help. This is a hotel which could be so good but we left feeling disappointed, the assistant manager to whom we spoke before we left was sympathetic but we got the impression that he would not take the matter any further. So rather a let down all round. Not terrible but we have no inclination to go back. "
0; Aircraft noise lets the room down as does the prices in the restaurant. The hotel and room decor and amenities are good though, and friendly staff. Hhonors members are treated well with nice thought out gifts. 
0; hotel was ok for the price, no major concerns but for what i concider central london prices there are much better hotels. location ok 10 min taxi to centre attractions close to tube local dining etc very limited  staff were amazing tho couldn't be more helpfull!  parking usefull aswell room quite basic a little smaller than i would hope from previous marriott visits 
0; Promised so much from the web site. Arrived Wednesday afternoon, staff very friendly and welcoming. We were shown the room and I must admit I was disappointed, not as big as I would have liked but a comfortable bed. We booked in for an evening meal and were impressed with the inside of the pub, I ordered the duck which came with two rosti's. I asked for the duck to be pink, it wasn't and both rosti's were burnt. The strange thing was, just after I had my meal delivered, the rosti's were taken off the menu.  My wife also had issues with the housekeeping, the cleaners hadn't dusted properly, the extractor fan was covered in a buildup of dust and there was a strange stain on the quilt cover. Found a nice pub close by though 
0; This hotel had the basics, but for the price I expected a little more attention to detail. The bowls at breakfast for cereals, cold fruit and yoghurt were all warm from the dishwasher which made the yoghurt curdle (a basic thing which really bugs me) and the butter was completely unspreadable which destroyed the bread. Very dissapointing. 
0; Received a warm welcome at checkin and asked if we want breakfast for an extra £10 and job done. Rooms were on the 2nd floor so you have the choice of the lift or stairs up.  The room was huge, featuring a double and single bed, TV, free wifi, window facing out towards the nice looking grounds, separate bathroom with bath and shower.  A good hotel is defined by a comfortable bed, hot shower and food. Unfortunately the bed was more spring than mattress so didn't sleep very well and the shower was a regularly stoping hot trickle when other guests turned their showers on.  The bar area is comfortable and offers a good choice of drinks and the bar menu is quite extensive. We ordered a couple of steaks, a pudding and a couple of drinks. Service was good and food was tasty and polished off quickly.  Breakfast and buffet choice was quite reasonable with good coffee so ticks the food box well.  But in the end, the hotel was let down by an uncomfortable bed and poor shower.   
0; I booked the hotel over 3 months ago for 2 rooms with accommodation for two adults and a child as we were going to the 02 to see disney on ice.  I have top level status (Spire Ambassador) in ihg group, so generally expect some recognition of loyalty.  However on arrival the rooms were not ready or made up, the check in took 15 minutes whilst reception faffed around, and when I was finally allocated the rooms they were on the second floor overlooking the carpark - so probably the worst rooms in the hotel. I tried to ring down to the hotel to ask for the sofa beds to be made up for the kids but the phone didn't work. I went to reception and politely asked the lady to ask housekeeping to sort the beds. She told me they had been done ...and it took me three attempts to convince her that actually my eyes do work and they absolutely were not made up.  I then politely enquired why I had not received any recognition for spire status or an upgrade and was told that as this was a family room they can't upgrade to a better room. I reminded her that they have rooms with 2 double beds which would have been fine, and she then backtracked but said they were fully booked, which was another lie. I then said even if that was true then usually I get fruit/ or water or access to the lounge. I received nothing, but the beds were made up and the phone fixed. There were no gowns or slippers in the room. The pool / spa is a good facility Breakfast was fine albeit trying to get a member of staff to understand what an earl grey tea is was a challenge.  Location is great for cable cars and dlr  Bar was lovely and a good atmosphere  All in all it was fine once we got the rooms made up correctly - just not as welcoming or prepared as the many other group hotels I have visited.  I've booked a different hotel for my next visit to the O2 
0; Despite having stayed at this particular venue many times, I have never quite understood WHY (for example) Hilton STILL persist in charging clients (HONORS or otherwise) for internet access? Even Premier Inn allow 30 minutes free & McDonalds unlimited free access!! Surely there is a compromise here? Other than that, the services (Restaurant & Bar are too expensive & of questionable quality. We ate dinner at the N. Terminal SOFITEL as it is much better in both aspects. Sharpen up HILTON!!! 
0; The town of Lewes is very nice but after initial checking in the hotel was generally disappointing for our average room rate of £190 plus parking, on their own forecourt.  The room was large and spacious but quite dreary and lacking in detail. The only drawer was floor level under a very decrepit wardrobe. No others in the room at all. :It means you are living out of your suitcase so we do not recommend for more than one night.  There was damp staining on the wall around the window, the room door handle was loose, there was a glass top missing from one of the units, the window blinds did not black out properly causing us to wake up early in the morning and the windows were wedged with paper to stop them rattling. The main problem however was that when the rooms were carved up to add bathrooms little thought was given to sound insulation and we were woken several times in the night by the guests next door coughing or using the toilet.  Food in the restaurant was pleasant but we were unnecessarily place in a pokey corner position when other tables were available. With one chair facing a blank it reminded us of being in the naughty corner at school. There was a vase of dead flowers decorating the table.   We passed on all these points to the duty manager Elliot after our first night and he promised to look into everything for us. Needless to say we never heard anything further, not even a complimentary glass of wine with the hotels apologies.  We won't be going back to Pelham House. 
0;" Came here for a birthday treat for mine and my girlfriends birthday. Really looked forward to a spa break in a spa hotel as I've never been to one.   Hotel We arrived early and was given a lovely greetings at reception. As our room wasn't ready yet we were told to have a a drink in the bar and our spa bags would be given to us whilst we waited.   Our room was ready before the bags arrived so we went upstairs, due to it being both our birthdays were given a complimentary upgrade to the room which was amazing. The room itself was huge!!! Lovely comfy beds, spacious bathroom and excellent facilities. Slept very well, in quiet rural surroundings. We had booked a package with some strawberries and champagne which were also hand delivered to our room, with &quot;happy birthday&quot; written in chocolate with the strawberries. Really really nice personal touch!!   The food at the hotel was fantastic. Dinner was really great tasting, excellently presented and perfect variety. Highly recommend coming here just for the restaurant in the evenings. And breakfast had a nice selection of continental buffet or cooked, or both!! Brilliant way to end our stay.   Spa The &quot;spa experience&quot; was the bit that let me down. The hotel should be advertised as a hotel due to the fact to hotel and spa aren't one unit. You had a short walk down the road to a Bannatynes health club, took the feel of a personal spa experience away as it was open to the public and gym members. To prepare for the spa you has to use gym changing rooms (hardly relaxing). The swimming pool was moderately small, with a jacuzzi that seated no more than 10 comfortably, sauna, steam room and 2 outdoor hot tubs that weren't working. I was majorly let down by this as the idea of a spa is you can relax at your own pace and not having to deal with &quot;regular&quot; gym goers. Such a shame.   The actual spa is a small area set aside in the health club which was nice. Relaxing music and the massage and facial we both had was brilliant, carried out professionally and really incorporated relaxation. We were offered free drinks and use of the heated stone loungers after our massage too.   Overall the spa break was good but left disappointed. I wouldn't return as there are many other spa hotels that are all in ones that offer a better experience in my eyes. Such a shame as the hotel was amazing!! "
0;"It 's a good location with easy access to the main city centre attractions. There is a good cafe nearby called 8 Cafe for snacks at a reasonable price. Check in was easy and the receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the room smelt of cigarettes so we went back to the main desk to request a change of room. I was disappointed that the response was; &quot;well that's a non smoking floor&quot; and then no apology. However the new room was clean and decor was, as you would expect from a Hilton. We didn't use the pool or the evening restaurant so I can't comment. We did use the bar, a little on the pricey side but it's a nice bar and the service was good. My only issue regarding the bar, is that the 10% service charge is added onto the bill automatically although it is DISCRETIONARY. Therefore you need to specify the amount to be paid without tip. It's not that I don't tip but I much rather hand cash to the person serving me (which I did, as the service was good) rather than it go into the corporate accounts (to be given out later). The breakfast was buffet style, very well organised and the selection was very good. Again the staff were very polite and friendly."
0; Stayed for two nights in a deluxe king size room. The hotel is well located, only a one minute walk from Edgware Road tube station, and access to plenty of eateries on Edgware Road.  Upon arrival we were delighted to receive early check-in and a room upgrade to a deluxe room on a higher floor from a friendly receptionist. We experienced great customer service throughout our stay.  The room was a bit shabby compared to most Hilton's we have previously stayed in. The tap in the bathroom was broken, and there was an issue with condensation on the room window, meaning it was difficult to see the view out to the city (don't go for a deluxe room just for the view).  The biggest disappointment was the ongoing renovation works at the hotel. On arrival we enquired about the work, and were reassured that the work would be completed between 9 and 5 - as stated on the hotel website. However both days, the work started at 8, and finished well after 5. The work is loud - lots of drilling and hammering, and woke us up both days. The final morning we were then told by a receptionist that 'sometimes' the work starts from 8.....? So we were lied to by both the staff and the company website.  The completed renovation looks great, and would stay again, but only once the work has been fully completed. Would suggest to avoid the hotel until the end of the renovation. 
0; Arrived Friday around 630pm so there was a queue for checkin which thinned reasonably quickly after a second receptionist was summoned - it was open weekend at York University so the Hotel was busy plus the weather was excellent and there was also a wedding on the Satuday.  This was my wife's birthday weekend in York and the hotel was booked via Marriott points earned from my Marriott business stays.   We were allocated a room to the front of the hotel and it was fine if a little tired and noisey from the road - the bed was a bit lumpy, a bulb had to be replaced in the bathroom, the blind in the bathroom wouldn't go up and had some marks on it from wear and tear plus the Georgian doors were quite dusty/dirty and the air conditioning made a noise but didn't cool the room that much.  After a great breakfast at Betty's in York on the Saturday plus some shopping with my wife we got back to the hotel at 330pm and our room hadn't been made up which wasn't great so we got housekeeping to sort and went for a trip out.  We didn't eat at the hotel and got the bus into York from across the road in the main.  The reception staff were great and we had a great weekend in York but I would have been disappointed if I had had to pay for the room plus it put us off eating there as well - I expect better from Marriott. 
0; I have stayed in nearly all of the shire hotels so I had high expectations for this one. It's a shame it didn't live up to the high levels of service I have seen in the others. Far from a moan but worthy of comments as I know this chain appreciate all feedback.  A pleasant and quick check in, although it took some time to link the stay to the affinity membership. The room was as expected although no iron, milk or the takeaway coffee cups which is always a plus in the others I have stayed in. That said for a nights stay I wasn't too bothered.  I always eat in this group of hotels, the food is always superb as it also was this time but the restaurant service was poor at best. Arriving at the table I felt 'shoved in' anywhere, I ordered a dish from the nibbles menu and a main. The main was served and then I sat there for what seemed like forever. I would have ordered another drink with my meal and maybe a dessert but no-one seemed interested, to the point where I decided to give up and go to the bar. I approached a waitress but she made it clear she was too busy to help but did send someone else across.  I asked to pay, hoping for the opportunity to respond to that normal question of 'was everything okay', but no, didn't get a chance. For some reason I wasn't charged for the bar drink I took in to the restaurant but I did pay mention it and did pay for this at the bar.  It seems petty I guess to bother writing about the service, but I've stayed so often in Shires that I specifically chose this hotel despite my next day meeting being in central Manchester - purely because of the excellent service I had got used too.   Aside from also being directly under the Manchester airport flight path, everything else about the place was great, although I wont choose here again. 
0;Came here for an industry awards night (we won!) which was a great night but hotel was nothing special. Decent location just around corner from Gloucester Rd tube and quick friendly check in. Room was ok but nothing special, a bit basic really. Old bathroom that needed a freshen up and draught coming through windows even though they were closed? Had to pay for wifi too which is a joke. Room did have tea and coffee facilities but a pointless empty mini bar? Meal can't be commented on as there were 350 rammed into a function room but brekkie was good with loads of choice and a really good English breakfast. Casino next door is dangerous after a few beers! Had a business meeting in coffee bar too and that was very comfortable. Ok but nowt special
0; Stayed at Callow Hall one night including dinner and breakfast. The staff seemed young and inexperienced but helpful and pleasant.  We had booked a four-poster bed room which had the most awful silver painted four poster ( all down to taste I suppose -or lack of !!) totally out of character for a country house hotel. The general feel was of a hotel looking a bit tired (not faded grandeur). The food and service in the dining room was good. This is meant to be a true reflection of my impression of the place and although it may seem negative I would stay aagain 
0; The Lion is lovely pub. It's been very tastefully decorated and I felt very relaxed here. The staff were very warm and friendly, I couldn't fault the service at all. The food is also beautifully presented, fresh and cooked very well but it just lacked flavour. I tried 3 dishes and they all failed to deliver anything above average. The menu isn't very adventurous either.  Overall the experience was good, but as the most important thing for me was missing I left a little disappointed. Having said that, I would go again as I realise that one experience may not necessarily be a true reflection of what they can deliver.  
0; The hotel is worth it's 4 stars, with stylish rooms and good food. The building is attractive and set in nice grounds on Mt Ephraim.  That said, the 'spa' is not really a spa. There's a small (15m) swimming pool, a gym, a steam room and a sauna. That's it. No jacuzzi, outdoor spa etc. Furthermore, there were no robes or slots available all weekend for any treatment! The whole 'spa' area feels like a council run swimming pool.  The restaurant manager also didn't know what was on his wine list. 
0; Visited this hotel with friends having previously visited the De Vere hotels at Carden Park, Belton Woods and Dunston Hall in the past 12 months or so and quite frankly had Oulton Hall been our first experience of De Vere we wouldn't have bothered with the others. The room was satisfactory,although, as mentioned elsewhere, the decor is tired and the bathroom really needed a deep clean because the tiling was grubby and the mastic beading around the bath had gone black with age. Nevertheless, clean towels were provided each of the 3 days of our visit and our room was tidied and the bed made. Unfortunately, our friends could not say the same after their room was missed by the chambermaid and was still not made up that day even though the omission was reported to reception. Our booking was for dinner bed and breakfast. This worked out at about £200 per couple per day which was a little more than what we had paid for a similar package at the other venues but perfectly acceptable. What was not acceptable was the choice of main courses on the set menu that was available under the deal we had booked. The choices on the set menu every day were coley, belly pork or a vegetarian option which were available without any vegetables other than potato. Vegetables and/or salad could be purchased separately, however, at an additional cost of approximately £4 per item. Possibly, many guests may have welcomed these choices of main course but we really didn't fancy any of them and decided to go 'a la carte'. Not one of the choices on the 'a la carte' was near the allowance give in lieu of the cost of the set menu and again the vegetables or salad had to be purchased at extra cost and without gravy the meal was dry so it was necessary to purchase sauce to aid digestion. To gild the lily, the portions for all of the courses were comparable with the bad days of the 'nouvelle cuisine' era which has, thankfully, largely disappeared elsewhere,even at other De Vere venues where we have often enjoyed an uncomplicated carvery. Hopefully for future visitors to other De Vere venues Oulton Hall is not a sign of what is to come. Others have commented on the price of the drinks in previous reviews and have even recommended using the pub at the entrance to the grounds. Whilst, not going that far, the management should consider that excessively high prices alienate visitors, Perhaps, the prices are aimed at the many wedding guests and hen parties who only stayed for the evening or possibly overnight but again you have to wonder if even they would return. There are other negative issues, such as Oulton Hall being the only De Vere golf venue where the points on a De Vere golf club card cannot be used on a Friday - needless to say the golf club membership will not be renewed even though this means writing off some 100 points but no doubt this won't cause the local management of this particular venue to lose too much sleep. The overall feeling, is that we were there for three days and the hotel was going to make as much as possible out of us which is very disappointing given the optimism with which we looked forward to the break after our previous experiences with the group. 
0;" The castle is gorgeous as are the beautifully kept grounds. The problems though are more subtle. We were &quot;upgraded&quot; to the Tower Room. The Tower Room is 91 steps up. There is no lift. The room itself was rather small but the bed was comfortable and the amenities well-chosen. However, once in the room the thought of walking down all that way and walking UP again became burdensome. We were not consulted about this &quot;upgrade&quot; and when we asked if there was another room available were told that the Castle was fully booked. Furthermore upon our leaving I asked to have a porter carry down our large and heavy suitcase. After waiting for a10 minutes, I went down to the car ( with other luggage) and waited there. 20 minutes later we were still waiting. I went into the reception area and asked where our bags were. The woman at the front desk said: oh they're just there sir. We were wondering what happened to you. Given that we were parked right outside the door the porter or someone could've looked for us- instead we were kept waiting for no other reason than staff apathy. This should have been a happy experience and it wasn't. "
0; This was our fourth visit in about seven years and in all that time I dont think they have put a   coat of paint on the accomodation blocks.First impressons count and the stairways up to the first flor didn’t impress.Green mould on top of r otting wood and flaking paintwork was the last thing we wanted to see after spending £800 on a bank holiday break.Toe nails and fungi on the carpet wasn’t the other things either.They did come and clean the carpet when told about the mould growing behind the door and they were very apologetic, as for the nail it was found when we were ready for leaving so didn’t bother reporting it. After spending a lot of money on the new pool area it’s a pity they have let the accomodation go downhill. The entertainment and food was up to usual standard,we were in the coast dining room and the staff there were very good.Always a smile and a little chat     entertainment and food was up to the usual standard. We were in the Coast dining room and the staff there were very good,always got a smile and ready to have a little chat to you. Will leave it a couple of years before we go back in ,the mean time        entertainment and the food was up to the usual standard as usual 
0; Booked this hotel with my free spire Elite club member points and due to the location. I may sound a bit of a snob with this review, but as part of my membership I was extremely disappointed with my stay. Room and bathroom was very small and in need of TLC. My bathroom In the Crowne Plaza was bigger than this room. I did comment on social media to be told they would be happy to upgrade me to a bigger room. Just a little bit too late always been happy with the Crowne Plaza chain before but won't be stopping here again. On the upside I'm glad I didn't have to pay for that room 
0; I've stayed here a few times and whilst I've never chosen it for the food the breakfast is excellent. Only a few minutes walk to Hyde Park and 15 mins to Oxford St it's highly recommended for connecting with Paddington Station and the Heathrow Express. 
0; The welcome after a 250-ish mile by reception, very poor...it was as though the parents had asked the daughter to work on reception at the weekend! (We're not claiming this was the case, but it had the same vibe!!) so this, personally was very disappointing, especially as this wasn't a cheap getaway! The room service however, was second to none...kitchen staff were great!  That aside, great hotel, fantastic decor, clean and children friendly... It has a play area, whilst we didn't use the facility, it was nice to know it was there. We have a 2.5 year old.   There's a local chippie which make everything fresh, this is approx. 5min away. There's also a local beach area, not to far from the chippie.   The place is very quite with not much to do...however, we took the opportunity to venture out..so over the 3 days we visited Lands End (Beautiful with a lovely farm) Truro, St. Ives, Penzance, Newquay....and to finish of the stay, we went to The Eden Project, we've always wanted to go and it wasn't a let down! Well recommended!!  The drive to and from the hotel is great too, taking you through small and whiney roads...  We hope the above insight is helpful... We've tried to be as fair as possible.  Enjoy. :-)   
0;Stayed in room 135, no bedside reading light, no ceiling light or table lamp or arm chair. Therefore unable to read. Breakfast very good. Arrived at 1530 and no room available so possible why were placed in room 135.
0; too much cost for very little in return room very tired and needs a good overhall,lack of simple maintanace task done ie shaver socket stuck on with silicon and not even straight.window sills don't even meet window frame lack of tea making stuff ie 2x teabags 2x coffee and in some sugar bags only a few grains of sugar in them 
0; Look I flew into LHR with my brother and his 11 months old baby girl plus his 3 year old direct from SYDNEY, The hotel was great, the food awesome, but the bar shuts at 00:00 which is awful, sorry but if you check in at 11 and just about sort yourself out a two drink minimum is a requirement, and no not even alcoholic beverages were available outside our room, also and this is VERY, VERY important if your bringing the kids like we did as our mum is sick and my brothers wife unable to travel, there is NOTHING For the kids, no play area, no indoor software play area and a spa which we did not see as it opens at 8 meaning that the several hundred dollars plus spent of a room really was not worth it...Look you this is the UK but five star hotels globally and at all major hubs other than in Britain are very much on the ball with this, yes I stayed there in May, with the kids but even as an adult staying on my own due to the lack of limited services for late night or early morning I would think twice before staying there again.....however to be fair if you're there for business, this hotel is pretty dam perfect. 
0;My wife and I have just returned from a three night stay at Armathwaite Hall and there are certainly a lot of positives about the venue. Unfortunately there are also some negatives that led to our three star rating. Positives. The setting is quite stunning with fantastic views from the Lake restaurant and the bar area with lovely grounds. The Brasserie bar was nice with good quick service nice food and an equally nice atmosphere. Spa also very nice according to my wife. The clay pigeon shooting was also excellent and the instructor was a lovely chap and a very good teacher. The food in the Lake restaurant was absolutely superb. Negatives. As a wedding venue I would highly recommend this place. Unfortunately, as a none wedding guest my wife and I felt we received some second class service whilst the staff were busy pandering to the wedding arrangements. On the first evening we thought we would have a pre-dinner drink in the bar area and waited twenty minutes to be asked whether we would like a drink by which time we only had ten minutes before our dining reservation and had to refuse the offer. Given the fact that we were the only people in the bar this was unacceptable. The same afternoon a large wedding party took over the front lawn making it impractical to sit on the bar terrace in the lovely sunshine. The next day we went to sit on the terrace and, again, were not asked whether we would like a drink. Worse still when I attempted to go inside to order at the bar, I found that the door had been shut behind us as they were setting up for another small wedding party! The same evening there was nobody at all behind the bar and we had to ask at reception to be served! On our final evening we gave the bar another try only to find again that there was nobody there. When a staff member did appear she told us that she could not serve as she worked in the restaurant. Fair enough but it would have been nice if she had added that she would go and get someone to serve us. As a lot of staff were Eastern European I felt there was often a little lack of communication. In addition to the poor service in the bar the corridors to the spa rooms could do with a bit of an update. Finally, although our room was nice it could have done with a thorough dust and the carpet was covered in dog hairs. Also the TV in the bathroom was faulty and was not repaired for the duration of our stay despite us reporting it within a couple of hours of our arrival. So, if you are considering the place as a wedding venue then I think it would be superb. However, on the basis of the comments above, I could only rate it three star.
0; Went to a medical conference and the location was alright. The check in and out were fine but we had a problem with AC, location of the room and noise of staff access doors adjacent to our room. Cleanliness was an issue too. Relatively average prices. 
0; I remember when this hotel was being built and it was a real destination hotel in Newcastle but the years haven't been too kind. For what we paid, just over £100 you really cannot complain and the on-site parking for £7 a night was an absolute bonus but I expect more from a 4 star hotel. We did get a lovely large room and it seemed like it had been partially renovated in recent times, the carpets and wallpaper were new but didn't therefore match the curtains which were also falling apart. The bathroom was okay but there were cracked tiles and it was jaded. The minibar was empty and there was no safe - I didn't ask reception about these so it may be they could have been remedied but it wasn't particularly important to us for a one night stay. The reception and bar staff were helpful enough although the prices in the bar were eye watering. We chose not to eat breakfast in the hotel and instead walked 50 yards along to Wetherspoons. Frustratingly there was no 3G signal (O2) and as we were the organisers of the weekend that caused a few minor issues. Overall we would stay again as the location and price were very good but the hotel itself was only adequate. 
0;Feedback,   Few small things make a big difference!!  I was celebrating my wife's 40th birthday party and came into the hotel early to drop off 2 bottles of Presseco so the hotel staff could place the bottles in the room fridge or in a bucket so when I arrived later I could pour a cold glass as we got into the room!!! This was not done not was it explained downstairs that if I did not swipe my card I would not have access to the fridge.   The staff did apologise after and send a ice bucket but the moment was lost and really it clouded my expectations. Understand I live 4 miles from the hotel so the investment was made came with a certain level of expectation hence me being so disappointed from the start.   In addition there was a misunderstanding with the room I booked because when I spoke to the person who took my booking she explained I was getting a suite room (which I know has a bath) but when I arrived the lady at reception told me it was an executive suite which did not have a bath. Again another small point but this is the first evening we have had away from the kids in over a year and my wife loves a bath. The agent who took my booking should not have uphold me and mismanaged my expectations.   PS: I have stayed at your hotel over 6 times with work so know the facilities well during my time at a local company and have always liked the hotel and was happy with the service.   
0; Stayed here for the weekend a lovely hotel had a comfordable room very dated but it was clean and comfordable the pillows where a little flat but we got free wi fi. Breakfast was very poor the room is so dark and hot and it took for ever to replenish breakfast items you almost feel you sat on top of each other . Staff where very welcoming and friendly except the breakfast staff who did not look to happy to be there . 
0;Do not eat in the restaurant as the service and standard of the food is awful. The Manager could not care less and this totally ruined our planned weekend. To top it all be careful of the pre-authorisation on your credit / debit card as they do not release the funds upon check out and we are still chasing the money 5 days later.
0;" Ideally situated for a trip to the Hammersmith Eventime Theatre the rooms were small, the bed a double apparently, was only a small double, two larger people would struggle for room. Our room was overlooking the&quot; High Street&quot; and you could hear all the vehicle movements and people outside even through the double glazing as if there was a window open. The room was clean and tidy and had all mod cons , the breakfast was fine. The hotel has a bit of an issue in that English is not the first language of some of the staff which makes communication difficult and on a couple of occasions almost impossible. On the whole the hotel served our purpose for a not unreasonable price. The hotel has no parking but we parked in a shopping centre nearby for £30 for 24 hrs "
0; Stayed for two nights, 13th and 14th Feb. This was our second visit to this hotel, the first being a few years ago and we were looking forward to our return visit.   The hotel is in a perfect location, very nicely decorated with good sized rooms. We had a double king sea view suite, room 8. I am 6 foot tall and the bed did not look or feel like a king sized bed. On closer inspection it appeared to be two standard singles pushed together, thus I guess standard single length and that may be why my feet were overhanging the end!   But the biggest disappointment was the food which has gone downhill dramatically since our first visit and regrettably there are no other options available within walking distance. The general quality of the food is poor and dinner took almost one hour to arrive. Breakfast was not an improvement, poached egg were served stone cold and again it took well over 45 mins to arrive.  This is a shame, as the front office staff work very hard and its not fair that all their efforts are blown away by the quality and the time it takes for food to arrive. If they can address the quality of the food so it reflects the standard of the rest of he hotel, they will be a winning. But if they don't, I am afraid we will not be returning. 
0; We stayed at this hotel whilst attending a concert at The Royal Albert Hall. It is very convenient and no more than 10mins walk. Nicely situated in Kensingto and lots to do and see in the surrounding area. Street cafe's etc. Hotel is a very typical London hotel. Supreme room was more like a large wardrobe, barely enough room to get around the bed let alone swing a cat. Ensuite was big enough for a small child. Not quite my interpretation of supreme. Breakfast was very average with standard boring fare being offered. Waiting staff seemed to to nothing but argue with each other in various laguages other than english. Probaly would look for alternatives in the future. 
0; Despite phoning in advance of net booking to say we were disabled and unable to walk more than a few yards, we were directed from reception out of the hotel (into the rain) to another entrance double the distance we had stipulated. From there we had to walk the length of two corridors to our allocated room. We both collapsed on the bed when we reached there. This journey had to be repeated every time we went for a meal. We parked in the one disabled bay fairly close to reception which was lucky because we would never have been able to walk up the hill from the main car park. If we had used our mobility scooters there was nowhere to park them in our room. 
0; Firstly - staff are very welcoming and polite! Top marks for staff! Called down to reception to get an iron - got iron within 5 minutes. Iron didnt work. Called down again - brought up another iron within a few mins. Room clean and bed is comfy. Free wifi was good! However the shower was pants. No power to it at all and in the morning it was only luke warm - if the shower was better id of given it 4 stars. 
0; The Novotel London City South is in a great location near London Bridge Tube station and in general I had a fairly pleasant stay but I probably wouldn't return.  The good points were the staff were friendly and efficient, the hotel is in good condition, they have a nice leisure facility and like I say it's well located. My room was ok, fairly spacious with a large bathroom and very good shower. The bed was a bit hard and the covers a bit thin for my liking, the carpet was a bit worn looking and the tv reception was terrible - just didn't get that comfortable a feeling.  As mentioned they also charge for wifi in your room - why in this day and age hotels still do this I don't know as many other hotels i've been too of lesser star rating offer this service without an issue. The mini bar in the room was not plugged in and when it did it didn't work but to be fair they did replace it that day while I was at work - prices as you'd expect - not competitive ! :)  I didn't eat at the restaurant as I was on a room only basis but £15 - £17 per day seems a bit steep to me !   A fairly pleasant stay but i've had better for the same price but i'm sure it would do the job for a leisure stay, not so good for business. 
0; I have now stayed at this hotel for the 3rd years running due to business commitments and it has gradually gone down hill. The over all cleanliness has detiorated both in the surrounding grounds and pathways and so has the interior areas such as the bar, where the service when buissy can become very laboured . The function I had to attend was well done and the food and service quite addiicute.The bedroom was clean and comfortable, but the general feel to the hotel was that of decline. 
0; Stayed one night at this hotel, very central, good transport links to central London, clean and quiet as with all Premier Inn hotels, would recommend this hotel and had lovely evening meal but breakfast not so nice, luke warm coffee in flask (not the usual standard of buffet breakfast as we have experienced in various Premier Inns we have visited over the past few years). Overall acceptable and would recommend but could do better. 
0;Stayed here for 1 night as we needed to be close to the airport for a 4.30 check in.We needed a room to sleep 3 adults and our room came with 2 double beds which made a nice change from a bed settee. It was fairly comfortable and the room average. We were in the older part of the hotel and I think a bit of an update is needed, but for the amount of time we were in the room it was fine. The towels could do to be renewed as well but when you want to be up and out your not looking for luxury. The parking is the bonus with this hotel.It works out at good value and for that alone I would rebook to stay here. That and the extra double bed, it saves on needing 2 rooms.
0; The room was acceptable, the TV was poor not many channels and the reception was awful. The breakfast was late in coming even after twice asking for service. Bad start to the day. Nice setting next to a river and good location for travelling. 
0; I arrived after a slightly pressured trip across London. It was a case of trains, planes and automobiles.  My checking-in process was seriously unimpressive by my initial greeting into the Hotel. The girl at reception barely acknowledged me, before mumbling something at me? I just about worked out, she'd be back at some point. So I stood there...and stood...the lobby was empty, as was the reception area. Eventually she came back and I got my room key after a protracted misunderstanding on the Hotels part about my booking?  The room itself was uninspiring nearly dull to be honest, but functional and clean. The bed and pillows were comfortable.  I had a meal there that evening...again there appears to be a disconnect between good customer service and the customer. The waitress was awkward, I had a struggle to convey my food order over to her in a way that she could easily understand what I was trying to convey over to her? It was a simple burger and chips but it didn't appear to be to her? After quite a wait the meal came out. And it was nice can't really say much more than that.  I had to stay here through no choice of my own. My company was paying for it. I guess if you needed a handy airport hotel for a flight out the next day, it would tick the box. 
0; The interior of the hotel and rooms looks very nice. The staff is also friendly. However it's located right on the A46, it's rather big complex and gets very busy. Many rooms located on ground level and face out towards public areas, walkways and gets busy with people walking past your windows constantly. There are also a lot of kids making it rather noisy and not very relaxing. The hotel overall is just noisy in most areas. The internet was very bad, didn't work most of the time or had no overage. Room service takes a long time. 
0; I will start with a few positives however a number of things took the shine off my visit.  The building itself is very nice, the rooms and reception areas very smart and I liked the feeling of the hotel.  I would also like to mention the receptionists, I have stayed in a lot of hotels and Ive never met such helpful receptionists. It wasnt even one specific person, i spoke to a few of them for help with buses and taxis and restaurents and they were all extremely helpful and professional. I had read that a few people were unimpressed by the breakfast but I went with an open mind. We arrived for breakfast but had no one to greet us, not a problem but we felt unsure if we were just allowed to take a seat or needed to be seated. We found a seat and a lady did come over and ask if we wanted tea or coffee, we both requested tea and it didnt take her long to bring over a pot of coffee. Once we explained we ordered tea she apologised and soon brought the tea, it wasnt a big deal at all but little things like this seem to be a theme for this hotel. The food for breakfast was very nice with enough selection.  We then had an evening out and returned to the bar for a night baileys each before bed. They poored one glass, but then only had enough for half a measure in the second glass and couldnt find another bottle. The young lad apologised and i said no problem just top it up with with some Tia Maria, such a simple solution. Then Mr jobs worth comes over and tells me thats not allowed, they dont sell half measures. They both look at me confused like they have no solution. In the end the only solution (apprently) was I had to pick another drink and they would poor the half of baileys I was really looking forward to and already poored into a glass down the sink. I instead bought a rum and coke which I didnt really want which had flat coke from a bottle. Such incompitance really does boggle the mind, maybe they have rules but they certainly dont have comman sense or any customer service ability behind the bar.  As a treat for the next morning we ordered breakfast to be delievered to the room for between 9.30 and 10am, filled out our card and told reception. At 10.10am we were starting to get concerned especially as we had to vacate the room by 11am. We called the room service line and they had misplaced our food card, they soon found it and said it would be with us in about 10minutes. It arrived around 10.35 so we had to rush it to be out by 11am, not the relaxing breakfast in bed we had hoped for. The gentleman bringing us the food apologised and it was all very nice just very late. The next morning we went to the pool but the jucuzzi was broken, just another dissapointment to add to the list.  In summary the hotel was very nice but to many little things (maninly customer service) just not good enough but could be easily fixed. A lack of attention to details from the staff other than at reception. I wouldnt say this was a great place for a relaxing weekend but it was still above average and if you can get it at the right price then its fine. 
0;Nice looking hotel and nice room,eat in the resturant and would not eat there again,food was crapp,the chicken starter was proccessed and had no taste,my partner had the risotto and that was rather bland, The service was awful as not once were we asked wether we were enjoying out food, The fella on the front desk was helpful,
0; I've stayed here twice in August, both for two nights.  I would say the few things this hotel has going for it is the rate, it's good value for a high class Radisson. The rooms on both occasions were clean with good amenities, included free wifi*, and breakfast.  *The wifi may be free but the speed is horrid, you are routed via proxy in Los Angles which may explain why accessing any UK based site is poor as it's traversing the atlantic four times.  It's a shame that the terrace is being renovated as it has amazing view of the Thames.  My beef with this place is that it is soulless, and believe me I've stayed in some bland hotels around the globe. it's in a bizarre location, not quite near anything useful. It's walkable to Cannery Wharf if you know the way. (on a different note whoever laid our the roads around East India / Blackwall was clearly having a laugh) Views from the rooms are odd, unless you are really lucky to get a river view, you either have a view of an Office, a big glass fish bowl of an apartment block, or the extractor stack for the Blackwall tunnel.  So in summery it's a good hotel, lacking something, in a slightly odd location. 
0;" The George is a beautiful place to stay, however character comes at a price.... You have to expect creaking floorboards and mismatched furniture as &quot;par for the course&quot; in this establishment. The restaurant is excellent quality and food is also served more informally in the bar area. It really is worth trying. There are alternatives in Clochester, but i would rather have the quirkiness of the Geaorge everytime. "
0;" Called for lunch with some Italian visitors on our way to Barrow for a business meeting. The location of the hotel is ideal and the food served was good, but the attitude of the senior person in the restaurant / bar was unpleasant to say the least. He was the only one showing attitude to the customers; the others were helpful. If he cannot suffer the public he is in the wrong job. In the lake district there is an abundance of eating places and customers have a choice. I for one will chose to go elsewhere. I have given a 'poor' rating to service although the other members of staff were good. "
0; Back in my student days, the Royal County reigned supreme as Durham's top hotel. These days, under corporate ownership, it appears to be just one of several comparable choices. It is very central, reasonably up-to-date in its style, deceptively large and meandering. My room was quiet and comfortable. The luxury bed would have fitted a Victorian household. The river view was lovely. The breakfasts were plentiful, varied and efficiently organised. The leisure suite was attractive and well-equipped (but if you're swimming, bring your goggles - the pool is eye-wateringly chlorinated).  Why then only three stars? I'd like to have given the County three and a half but certainly not a fourth. I suspect that the two Marriott bigwigs who stare patronisingly down on the lobby have squeezed this formerly 5-star place until the pips squeak. My bathroom was showing signs of wear, and I suspect that the staffing and systems have been pared to the bone. There was a bizarre miscommunication issue on arrival which cost me an anxious hour and a six-mile bus ride - I'll spare you the details. More importantly, in a booked two-night stay no one bothered to service my room overnight. All the more ironic as my smart key was only set for one night, necessitating a 100 yard roller-coaster trek to the desk to get it reprogrammed. To be fair they did give me a reduction for this oversight, and the staff were never anything less than pleasant. But I didn't leave my usual tip. 
0; We stayed 2 nights B & B to attend a wedding at the hotel. Having stayed at many hotels during the past 12 months I found this hotel very average. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast good but the bar prices well over priced for the quality of both wine and spirit. Minor problems with the room only 1 hand towel (hotel policy) shower door falling off,. bulb missing from reading lamp and for the price paid I would have expected a fridge . Maybe this is related to the bar prices???? Would I book again probably not 
0; There was something about the Park Plaza Leeds that fell flat.  The decor is the public rooms and bedrooms is quite sterile - slightly reminiscent of an Ikea showroom.  The staff were friendly and the location from the station was ideal, but cannot imagine staying for more than one or two nights maximum. 
0; I used Queens for a short stay business trip, positioned right next to the train station with car park for maximum convenience, also reasonably priced for such a prominent location. I recommend this hotel for business trips rather than romantic get aways, the decor is less than impressive. I also advise skipping the 'school breakfast buffet' downstairs.. 
0; Stayed here on business and the basic room has improved quite a bit since last year. However, this is a hotel that commands three figure room rates and I just cannot accept that.  It's location is excellent, the facilities decent enough and even the staff, food and drinks appear to have improved. Even the prices have been revised.  But I can't accept it's room rate. At the end of the day, you'll be sleeping in a room that's just about as average as any other room in Bristol. Only paying at least double the money. 
0;Waiters and waitresses were very friendly and reception.The bar area is very comfortable, and the restaurant is a beautiful conservatory,very good food, but the housekeeping manager she was not nice,rooms not cleaned well.So I recommend only the coming of Lunch
0; apart from the showers being below standard the accommodation was above average. won't stay there again. the showers are more important than a decent bed.the breakfast was good and the location was good. 
0;" but not when your bedroom is right above the reception and you are nothing to do with the wedding !   Hotel is fine, and on the whole the staff are great.... apart from the night manager who shouted at me when I suggested that we shouldn't have been put in room 115, right above the disco when we were nothing to do with the wedding. We all enjoy a good party, but when Black Eyed Peas are rattling you bed with &quot; I gotta feeling ! &quot; at twenty to one in the morning it sort of takes the edge off the nice quiet weekend with the family you expected.  Don't get me wrong , the Bride looked lovely and I'm sure they all had a great wedding at the Clifton, but I wish I was in one of the nice, quiet, empty bedrooms not being used by the dancing party while we were stuffing toilet roll in our ears ! The only thing missing in room 115 is a disco ball !  We did get a £50 discount off our £2000 bill, ( We had another 5 nice and quiet rooms ) but I do have to wonder how as my wife booked in with her 90 year old father on the Thursday, it was ever imagined we were part of a wedding party for Saturday.  Another little annoyance was that we were being encouraged to take breakfast in bed on the Sunday Morning because they were going to be busy in the dining room . Don't understand the sense in that ! Surely that harder for everyone, and hardly what we want when the family get together infrequently.  Let's sum it up. Hotel is nice. Staff are nice. Food is nice.  Personally, I need a nice relaxing weekend away to get over my nice relaxing weekend away !  Phil Barber "
0; Friendly and efficient check-in staff and a straightforward booking and admin procedure. They will sell you car parking...but then you realise the car park is quite some distance from the hotel which is irritating.  The room was clean, well furnished, well equipped but very small. The bathroom...had no bath and a shower so small that it was almost impossible to use unless you are a very slight person.  Shortage of powerpoints in the room and no airconditioning. Nearby loud music venue made it unworkable to have the window open and thus it was a hot sticky night.  The WiFi was cripplingly slow...almost un-usable!  At £108 it was expensive for what it was, there are better value hotels to be had in Bournemouth. Not too bad an experience in all though. 
0;The hotel is tired with the better parts focused on the business user. The rooms are small but adequate if a little tired. The staff are efficient and friendly. The hotel is very clean and tidy. If you stay in a front room your sleep could be disturbed by the road outside if you are a light sleeper. The location of the hotel is good for Oxford Street shopping and within 5minutes walk of a tube station. Regents Park, London Zoo are within walking distance.
0; We chose and executive room to have more space and a sea view. . The room was very cold and the heating system could not cope. A small portable heater found in the corner was inadequate to supplement the heating and was evidence that others had the same problem.  The bathroom was also very cold and the only heat was an eclectic towel rail which could not cope. The room furnishing was tired and looked old. The reception area and bar downstairs was new, bright, lively comfortable and welcoming. The breakfast was average and at the weekend was very busy and felt rushed. We have stayed here several times before but expect to move on next visit. 
0; First off, staff were really friendly, front reception were great. My wife and I had booked a room here for the evening as we were attending a Charity event nearby. Now the amount of time we were in the Hotel was minimal, from 5 in the evening until half six , then back about two in the morning to bed. We've stayed in some really nice hotels and I was really looking forward to the Hilton experience, thing is there wasn't one. At no point whatsoever was I blown away by the place. Room was Ok, bed was too small for two of us and there was no seal on the shower door. I've reviewed some really nice hotels over the years and I was honestly expecting this to be much better, it sort of lacked the finishing touch you would expect from a Hotel chain with this reputation. The reason for only scoring 3 in my overall appraisal was the breakfast. We'd ordered breakfast in the room as we didn't fancy getting down early after getting in late. It was awful, the hash browns were soggy, the coffee was luke warm, and the breakfast had obviously been hot when it was served up because the condensation on the underside of the plate cover was dripping, but by the time we got it was Luke warm at best, no butter with the toast, no salt and pepper and basically nowhere near a standard I would expect from a Hilton. It's a shame, because I live and work in Manchester I wanted it to be a really good stay, I've always wanted to stay, but to be completely honest I'll never go near a Hilton again. In today's World of customer service, the customer needs to be completely satisfied with a product, especially prevalent when paying a premium. Shame, as the people who work there were lovely. 
0; The experience of having a afternoon tea was not I expected I had ordered the veg option for my tea but was brought the meat after a bite found out that it was chicken sandwiches was not happy to be embarrassed to throw up what I had eaten. It's was replaced but my mouth was terrible. 
0;"Well situated for tourists but not my type of hotel. Too big, too impersonal and too &quot;chainy&quot; for my tastes. If you are looking for a place to crash whilst exploring London, then no worries. Personally, I expect something more..."
0; We used a voucher my parents bought us at Christmas to stay at this hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we had a meal there which was ok. Enjoyable but the gnocchi my partner had with his meal was over cooked. Bar that we had above meal. We used the place as a base for Chester and for this it was perfect. The hotel itself is crying out for investment though. Carpets are worn and the decor is very old. With a bit of love and care it could be so much more. It did the trick for us anyway but a 3 star hotel it is. We didn't try the split gym so could not comment on either. 
0; Having previously visited Bartle Hall both for a Wedding and New Years Eve Party which were fantastic occasions I expected they would easily cope with Afternoon Tea. As you arrived the place looks lovely and the reception team were good. Afternoon tea was let down by the very inexperienced staff looking after us at the table. The sandwiches, scones and most cakes were excellent however the cake selection included a well known shop cake, this I couldn't believe. All that said we enjoyed the visit however there are lots of other places that ensure you enjoy a better Afternoon tea, I assume they see afternoon teas as a secondary service. 
0; Too busy. Too noisy. Everything at a price, even wi-fi! We had breakfast pre-booked but the queue was so long to enter the breakfast lounge that we gave up and canceled breakfast. Instead we had a great breakfast across the street at Pret. The evening we dined at the Hilton lounge but the service was a disaster. The waiter kept pushing us to add something else from the menu, just like a cheap salesman. 
0;" I would dearly love to have been able to give a better review. The setting, on Wimbledon Common, is excellent whilst the building, externally, promises a high quality experience.  We had the 2nd floor suite which overlooks the park at the back. The room itself was excellent; the black mold in the shower (which was of high quality) was not; the room was 50 minutes late in being prepared, though we were given a complimentary drink. The bar area is fine with a good selection but the menu (think Café Rouge) is at total odds with the surroundings. Finally we were overcharged by £150 for dinner; an honest mistake but telling. The hotel has changed hands several times over the last few years but seemingly no one is able to make it offer the quality which its situation and location merit. A shame. "
0; Overall the hotel is nice and clean and staff were very good but the room layout is not what we want. Essentially the shower is in the bedroom as is the bathroom sink with a small toilet room facing the bed. If travelling alone it may be less of an issue but I would elect another hotel with more traditional room set up. Overall room a reasonable size.   Also I found their price to be rather extreme. On the night we stayed (Saturday) it was ~£170 (without breakfast) while the next night we found was charging £80. I do not think it was worth that rate and it was booked weeks in advance. 
0; The Premier was easy enough to find, even without a satnav. The receptionist was nice enough and I made my way to a room at the back. There was no traffic noise but there was some sound issues, I'm not sure if it was a combine harvester nearby or a loud ventilator on the adjacent Beefeater restaurant. There is a Texaco petrol station nearby which has a small CO-OP supermarket combined. From here it is an easy run into the Cotswolds or Stratford-u-Avon. I was a bit disappointed to find the maid had not serviced my room in spite of me being out for over nine hours. I found her and told her not to bother, I was only there for two nights anyway. Overall the place is a bit soulless, the rooms are pretty good but the hotel offers nothing else other than a small vending machine and the Beefeater won't be for everyone. It will suit those with a car but is a bit remote for anyone else. 
0;The grandeur of the building and the website had us excited and looking forward tor a great weekend, but unfortunatley it fell a little short. They clearly have a great facility based in a wonderful location in Bath, which in itself is a brilliant place to visit. But the hotel team were not cohesive, it was fragmented and did not run like a slick operation. They had all the makings of a top hotel but fell short on the delivery. There seemed to be a miriad of hiccups thoughout our stay, drinks seemed to take an age to be brought to our table, the orders were wrong, even got asked to pay for them at checkout despite paying for them at the bar, which was awkward! The room was small, very clean and the bed was really comfortable but the view over the air con units.. well what can I say?... Breakfast weighed in at a whoppping £19 each, and we got a buffet layout that you'd find at a budget chain of hotel, and to be fair, said budget chain tasted better, the food was left out so long it was luke warm, no beans making it dry, for £19 per head I would expect it to be freshly cooked and taste sublime. Overall this hotel is pretentious, punching way above it's weight, it has the look, the class, prices and the location to be something bigger, but its playing out of its league with the service it provides.
0; On check-in the middle aged lady with blonde hair seemed to have a superiority complex and gave the impression that I should be 'grateful' that the hotel let me stay there. I had booked a premium room which wasn't ready until after 3.30 which wasn't a good start.  The hotel itself looks like it was last refurbished about 15 years ago and is now looking a little tired and dated. Everywhere you look, you seem to notice the paintwork needs refreshing and paint on the doors is scuffed or chipped. The carpets need an update. It's not bad, but it's noticeable and if they don't deal with this soon the hotel is in danger of becoming a shadow of its former self.  I was a little anxious about dinner (I wanted desperately to enjoy it). However I needn't have been. The service was excellent (I changed my main course no problem), they have an excellent choice of good wines, and the food was of a high standard.  I would say great place to go for dinner, but the standard of the room, corridors and general guest areas need some attention before its too late. Get these things sorted (along with the arrogant check in) and it could be a really good hotel. 
0; Was there for a wedding didn't have enough bar staff working [spent a lot of time waiting] and drinks were expensive. I thought the room pricing should have been more in the region of £80.00 not £127.00 for room only. 
0; We have just had three days in London for a short break, we were given this hotel as a gift so we did not choose it from any list or brochure. I would class this hotel as a coaching hotel they seem to be geared up for the coach touring trade and not the long stayer. The room we had was an executive double, it was clean the bathroom was adequate, the bed comfy even though the pillows were a little thin two small shuttered windows looked over the back of the hotel and surrounding blocks of flats. The biggest problem we had with the hotel was the breakfast arrangements they crammed so many tables into a small area you could not help but bang into other guest getting up and going back to your table from the buffet. And with guests having their overnight cases with them it made for a very uncomfortable meal. 
0;" I've known the University Arms for over 50 years, ever since my parents stayed there in the 1960s, so it is an old friend in a way. Last week was, however, my first visit for some years. The location is good, with fine views if you're lucky with your room, and there is still a hint of Victorian splendour about the central lounge and the rooms around it. But the overall impression was of a hotel that had seen better days.   I was looking forward to eating in the dining room overlooking Parker's Piece, but it's now the &quot;Ballroom&quot; and the restaurant &quot;R17&quot; is in a smaller modern room overlooking the street. However, our dinner there was good and nicely served.  Our room was inconveniently arranged on two levels, with 3 poorly-marked steps separating the sleeping area from the sitting area and bathroom. As a result, you couldn't view the TV from the two armchairs. The bathroom was very narrow at one end, with a very hot towel rail close to the bath. Sound-proofing was poor, with the band at the wedding party in the ballroom clearly audible until they stopped at midnight, but then the creaks from the floor of the bedroom above us were even louder.  A room-service continental breakfast was promptly served, and was OK apart from a shortage of butter.  The staff were all friendly and keen to please, and our complaint about the hazardous steps in the bedroom was sympathetically dealt with by the manager. But my old friend of a hotel now lacks the finesse that I remember. "
0;" Bad points first On arrival I was upgraded foc to an &quot;Executive Room&quot; and was told that the breakfast would be in a smaller room by the main one. the service on day 1 was appalling - took over 20 mins to get just a coffee and after 40 mins still no breakfast so we asked if we could help ourselves to the hot buffet from the main room. It wasn't just us nearly everyone in the executive breakfast room was grumbling. To be fair the duty manageress did admit that this wasn't the usual standard and said she'd fix it for the next day.  The orther bad point was that they room was so warm, it wasn't a particular hot day but the room never cooled down. there was a portable fan but that wasn't much use.  Good Points Day 2 breakfast was buffet and served in the bistro - service and quality were fine. the hotel is in a fantastic location on the Strand, close to theatres, pubs, restaurants. The hotel is bright and very clean.  My average mark is based on the room temp which did stop me from having a good sleep. "
0; stayed at this Hotel as a stop over to visit the Corrie tour ( just down the road). the service and friendliness of the staff was lovely. however the menu was not very extensive even though the food was fab. our room was a split level room with access to the bed up a very steep spiral staircase. lots of areas where you bang your head. people with walking disabilities will have an issue. overall not too bad. the walls seem to be ultra thin as we could listen to the next room conversation as if they were down stairs, right down to hearing them open their bottles of beer ( unfortunately they carried on till 03:00). not too bad 
0; We had a great nights sleep in a big room. However, charging separately for parking in not acceptable. Because of the location, all guest will arrive by car, so be honest and charge the true room rate, which includes parking. The restaurant food in basic but comes hot and well cooked. Pricing is O.K. and service fine. However, the wine is ridiculously overpriced and putting a bottle on the table is so naff. 
0;Despite specifically asking for a 'quiet room', we were kept awake until 3am with no input from staff. There had been a wedding that day but guests were sitting outside in the garden area talking loudly until 3! Then the door banging started at 7 so all in all not a good sleep. The rooms were nice with most things you would need but no air con and despite it being September, the room was too warm. There was also no fan in the bathroom so that became like a sauna! ALso as mentioned by others, the room had poor lighting making it difficult to see properly.  However, the restaurant- Buca di Beppo was lovely with great food and a fab waitress (Kat). She was attentive and funny and helped make it a fun time. The Victory bar afterwards was playing music so a chance to dance. Great
0;The Hotel lies in a very attractive & quiet area, with easy access to a variety of shops & amenities. Parking to the rear of the Hotel was an added bonus. The room was clean & all the usual expectations were in place. If people asked me to recommend a Hotel in Harrogate, this would be the one.
0; I stayed at this hotel twice in January for a total of 5 nights.  Good Points - Friendly Staff - Good Food - Free Wifi - Good location - Good size rooms  Bad Points - hotel is very dated...needs refurbishing - Floor boards creak a lot - 1 morning had no hot water. (this was only 1 morning out of 5) - I don't think the price is justified - Room service menu is expensive - 1 of the rooms i had, the shower guard was not big enough for the bath, so the floor gets completely soaked when taking a shower  Overall - I will be back there this month for 1 night. 
0; We got a great rate, £40, on Late Rooms and booked the hotel for its proximity to Silverstone. Can't really complain for the cost, very comfortable bed, everything you needed in room but nothing special about the hotel (unless you are a MK football fan) and not up to the style standard of other Double Tree hotels we have stayed in (Leeds and Manchester), so on that basis a bit disappointing. We did very much enjoy our cookies on arrival though, nice touch and delicious. 
0; Good points and bad points. Service wasn't as good as previous stays but this was only down to some staff. No water in room for a lot of money. Room not made up on return which was a first in all my travels. Gym great, food good. 
0; The hotel is situated adjacent to a busy road and traffic noise was a problem for me even though I asked for a quiet room. The staff were very friendly, but the ones I spoke to did not seem very knowledgeable regarding the local area.  Breakfasts were ok, as was the restaurant, which we used once.  The first night was spoiled by a barking / howling dog, left in one of the adjacent rooms. The last night was spoiled by rain water over spilling the guttering and splashing down onto our window sill.  The bedroom colour scheme made the room look dark and could have done with a revamp, along with the bathroom, which had what appeared to be mould growing in the bottom right corner of the window. The hand towel had a black L shaped mark on it.  Cobwebs in the roof space of the main dining area, as well as what appears to be a large water mark in the ceiling of the breakfast room.  At our first breakfast, the table was so unsteady, that we had to ask to be moved. At our last breakfast, there was a chip under our table, which must have been from at least the previous day dining. Our bedroom was on the ground floor, but the hallway leading to the reception smelled very fusty / damp and definitely needs attention. Some of the doors make loud banging noises when closing.   Positives: Good location for visiting local attractions such as the Bosworth battlefield. Ample parking. Dining experience ok Value for money  Negatives: Can be noisy due to traffic. No resident lounge area. Very little else within easy walking distance. 
0; First of all, the setting is great, next to a golf course, in an elevated position , and it is genuinely a castle.  Rooms are ok, I understand that the rooms in the main building are better (larger?) than those in the courtyard or mews. The beds are really comfortable. The whole place has character in bucket loads and the staff are helpful and there seem to be plenty of them around.  The downsides (or quirks) are: The lighting is incredibly dim... I had to use the torch on my phone to read my newspaper in the library bar. And it can't be good for health and safety especially as a lot of the floors are so uneven (by the way, the fact that the floor is uneven is not a complaint- just that I'd be happier with a little more light).  The bathrooms are roomy, but when sitting in the bath you can't reach the shampoo or shower gel....why not position them half way down the bath .  There is only a half ironing board that you have to rest on the bed to use.  No electric point near the bedside table, so you can either charge your phone or use it as a clock/alarm but not both!  The curtains in some rooms are not very light tight, which can be a problem at 4:30 am in the summer!  Breakfast - v good buffet and quick service for a cooked to order fry up, but why the insistence on taking a toast order as soon as you sit down??? I want toast either WITH my eggs and bacon (cos the fried bread was pretty poor) or AFTER it to have with marmalade. And I did try to say I'd like my toast a little later please, but that obviously didn't match their script, so I ended up asking for some more fresh toast later. However , my request was dealt with courteously.  On my last trip, my breakfast table was missing a milk jug, butter (there was some margarine ), teaspoon which WAS spotted by the waiter, side plate and marmalade (there was just one pot of jam). So I had to ask for all of those items when I realised each one was missing. But a v pleasant setting in the restaurant.   So, in summary....  What they need to do is spend one night at a Premier Inn to see how rooms should be arranged, make a few alterations, install a few led bulbs , keep the character (and the mattresses) and they'll have a great hotel instead of a good one. 
0; Room ok (apart from the music in the restaurant which could be heard in our bedroom until quite late), but the breakfast service was awful. The waitress, quite frankly, would have needed a local anaesthetic before she smiled. She then turned on some loud and obscure music which we asked to be turned down (we were the only people in the restaurant) , which she did marginally but with much scowling. This then set the tone for the rest of breakfast. We then had to move used plates to another table, she was determined not to do it.  Whoever is in charge of catering is obviously trying to boost profits by paring what is offered down to the bone. I ordered tea which was so weak (one teabag in the teapot) that I had to send it back and order coffee, just enough butter on the table for one person, and only just enough milk on the table for one person. These last two were rectified by 'pinching' more from other tables, the waitress was certainly not going to help.  My wife, who lectures in food safety and hygiene to the catering industry, was most unimpressed by the state of the restaurant floor which had obviously not been cleaned since the previous night's dinner.  I would add that all the other staff that we met whilst there were helpful, cheerful and charming.  All in all, most unsatisfactory. The management are offering a 40% discount on future stays to existing guests. They would do better to sort out their breakfast service if they want people to return. 
0; a good 3.5 star hotel but you pay 5 star prices. Obviously the management know they have a captive market and price the rooms accordingly. We stayed there because we took our two young children to west wittering beach and that was the closest decent hotel. The hotel caters mostly for golfers I'd guess. The staff were excellent and the evening meal that was included in the package was very good. The breakfast was ok but standard English fare. A bit disappointed that they added a charge for service for the evening meal for a few small extras (2 diet cokes) considering that I paid £700 for a 2 night package for 2 rooms (that included afternoon tea on the first night and evening meal on the second night) I found this small additional charge over the top and insulting. Apart from that again as I say if money is not an option I would recommend it. The only other comment I'd make is that I got a small impression that the hotel is not child friendly (although our children had a great time) as very few of the guests had young children...I would guess the hotel mostly caters for adults (golfers etc) Additionally the hotel allows pets (dogs) but charge an extra £25 fee per night for deep cleaning the rooms (overheard a conversation at the reception) ...dogs and young children do not mix in my opinion. 
0; My wife and I have just spent a two night stay at the Churchill Hotel with a group of sixteen friends. The hotel has some very good points and a few bad ones which could be easily remedied with a little effort. It is is a very good location within easy walking distance of the city centre and its many attractions. It is clean and the staff are mostly helpful and friendly. There is a very good car park, which is a bonus for an hotel so near the city centre. However, the general impression is of a gloomy, dark and old fashioned building. The lighting is generally inadequate and lacking in illumination. We stayed in bedroom 132, which was totally lacking any form of lighting in one third of its area and I had to use a torch to see what I was doing on several occasions. The bar was dark and unwelcoming and the area where the breakfast buffet was set out was also dark and cramped. However, improvements were in the process of being done and so the criticism may be premature as this may be a temporary arrangement due to the work being carried out. I found the bed to be hard and uncomfortable, there was only one towel provided in the bathroom for my wife and myself to share between us and this was grey and harsh - so different to the soft, white towels usually provided by hotels. There was no pen or paper provided in the bedroom, although everything else was of a high standard, very clean and totally acceptable. Overall this is a good hotel which, with a little effort and attention to detail, could be excellent. Would we go back there? - difficult to decide at present, but it may be worth another visit when the improvements are complete. 
0; The rooms are nice - however for the price they charge they should be. I found that the common facilities were too small and crowded (lounge, bar area etc). The main disappointment came from the fact that there is a farm near by and some rooms are facing the car park, which adds a noise element that you would hope to avoid in a tranquil location. This means that from 6.30am - 7am onwards you do have cars coming in and you can clearly hear them from the room. We also heard (albeit remotely) some farm machinery. I would have hoped that a hotel in the Cotswolds would have done something to handle this better. 
0; Sofia from the bar/dining area was lovely. Top marks for her.  The bathroom was quite dirty. Breakfast very good and busy!  The hotel was very busy with various events going on.  The Costa Coffee is a disgrace the prices they charge.Drinks and food quite expensive too.  The hotel is very large and has lots of amenities. The Hilton is about 5-10 minute drive from BHX airport. 
0; A very pleasant hotel we stayed bed and breakfast for two nights when down site seeing and a theatre visit. The hotel itself is clean comfortable and good breakfast is on offer to start the day. The hotel is close to Euston Station and not too far from Kings Cross. Perhaps a little too far from the theatre area. I have no complaints with the hotel its what we expected but we will try for something more central next time as we don't want to be jumping on and off the tube as much as we were 
0; Great service, good rooms, great location for Lincoln's Brayford pool area ( Lots of bars and restaurants with outside seating), bar and restaurant have great views of the cathedral (steak was poor though). Biggest problem for me over a 4 night stay was only able to park in the hotel car park (with a £10 per night fee) once. The rest of the time you are given advice on where to park at other car parks, some a good 5 minute walk away, this really spoils the experience. 
0;We booked a 4 night stay at the rate of £124 per night, B+B which I felt was a pretty good deal. The room (actually a small suite) was large and adequate for our family and having a fairly good breakfast included was a plus. The package price compared favourably to many other hotels in the area that we looked at.  Had we paid more, I might have felt more disappointed with some aspects: e.g. certain room requests made at booking and then promised by the front desk were not followed through. Bathroom was very grotty in places and in need of simple cosmetic fixes. The bar and casual restaurant completely lack atmosphere and the food there was not very good for the price charged (try one of the many nearby pubs instead esp. The Talisman). As others have mentioned there is no air-con in the rooms and our room had no fridge either.  One plus point is that have they set up a large family breakfast area with high chairs and kids cutlery at the ready and a small collection of Peppa Pig toys in the corner.  All in all, it's an adequate hotel with nothing in particular that's great about it. Perhaps it is primarily a golfer's hotel (I'm not a golfer and didn't try any of the golf-related facilities at all). Golfing aside, there is a bit of a 'motorway services' feel about the place. Try to get a discounted rate if you can.
0; We booked a non-resident table for an anniversary dinner in the restaurant and this seemed to upset the system.   We had a host of different waiters and our order was taken on an iPad type gismo. We have had a lot of experience of these and none good. This turned out to be the case again.   Although the food was good, tasty and well-cooked it was wrong. The wrong soup for my wife (very quickly changed on complaint so one was ready in the kitchen) and our two different lamb dishes were the wrong mix of meats and accompaniments (we’re resigned by now).   At least they got the wine (although a limited choice of Rose), dessert and the “local” cheese board right (not a wide range of Norfolk cheeses incidentally) but then they tried to charge us for 4 people.   Pretentious is a word that might apply to this restaurant. 
0; Stayed here in February, check in was quick and easy four rooms booked which was fine went to rooms, in our room we had realised we had an room which was for wheel chair users which had a walk in shower which we didn't mind seeing as we just wanted to sleep, when we came to check out apparently we had been upgraded and had to pay £20 supplement fee for this which we wasn't told and was in a wrong room type which they was quick to take off..   Pool and spar facilities were good we really needed a relaxing time.  We went to dinner which we booked in we took a seat, given menus and the usual, we ordered and then due to a delay in the starters the chef offered a light soup compliments of the chef which was good the meal overall was good they were a bit slow to take the plates and replace cutlery but overall was nice.   Breakfast was usual buffet was all good was stocked up with teas and coffees so no issues.    
0; A conference hotel to a fairly high standard. No bathrobe or slippers, but the only room I could get was an executive room, which gave access to an executive lounge, like a business lounge at an airport - extremely well patronised. I got a senior rate, which not all hotels offer. Some big issues though. the beds have mattresses laid in woodem frames, so when you walk round the end more often than not you seriously bruise your shins on the corners of the beds. It is basically a hotel for the NEC close to Birmingham International, but watch out! Late in the evening and early in the morning you cannot walk through the NEC and it is nearly half an hour's walk to the train station via an interminably long route. Having spent an hour walking to and from the station in the evening to get my ticket, I asked the hotel reception and they said there would be a shuttle service for my 05:40 departure in the morning. They were confident they had arranged taxis (in lieu of the normal shuttle bus) but at 05:40 no taxis came. I shared a taxi with an airline pilot and made my train, but it was worrying. The food I had at a conference dinner was very good. You have to walk long distances in the NEC, particularly since one of the main travelators is broken down, and the light hearted apologiy notices are just not good enough. (Can't blame the hotel for that) 
0; Travelling West from Yorkshire had a Sunday Saver stay mid-travels.The hotel is a little dated, I think, living off it's exclusive postcode. Could see a bus load of old dears loving a Turkey &Tinsel break here. Service poor, another hotel twimmed with Poland (which would be fine if they spoke good English). Was charged for two bottles of wine before I challenged my bill. On the whole, what we paid for one night's stay it was OK, presumably the full price for a week's stay would be a fortune. 
0; Stayed over the new year, the room was on the small side but acceptable however the Breakfast was not the hot breakfast was cold and when I spoke to the Manger on departure he's reply was they try to keep the dishes containing the hot breakfast items full, my reply was you have failed. The response was not what I would have expected. 
0;Having stayed at numerous Hotels, i thought it would be wise to book at Marriott just to keep my rewards membership happy... first downside is parking is in a NCP connected to the hotel, but kid you not the foot entrances are confusing...and there is no fixed spots...first come first serve....though as a resident you do get discount parking and unlimited in & out's which is a bonus.   The actual welcome into the hotel is first class and very warm, the check-in was very inviting and as you expected....the lifts and corridors are nice. But the bedroom was cozy, though a bit small....interior bit dated as the air con/heating unit was a late add on... i asked for a high floor number which i always do, no matter where....the view is OK, nothing spectacular...just the other side of Bristol?! i felt the hotel was not at 100% occupancy on a regular basis as dust had started to settle when i went in and the taps had limescale and water marks....but not fussed.  There is a A* leisure facility....Gym, a nice pool (bit shallow with false floor - learnt the hard way!!!) a nice spa bath...very bubbly, sauna and steam room....nice, bright, clean changing room...very good leisure facility!!  After using the facility i realised another downside to my ensuite...the Water Pressure....being on the top floor....their virtually isn't any... i did question this to the front desk but they offered me a change of rooms...but i didn't want to cause much disturbance as i was only staying another night....But worth taking note to maybe improve the infrastructure?  Overall the stay is better compared to your simple business hotels, but there isn't enough to rave about....maybe when i return in a few months it will be a more enjoyable stay.
0; Have stayed here before and I like the old grand building. Roooms comfortable and as I say Classic. Bar area is where I ate and had a drink. Great old Room full of Character. Beer was fine however, I ordered a Holiday Inn Burger expecting the same goodqaulity beef that I have came to expect from Holiday Inn. Very disappointed. It was clearly a Burger Van Burger. The meat was clearly poor quality pork burger or something you would expect from a cheap roadside burger van for a couple of quid. Not !2 quids worth.Tasted awful and strong cheap burger taste and look. I fed this back but no real response to my feedback and I informed waiter I was not paying for. At Checkout I was charged and I then had to go through the rigmaroll of the manager having to remove from bill etc. What did surprise and upset me being a regular HI user was the lack of concern and response by both the waiter and the check out staff. Not one of them apologised. In fact I felt I was the bad guy. Sad to say I will be using the HI express across the road next time. Dissapointing as I like the Hotel. Maybe a new chef.? 
0;" This is an airport hotel within the airport but not accessible from the station or terminals - bizarre design by the authorities. The minibus transfers are OK but not that quick if you are standing in the cold.  Rooms are at the low end of corporate/bland but perfectly comfortable.  Because I was on a budget I ate in the bar and was served the worst beef-burger I've had in at least 40 years: its connection to beef was nugatory. The next morning the &quot;Irish Breakfast&quot; was absolutely terrible - so bad I took a picture of it. To be fair everyone else in the bar and at breakfast seemed perfectly happy but this was really poor quality. "
0;Mucky marks on the walls the sink had a huge crack in it  The room was advertised to have a 2 meter bed but it was not one bed it was two beds pushed together there was even some cocain or other kind of drug down the cracks of the glass top on the dressing table so definitely been cleaned properly (glad I did not have my kids with me ) as we did no notice it till we where packing to leave. Now 3 good points . Wifi in room super fast / great location/ awesome views
0; My wife and I booked a spa break and overnight package here for our 1st wedding anniversary, and although it was nice we expected a lot more. I'll start with the problems The quality of the rooms wasn't great, we could hear people running round and kids screaming down hall ways ect so that wasn't the best. The bed was to soft for us, although that is a personal preference, so if you like a hard bed this isn't for you. the service in the restaurant was actually pretty bad, we waited about 15 minutes to take our drink order and then when it came he just plonked an unopened bottle of wine on the table and walked off. we then waited 25 minutes for our starters to come which I found awful and no apology or explanation. also when we checked out we found the woman on reception a little rude, we had spent £400 at there hotel and she didn't ask how everything was? if we had an issues or anything, I just think that's the type of thing that would come automatic to a receptionist.  The good things  The food, although we waited a long time the food was lovely, especially the pork belly starter. the views are amazing, the setting of this hotel is beautiful. but the best thing was the spa, the staff where amazing I have to say a special thank you to Kirsty who gave me my massage, it was the best I've had, and the rest of the facility's ( the steam rooms and sauna ) are great with lovely views to match. My wife who is 6 months pregnant had the mothers to be spa treatment and loved it.  who I go back here?? To the spa yes in a heart beat, but I wouldn't stay here?.... no I wouldn't, not cause anything was awful, I just didn't love it. 
0;Hotel room tidy and clean but very small. Celebratory meal at lunchtime in Brasserie. Number of places incorrect at start 20 instead of 9! Manager did change very quickly though. The service however was embarrassingly slow. we had to ask several times for drinks and the next course. Don't think we will be dining there again
0;" my stay here was not a good one. The sign in the bathroom should have read &quot;Caution NOT very hot water&quot;, the shower was only slightly more than a dribble, the room had places that had not been cleaned, the towels smelled and even had stains etc. On the plus side, they did have decaff coffee in the room and the bed was quite comfortable. "
0;" Firstly let me say that I stayed here twice once in the hideaway and seconf in the sanctuary. This was before they had all of their new rooms.  First time I stayed in 2009 (stayed in the hideout). Someone had left the shower on upstairs and it leaked right through the ceiling and into our room to which didnt make my experience the best as I woke up to a wet floor and we paid a lot per night.  Second time I went I thought I would go for their best room (stayed in the sanctuary in 2012). This time we had a bigger issue. So I was having a shower and was taking my time as you would. The water was not going down the hole (or was going slowly) and started rolling across the bathroom and went into the living room. As soon as I finished I realised and called reception. The woman had come and told me &quot;yeah, there looks like there is a blockage&quot; and apologized, used some drain cleaner, fixed it and left. Next morning the owner (Stephen), turned up to check the floor board. He said if the water has gone inside the floorboad he would charge me for it though she said it was their fault (remember I'm paying about £350 a night).  Apart from that room and and the district was pretty amazing!  Harry "
0; Staff on reception and the other locations were very pleasant and helpful. Room cleaning service poor and slip shod after the first evening. Restaurant pleasant location and food presentable but slightly pretentious and over priced. Hotel specification stated 20 acres of walkable grounds, their may have been 20 acres but not walkable for any distance. 
0; We stayed for 1 night for a treat for my Birthday. The rooms are very dark even with the lights on. The decor' although quite nice is starting to look grubby. There are stains on the carpets and marks on the walls etc. We couldn't get any cool water out of the tap. At times it was too hot even to wash your hands. We couldn't brush our teeth so we told reception and they brought up a jug of cool water. I thought the breakfast and food overall was very good.. Staff very friendly with a relaxed feel to the hotel. 
0; Myself and friends stayed at the hotel for 1 night check in went ok the room was nice but when we went for breakfast the next morning we found they were understaffed we waited ages to be served we asked for tea but they brought coffee but the breakfast was good pity about the poor staff having to cope everyone was complaining about the service 
0; stayed here to celebrate my wifes 50th birthday (18-20th jan). on arrival we were greeted by a warming sherry little did we know that we could of done with more over the weekend. check in was quick and we were shown to our room which was one of the 15th c suites up at the top of the building. the room was large with seperate lounge area and all the character you would expect of a building of its age so far so good. the shower pressure was little more than a sprinkle . the room was very cold due to a heating problem we didnt mention this because it was only a short stay but did on check out and was assured that if we had they would of supplied extra heaters. the breakfast was hearty and well cooked with both hot and cold available ,served in the royalist resturant complete with suites of armour and the like. we ate at the hotels brassarie chambers on the saturday night and the food and presentation was exellent this part of the hotel is an old court building and again has a lot of character (complete with noose).on checking out my wife was given a birthday card by camilla whitch we thuoght was a nice touch. 
0; If you like golf then this hotel is probably for you - poor À la carte menu, buffet for dinner and breakfast - ok but I could get better at a Toby Carvery. Room was ok but not worth the money - a bit shabby.   Great shame - not up to the normal De Vere standard.  Would not stay again 
0; Nice contemporary room (Watermeadow4) could do with a freshening of paint and filling of significant plaster crack in bathroom. Good level of fixtures and fitting although I struggled to find an ironing bard for the iron!  Complained at reception that the toilet set was defective and just retained on two pins, it was allegedly fixed over a light dinner but came loose again on first use after returning to the room! Effectively dangerously loose! It just rested on two pins!  On calling reception another room was offered but as it was almost 9pm we declined to move.   Nice basics but not there in its delivery. 
0; Normally we enjoy going to the White lion for a drink as its one of the best in hebden bridge. It has a wide range of drinks including japanese beer along with many traditional favourites. It's interior is cosy and warm and has a nice ambience about it. Sadly our last visit did not live up to expectations and right from the outset was on a downhill slide. Firstly as it was christmas we had booked a table for 6, we did this a couple of months in advance and even specified which table. When we got their we was told there had been a mix up and was given a different table in a different room. The table we was given was very small and cramped and not big enough for five, incorrectly laid and cluttered with an abundance of glasses and cutlery. The waiting on service was attentive but the young girls did not appear very well informed as to choice of dishes etc.one was chewing gum all the time which did not look very professional. The menu was very limited and pricey with no festive fair available. A separate christmas menu was on the table falsely advertising some Christmas specials. It had good deals on one, two and three course meals but despite it saying available throughout December, we was told it was unavailable due to the time.again this added to the disappointment.once we had ordered and the food had started to come out the visit started to redeem itself as our starters and mains were very good,they was all well presented and very tasty and deceptively filling despite what appeared to be small portion sizes.all these dishes were served on an array of interesting items including wood blocks and oversized plates which was just not practical considering our table size. Dessert also gained a mixed reception whilst the main part of the desserts was really nice,one was served with lumpy custard and others where served on roofing slates which would have been a nice touch was in not for the fact that the cream would have run off them making a right mess. The slates had to be changed for plates. Lastly, the gents toilets which are normally well kept had fallen below standard with broken fittings, a hand dryer out of order, unclean toilet and so much water on the floor, flippers would have been more appropriate footwear. All in all we felt it was all a bit gourmet night at fawlty towers and it's now off our list of places to go for a meal. It appears they have taking their recent success and good reputation for granted and let standards slip. 
0; This was a convenient location for Christmas visiting and I have used it before. However, two problems this year. Firstly I was asked every day how I was paying for breakfast when this had been pre-booked and paid for which I found annoying and inefficient. Secondly the room was far too hot and even when set to cool the A/C pumped out warm air so the only way to cool down at all was to open windows with resulting traffic noise.  I expect better from Novotel. 
0; Took HdV up on the Sunday offer they do. Room was good, but lackadaisical attitude right through staff.  Stayed in Cune Rioja room. No wifi (as it was advertised). Girl at front desk, while apologising, could not seem to care less.  Obligatory supper in Bistro lacklustre.  We had a nice weekend, but solely due to the cheap deal & making our own fun. 
0;" I booked a spa break for myself and 5 friends as a way to celebrate my 30th birthday. The website & brochure are stunning. Unfortunately the spa didn't live up to all it is portrayed to be...  We arrived around 11am and were greeted by two cheery receptionists. The staff throughout our stay were cheerful and happy. We signed in and went over to the spa where we were once again welcomed well. We were shown to the bistro/cafe in the spa to have a complimentary drink & complete some forms. We were offered hot or cold drinks. The wait between arriving at the spa and being shown around before being able to get changed into our robes was a little too long: it took 30 minutes. We were raring to go but were delayed by the staff in the bistro. We were given a tour of the facilities and then shown where to change.   As soon as we were changed we headed to the pool area. We got some loungers and attempted to relax. Attempted being the operative word because there was an extremely loud swimming instructor giving a group of children lessons. The website gives the following as a description of the spa ; &quot;Sumptuous and tranquil, our spa is the perfect place to relax and ease away the cares of the day.&quot;. Tranquil the pool was not! I totally understand the need for children to learn to swim, but the instructor was the issue, and the lessons went on ALL day. Is there really a need for the instructor to shout 'SHARK' continually when people are trying to relax? As a result of this I spent very little time in the pool area which was a real shame.   The mud room treatment we all received was great - we all enjoyed that! Four of us had an 'intensive facial' and two a 'de-stress massage' - we all enjoyed our treatments and the staff were very nice.   It got to around 2.30pm and we fancied a snack and drink. We hadn't pre-ordered in the bistro because originally we hadn't planned on eating, and were told we didn't have to pre-order as it was fine to just pop in. When we arrived the bistro wasn't that busy, we sat down and one of the staff came over to take our order. Her manner was rushed and abrupt. I asked for a 'fruit platter' which was printed clearly on the menu. I was then asked what I meant despite it being on the menu. I explained I meant a fruit salad. What arrived was quite literally some salad (rocket & peppers) with fruit - not what I ordered. There seemed to be an urgency around payment - the member of staff wanted paying for the food and drinks immediately and stood over us until we did so. I had to ask for the bill to be left on the second occasion so she wasn't stood by us as though we were about to run off without paying. The bill was also incorrect - the member of staff who served us blamed another member of staff for the mistake. That wasn't very professional! I would not be visiting the bistro again.   We went into the 'thermal experience' and tried all of the facilities. Unfortunately the room was a let down. The foot spa had a broken plug and the water couldn't be drained. I really didn't fancy putting my feet into somebody else's water. The heated stone beds were pleasant, but the head rests were tatty, torn and stank of stagnant water. The room was quite small and not as we expected.   Once we had exhausted all the facilities we got changed and went over to our rooms. The rooms were beautiful! Some gorgeous chocolates were left on the dressing table & the rooms were clean and neat. We had nice views over the golf course. Great!   We decided to go down to the bar for a drink and had a couple of cocktails. We were told that it was cocktail hour (technically two-hour) between 5-7 where the cocktails were 'two for one'. In reality the cocktails weren't all 2-4-1 : the £6 cocktails WERE 2-4-1, the £7 cocktails had no offer on them & the £9 cocktails were '2 for £10'. The cocktails we had were nice and were made fairly quickly.   We had dinner reservations for 815 and arrived at the restaurant at 805 to see if we could be seated early. We couldn't which wasn't an issue because we were more than happy to sit in the We were given menus and made our choices. Our waitress was lovely and very attentive. Our table took a little longer than we expected to be ready - it was not until 850 that we sat down. Our starters arrived and were amazing! There was a delay between starter and main course due to a large party being in the restaurant at the same time. As an apology for the inconvenience we were all offered a complimentary drink - this was unexpected and very kind. Great customer service.  One thing puzzled us when we sat at our table - there was a bottle of champagne in a bucket which none of us had ordered, and no member of staff had told us anything about it. We asked one of the waitresses and she told us that somebody had ordered it and asked for it to be delivered to the table. Obviously we wanted to know who, but the restaurant staff didn't know. It took 45minutes of texting people to find out who had ordered the champagne (it turned out to be my mother who had rang the hotel the previous week, ordered the spa and ASKED for it to be delivered to the table with an explanation of where it had come from). It was pretty embarrassing that we had to ask around to see where the champagne had come from. There were two other birthdays in my party so the champagne could have come from anybody. It is fair to say that my mother wasn't best pleased when she found out that it had taken so long for us to figure out where the bottle had come from.   Once we had eaten we sat in the bar for a little while before going to our rooms. On Saturday 15th June there was a wedding in the function room on the 1st floor. Our bedrooms were on the same floor and the noise from the wedding was quite loud in all of our bedrooms.   Breakfast was lovely. There was a good choice of food but the service was slow. It took 30minutes for a pot of tea to arrive and took 20minutes for the bacon to be replenished.   We checked out at 10.40. Nobody on reception asked how our stay had been, if we had any feedback etc. Surely that is just good customer service?  I have no doubt that Formby Hall Golf Resort & Spa can be sumptuous and tranquil, just not on a weekend with weddings and children's swimming lessons. The spa facilities really do need looking into tho.   I probably wouldn't return to this spa which is a shame because there are some great features, but the overall experience was a let down. "
0; Golf:- Three 9 hole courses that are relatively short but challenging. 5 Round over 3 days and didn't get bored so they must be pretty good. Hotel:- Spacious rooms, good and varied food (if a package you have the option to choose your own menu up to a value of £25.) Spa and entertainment:- Used pool , Jacuzzi and steam room which were all great. 10 pin 4 lane bowling alley is modern and great fun as was the simulator golf games room.  Gripes:- Room not booked when got there, reception is pretty poorly run. Problem was not with Golf Breaks as had copies of all paperwork. Rooms and dining area are stiflingly hot, bizarre! Not enough staff in the right place at the right time.  All in all, small things that if changed could make this place really fantastic. 
0;Hotel clean and staff were superb. As a surprise lunch the staff played along with everything. The food could have been better, I would have hated to pay for breakfast. Ran out of food and had to wait while fresh was cooked. Probably the best outcome. Bed left a lot to be desired. Long past it's sell by date, with a huge dip towards the middle. A sleepless night for both of us. Otherwise a good time was had by all
0; Stayed for one night on business. I was in one of the recently renovated rooms which was quite tastefully done and the air con was a bonus.  It was a bit ropey in places though. The pillows were a bit flimsy and cheap feeling and the lift only went to the 3rd floor which meant a fair walk up to the fourth floor with luggage. The floorboards were creaky which was pretty irritating when people were walking around in the early hours and causing noise.   Getting out of the tiny car park is not for the squeamish either.. if you don't have parking sensors, you might need an assistant to get you out.   On a better note, the receptionists were friendly and helpful on arrival/departure and the hotel is in a great location (directly opposite Exeter Central station, 10 minute walk from St David's and very close to the city centre).   As the title says, it's ok, I just expected a bit more from a Mercure. I'm sure it will improve with the ongoing renovations though.    
0; Stayed one night on business. Had stayed there about 10 years ago when the hotlel was relatively new and that had been a good experience. It has gone downhill and does not merit 4 stars. The decorations are unaltered from my first stay. The towels are a little less white and getting a bit tired. The bathrooms are adequate but dated. The reception staff were efficient enough but the restaurant staff, although they try hard, are of poor quality, not well trained and lack leadership. They would be better suited to a local cafe. I ate dinner and breakfast in the hotel. Dinner was of poor quality. The salmon was swimming in what passed for potatoes and vegetables. The cheese board for dessert was stale, rubbery and unimaginitive. Breakfast was only average, although the food was plentiful enough. The location is good it has to be said but the hotel now suffers by comparison with the new Gateshead Hilton which is visible on the other bank of the Tyne. Would not stay there again either for business or pleasure. 
0;Unable to get any hot water from shower in room, only luke warm (may have just been a fault with the shower in our room). Having stopped many times at sister hotel at Lea Marston, I found the room disappointing.
0;I'm used to the Novotel's being quite a good, above average, modern stay. However this one, whilst in a fairly convenient location for us, was a bit average. The photos listed of the rain shower didn't apply to our room - there was a sub par bath/shower only. The exec room was a good size but a little dusty. Bedding and towels were clean but didn't feel 'fresh'. Breakfast was nice - I would perhaps recommend hopping across the road for breakfast instead though as it's cheaper. The staff were friendly and welcoming. I would try somewhere else next time.
0; An extremely convenient location in leafy Pimlico - ten minutes walk from the nearest tube (Pimilco) for access to the rest of London. Good sized, clean apartments - though go for the delux one bed with a lounge. We were mistakenly taken to a one bed and you can't swing a cat in those. Luxury is a very misused word these days but these apartments are perfectly acceptable with helpful staff and all the conveinences you would want. Matching crockery would be nice, or is that being too picky? Oh, the flats were clean but parts were missed - most noticeably the vents, which I find are often missed by many a room service & so spoil the effect. 
0; Positives: location, usual good service from the staff & nice breakfast Negatives: It is a typical big tired old hotel in need of a refurb & some better sound proofing 
0; I've stayed in a few Doubletree by Hilton Hotels and this isn't one of their best. I arrived just after 8.45pm and the computers were down so the last thing I needed was to stand there for 10 minutes whilst someone had to go and physically check the room to make sure it was tidy and empty. Everything was booked in manually and they even had to write down that I wanted breakfast the next morning. The restaurant didn't know about it the next morning though as reception hadn't told them and when I went for my evening meal they were struggling too due to the computers being down. I thought the food choice was pretty average too to be honest.  As for the room, you can't beat a big comfy king sized bed. What you can beat though is two single beds pushed together with an obvious join down the middle as the beds were slightly different heights. Also, as it is close to the flight path for Heathrow, you do get to hear EVERY take off and landing unfortunately as the sound proofing was dreadful.  The receptionist was fantastic, having said all that, and was still there next morning and was still smiling. She also knew the local buses for getting around the area, but she was the exception to the rule. The rest of the staff looked fed up most of the time. Also, when you ask a member of the restaurant staff a question (could I have a coffee please?), you would expect them to understand English and not have to get someone else over so they could take the order.  Would I stay here again? Maybe at that price but only if there was no others available. 
0; A nice hotel with good facilities downstairs (a nice bar and restaurant) but the room didn't really live up to the 4* tag that it is given. It felt small and not as spacious as advertised online, especially for one of the executive double rooms.  The inclusion of Molton Brown toiletries was a nice touch and the bathroom was as expected, clean, functional and the heated mirror is a nice touch for after the hot showers. Great access to the middle of town and into the high street, and the staff were friendly and efficient. 
0; My wife and I paid our first visit here to celebrate our wedding anniversary as it is rated Number1 hotel in Sutton Coldfield.The service was splendid throughout,at all times being attentive and pleasantly personal. The dining room had an appealing ambience,being of medium size and pleasantly warm.I fear that the food was rather disappointing overall.My starter of Crunchy Beef Salad consisted of several tiny pieces of overcooked beef hidden under a nest of interesting salad items.The beef was not enjoyable!My wife's choice of prawns in sauce was acceptable.We both opted for Crispy Pork Belly,accompanied by mashed potato with a sauce,and boiled kale.Thesevegetables failed to indicate the chef's talents! My wife could not finish her Pork as it was much too fatty.I had also requested aside order of roasted vegetables.This became a black mark against the kitchen,as the Vegs were not roasted at all!! Our complaint to the polite head waiter resulted in an apology and an offer of complimentary coffee,which we accepted.My wife enjoyed her Creme Brûlée,but my Lemoncello Tart had little flavour of lemon, and the accompanying ice cream and strawberry were both frozen hard. The coffee was good. Our agreed opinion was that the meal was not in the category of Number 1 in Sutton Coldfield. 
0; It does this trick if you need a cheap place to stay in Newcastle City Centre. The breakfast was nice, but took a good while to come out. It's located within walking distance of Grey Street and the shopping centres. Our stay was pretty quiet. 
0;"We stayed at the hotel for the duration of the Reading festival (2nd year running) due to it's location. In general, the hotel is fine but it is expensive and there are misleading bits of advertising regarding rooms, for example my remittance stated that I was staying in a &quot;superior&quot; room which included a shower and a bath and a pull down bed. When i got to my room it had no bath, no pull down bed and it had a disabled shower. I questioned this with reception only to be told that actually &quot;superior&quot; rooms are their &quot;standard&quot; rooms, but they could find me one with a bath &quot;if I really wanted one&quot; but I may have to wait a while....or I could upgrade to an &quot;executive&quot; room but at a cost !. The hotel was charging a fortune for what looked like a very average cooked breakfast (John Lewis and many other facilites in walking distance was much better value) and £7 for a meal deal that wasn't worth it. The leisure facility is OK but there was a nagging banging noise when in the sauna and steam room - again when reported there was a flimsy excuse that it was being addressed, and I know this was flimsy because I reported it the year before !!. I would stay there again to be fair but I must admit that what they cherge for the festival weekend is pretty steep for what you get"
0; My wife booked this hotel for me just as an overnight getaway for my birthday. We were both very excited as staying at the Hilton sounds very posh, when we got there we were greeted by a gorgeous big clean american style lobby, very impressive and the eating choice was nice (Very expensive, but nice), and the pool looks lovely, wish I had time to try that out. We specified (like it said to on the website) that if a lakeview room was possible, its my birthday so yes please. What we got was a small room, no bigger than a budget chain hotel, quite dark and dated, we looked out the window and got a flat roof covered in cigarette butts. Carpet looked dusty, and the TV was quite old, not even flatscreen. However, sheets and towels were quality, but couldn't get the pillows right, I had two big bouncy pillows, so one was not enough, and two was giving me neck ache. The bottle of water kindly left in our room would have cost me about the price of two pints of beer. So don't use it! I don't know if you get charged for the dressing gown and slippers so we didn't use them. Oh and you have to pay for parking. And room service is charged for on top of the price of food and drink. Overall, I would say take your credit card, and it's ok if you like old hotels with an old feel, but until they get a refurb done I don't think I'll be returning. It is good though if you can get a cheap stay and breakfast package (which was impressive by the way) like we did. It does sound a feel a little harsh writing this review, I would rate it higher if they would just spend a little money on it and just update the rooms slightly, put some flatscreen tv's in which are not expensive these days, and wallop them with paint, new carpets and your laughing. 
0; A 2 night weekend stay in November. I felt that at £119 a night the single room was overpriced. It was nice but small. No breakfast included, though there is a Pret and an Eat opposite which was useful. breakfast at the hotel is way too pricey at £14. The location was fine, though St Paul's tube is not the best situated on the network.  However, the biggest problem is that I have never stayed anywhere with such thin walls. You can hear every drawer being opened in the next room, every conversation, you name it and you can hear it!! It is a problem at all times but particularly people coming back at 2am on a Sat night was bothersome. If you want a good night's sleep - stay elsewhere. Very noisy. 
0; We used this as a free HH reward for 50,000 points - so from that point of view it is fantastic - but the bathroom was very dated and didn't feel up to the usual quality of a Doubletree.   All the staff were fantastic as always and this is in a great location to explore the West End, Covent Garden and the Thames.   We went to Somerset house for the Film4 outdoor cinema and it is an easy 15 min walk. 
0;Bremner Scott restaurant was like a works canteen, poor tables too close together. Average pub food varied in temperature and quality, sound system in Pavilion needs expert attention. Cracked washbasin, mis-matched bedroom furniture, dirt under bedhead and lifting carpet, view from window - room 272 - was 90% roof/brick/lead flashing, noisy plumbing!! Staff good, entertainment good - except comedian was let down by poor sound system, noisy off-duty staff at back of cabaret room whilst acts were on!! Drinks prices are extortionate - £3.80 for a pint, 65p for a dash of lime, 70p for a dash of coke, I am not surprised that a lot of guests were drinking their own in their rooms, or, like us, take half bottle of wine from your meal to the Pavilion. Shall not be going to Warners again.
0;We decided to book a trip to Broadway for the easter bank holiday. We'd been to broadway before and seen The Lygon Arms and fancied a nice break. On arrival we checked in and taken to our room.  The hotel has an Old English feel to it which is very characteristic and charming. The receptionist offered to take our bags and showed us directly to our room which over looked the inner court yard.  The room on first impressions was clean. It was a little bit smaller then expected for the price that we had paid....but this is old england and they have to work with the room they have.  After using the gym which was modern and air conditioned, we went to use the spa. The spa is looking a little bit tired and doesn't match the pictures that we had seen on the website. It could do with a deep clean and an update  We showered in the room. It took a while to loosen up the shower handle and once opened it wouldn't turn off. The manager came to have a look at it and kindly moved us to a bigger room (the shower is still running at this point!).  The new room was at the front of the hotel and was a lot bigger then the previous one. The bathroom was smaller but more modern. The traffic noise wasn't the best and despite having anti-bird spikes we did have a few pigeons almost join us in the morning.  Breakfast was a little steep at £20 a head but the service was very good. We were given a discount on the room over the fact that we had to be moved. The staff were very professional and acted well with what happened.  I probably wouldn't stay here again. The novelty factor is great for American tourists but with the price I think we would have had just as nice a time in a Cotswold B&B. The hotel does need an upgrade. This could be done without destroying the character.
0;Stayed here twice , first occasion was really good , great room and staff helpful, second occasion room was full of defects that house keeping should have picked up before allowing room to be used , also the location of smokers area under room was not only noisy but smoke came up into room,a big downer was the bill was incorrect and over charged many phone calls and 10 days later resolved, for a hotel of this standard I would have expected a service to match room price , premier Inn more on top of guest's needs ,would use again only for location to L.G .
0; We stayed at the Treglos at the beginning of August. I haven’t been to Cornwall since 1977 (was there when Elvis died) and my partner had never been there so we were both really looking forward to our stay at the Treglos. It had been recommended to us by a friend who had stayed there a few years ago and from the website it looked pretty nice. Upon arrival I couldn’t help but think that it reminded me of Faulty Towers! A white painted old building. All it needed was the sign! The hotel is situated on a narrow country lane that leads down the hill to Constantine beach so it is in a fabulous location. Quiet and peaceful and in idyllic surroundings.  The staff were friendly and the eastern European bell boy very attentive and appeared happy in his job. He showed us to our room on the second floor. First impressions were that it was a bit tired although it had a nice addition of an extension which was filled with two large armchairs facing the large window that looked out down the hill to the sea. The walls were covered in dull eighties style wallpaper and the carpet was similar in the way it looked but overall the room was quite nice. The bathroom was clean and the room had an excellent power shower above the bath.  Breakfast was of a very high standard but this is where my bug bear is. It’s all too formal. You feel like you need to speak very quietly so you do not attract attention to yourself. The service is excellent but too OTT for me. The clientele were nearly all over 60 and sitting there rustling their broadsheets and sipping their teas dressed in slack’s/chino’s and shirt’s/polo’s. When I came down in my cargo shorts and tee shirt I felt underdressed and this is for breakfast! The breakfast however was wonderful and you couldn’t fault it. We were told that during evening if you wanted dinner dress code was ‘smart casual’. This meant trousers and a shirt. I didn’t have such clothing and so we decided to eat out. At no time when I booked was this ever mentioned and it annoyed me that some hotels still have such an old fashioned rule jut to come and eat dinner.  Apart from that the facilities are excellent including a lovely indoor swimming pool and Jacuzzi which are a welcome add on to the hotel. Theirs also a spa and massage facilities should this be your thing.   In summery would I stay there again? Probably not simply because of the stuffy old rules just to eat and the tired room décor. For £200 a night I could get better. The hotel is in a beautiful part of the UK and situated in a lovely place and it will suit the more mature client but if you are under 40 give it a swerve! 
0; Great stay in a convenient location. The room was clean and the bar served really nice snacks which was handy for when we got peckish at night.  The only downside was that we were put in a disabled access room on the ground floor, which had no bathtub and a wet room, with the entire design of the room laid out for someone with a disability. This wasn't made apparent to us when we booked, and when we asked if we could change rooms to one with a bathtub, we were told there weren't any bathtub in all the rooms and refused. This is the first time I have ever asked to change room in my life. Overall, we were happy with the cleanliness and the bar, but the helpfulness of the staff and the mix up with the room really put a damper on our stay. 
0; really nice rooms, spa and pool just a shame about the food the only thing to have let it down. thank you to Stuart for going above and bend both nights to make sure our stay was memorable and room service at 3 in the morning ! 
0; Booked to stay at the hotel for a family wedding. I'd elected to put a note in for an upgrade and when I saw that the temperature in London was to be so warm I was keen for an upgrade to a room with climate control. Upon checking-in we found that we had been upgraded, and that we could only get an upgrade if both rooms under the booking were upgraded. I accepted this and we were swiftly checked in. Room upgrade was really good, ended up with the 1 bedroom suite and a junior suite. Our room the 1 bedroom suite was well furnished, lovely floor to ceiling windows. Alas we worked out swiftly that the air conditioning was not cooling the room (the frost icon on the controller wasn't coming on). Went to reception to ask for the balcony doors to be opened and for the climate control / air conditioning to be checked. We went down to the restaurant to look at the menu, the restaurant was very quiet (2 tables occupied) and we were told that we would need to wait 5/10 minutes for them to dress a table for us. Upon looking at the menu we decided not to eat in the hotel, no atmosphere and menu was quite limited. We did come back to the hotel later for a drink with friends/family. Prices were ok for a hotel, but when trying to charge to the room the waiter refused to let me see the receipt despite asking 4 times to have a look. It then turned out that he had added additional drinks to my room account despite the previous round of drinks being signed over to another room by another guest. Problem was solved but the waiter was very secretive and again I had to practically pry the receipt out of his hands to sign. Back up to the room, which was roasting, we had the balcony doors open, but alas the air conditioning wasn't working. I again mentioned to reception who said they would check this out. I said to leave it for the night as we had a draft / breeze coming through with the balcony doors open. We liked the additional touches with the aromatherapy spray, relaxing. Air conditioning never worked throughout our stay and having paid for a more expensive room I would have expected this to be working. Our room had full sun from around 10am to late afternoon and heated up to very uncomfortable temperatures. I had wished that this had been fixed as the next 2 nights sleep quality was diminished due to being uncomfortable. Shame. Check out was fine. Breakfast was great each morning, lots of choice and tasty. All in all, a fair stay, mainly rated down due to the temperature of the room and lack on air conditioning. WE were fortunate that London was 27oC at the time, but wished that our room had the functioning facilities that should have been in place to cool it down. Very disappointing for the cost that it was. 
0; Everything you expect from travelodge just don't take a room on UPPERGROUND FLOOR they are subterranean with no windows or windows with views of carpark ducting !! Described as refurbished but looked very tired Breakfasts great and location brilliant for theatres and shopping       
0;"Visited the Hilton Sunday 15th June for two nights &quot;business trip&quot; on arrival no concierge wanted valet parking no one to park the car &quot;hadn't turned in&quot; was told they only had 15 parking spaces at NCP and they were full later found the real reason ! however found my own car park.  Checked in and went to room on 22nd floor minuets later visited by receptionist they hadn't swiped my credit card so had to return to reception, could they not have phoned the room and asked when we came down for dinner to call at reception I wasn't going anywhere !  Went for dinner, afterwards sat in main bar area for drinks No table service had to go to bar to order barman proceeded to pour G&Ts however picked the cut limes up with his hands and dropped them in the glasses &quot; no tongs&quot;. went to bed later thought I would use the mini bar o no ! automatically locked I then found out I should have paid a £50 deposit for the mini bar .  decided to have a cup of tea instead, on the second morning I went to make early morning tea to find that although tea and coffee had been replenished paper tops had been put on cups but cold tea from the previous day was still in the cups went to breakfast witnessed waiter drop cutlery on the floor and just put it back on the table.  Hygiene needs addressed and your staff need better training you are cutting corners all in all on this occasion you were not up to it !  Harper K Room 2012"
0;" This place is in need of a refurbishment as it has seen better days. The staff cannot be faulted, but are unfairly disadvantaged by the surroundings. The bed in our 'Deluxe Double' was awful, with an oversize wooden surround that loved shins, and a cheap mattress that was a bit like a waterbed... Furnishings are threadbare and bathroom past its best too. TV better than average. To whoever owns this hotel;- Please invest, as the staff deserve better... "
0; This was our first stay at Sopwell House whilst visiting friends nearby. On arrival, we entered the well furnished reception area and found the reception staff friendly and professional. They found us a room straight away despite us arriving early. Our room on the first floor was a good size, clean and well furnished. But no bottled water - something we have come to expect in a hotel these days. Makes all the difference.  We tried the spa at about 7.30 pm and were warned it closed at 9pm. The pool, steam room and sauna were all good, although we found the spa pool not hot enough for us. At about 8.30 pm, the staff came in and started collecting up all the towels and dressing gowns from around the pool without checking who they belonged to - we had to ask them to put ours back! Couldn't they wait a extra 30 minutes until it closed?   All was going well until we tried the bar. It seems they normally have two, but a sign indicated the cocktail bar was closed for refurbishment. So we headed to the Terrace bar. Lack of staff and slow service made the whole experience quite stressful. My wife wanted a Tia Maria with her coffee but they didn't have any. I ordered a portion of fries with our drinks but had almost given up hope when they arrived 50 minutes later at about 11 pm! My wife also queued for about 10 minutes for a glass of tap water. We were not impressed.  The following morning, the hotel went up in our estimations as the breakfast was excellent and service was also good. Just a shame the experience in the bar spoilt the overall experience. I don't think we'd visit again. 
0; Was very disappointed that after going through the check in process to get to our designated room to find it aleady occupied, luckily we didn't disturb the occupants but it was obvious from thier belongings in view that the room was still in use. After speaking to reception they were most contrite and arranged an alternative room very quickly but it became quickly apparent that the room hadn't been properly prepared and what was supposed to be a king sized double bed was actually two singles pushed together with seperate covers etc effectivley meaning that the room was a twin rather than the deluxe double we had expected. My wife tried to articulate this to the receptionist in the morning but she did not seem to comprehend the problem. 
0; My wife and I stayed here for two nights to take advantage of the Chatsworth House package (bed and breakfast for two nights with dinner included on the first night and two tickets to visit Chatsworth House and Gardens) which the hotel offers. The hotel is modern, situated in a business park but with easy access by car to the MI and Sheffield city centre. There is ample free parking.The hotel was very clean and the bedrooms were nicely decorated ,furnished and well equipped. The double bed was very comfortable and the staff were very friendly and provided excellent service. The help yourself breakfast is what you would expect in a modern hotel. The only reason why we did not give a higher rating is because we were very disappointed with the quality of the evening meal on the first night of our stay. As a result we ate elsewhere on our second night. Nevertheless we consider that overall our stay was good value for money. 
0; I was looking forward to trying the Mal as I've had drinks in the bar a few times and thought the place looked lovely. The room was ok, we had booked a standard room and that's what it was. I can't put my finger on it, but there was something lacking. It was clean and well furnished, but a little cold and lifeless. The public areas are much more inviting and cosy, so maybe that's why I was disappointed.  On the plus side, the breakfast was delicious, the usual cereals and fruit to help yourself, and then a cooked to order, full breakfast with ample toast and tea. Probably won't stay here again as I think Leeds has better offerings for the same price. 
0;" Called with my wife on a Sunday for Afternoon Tea. The plus points were very nice and airy room; excellent sandwiches and tasty cakes. Minus points were it took 35 minutes to bring the food after we were given the drinks- far too long.Also the scones were so over baked that they were inedible. Attention to the minus points would have merited a better overall rating. "
0; Stayed over a Saturday/Sunday night in August 2012. When checking in we tried to negotiate using a code 'summer12' from their website which was not available when we made the reservation but we noticed was available just before we checked it - was told this was not possible. Found this aggravating as we felt penalised for booking early when the offer was not running. Tried again when checking out and no go... morally unfair not to offer the best rate....  Other than that the hotel was fine. Rooms were too hot (common to many hotels) so on the second night we left all the windows open. Noise wasn't too bad but this is a wedding hotel so don't be surprised if you hear some hi-jinx! Food was good (not amazing) and a fair price. Found the spa pool slightly uninspiring - rather small and busy. Kids can only swim for a couple of hours in the morning and evening.  Broadband everywhere (and free) was very welcome. Rooms were large and tv and other facilities were good. The main bar has started refurbishment which seems a little odd to do in August but I guess they are a conference hotel so busier outside the holiday season, hence their offer (which we couldn't get access too, grrr!). 
0; Fantastic grounds and interesting country house - let down by antique furniture in bedrooms failing to provide for modern living - by all means have the public area decked out in brown furniture but update the bedrooms to cater for today's needs and not Victorian requirements. Staff are superb and the Stable Restaurant is without fault(try the pork burger with black pudding - best burger in England!) 
0; Had our wedding here, which was Fantastic, and spent the night in the Frances Anne suite. We then stayed for my Wifes birthday in the circular shaped suite which was our favourite. However there is a few things that let the hotel down, such as holes in windows, plumbing problems, and i'd say it was a bit over priced for the rooms.  My brother stayed in the Vane Tempest at our wedding, and had plumbing problems in that room. Over a year later, and our third stay, we stayed in that room, and found it to be very cold. Then in the morning, when I came to take a shower, within about 2 minutes there was no hot water and it was ice cold. My wife then couldn't have a shower and we both had to get showered when we got home instead, which the morning after a wedding, a shower is what is needed to freshen up. When breakfast arrived, there was a few things missing. The beans were missing, so made the breakfast rather dry The staff also said our 2 hot drinks would arrive separately, and be brought straight up, but they never arrived. When I mentioned that we had no hot water to shower to the receptionist, we were just told unfortunately it's a old building so the plumbing system is old. Now at a cost of £220.00 for 1 night stay, I'd say that it was unacceptable, to not be able to shower, and if that room has plumbing issues, then this should be noted upon booking, and reflected in the price. This left me feeling a little bit disappointed and that I had wasted the money staying for a night.  However, Wynyard Hall is still a very nice place to visit, and if staying over, I would avoid the Vane Tempest room, and go with one of the other suites available. We since went to the afternoon tea at the movies event, which was nice. I would return to Wynyard Hall, but not in that room. If it wasn't for my last overnight stay then I would have gave it a 4*, knocking just 1* off for a few maintenance tasks, such as broken windows in corridors and rooms that have been there that I know of, for over a year. Drinks prices id say are quite reasonable, with the exception of Baileys. I tried a few cocktails and they were very nice, with a wide range of drinks available.  Really hope Wynyard sort out the plumbing issues with the Vane Tempest and invite me back, as it really does feel like that room was a waste of money on that occasion. 
0; I had a single room. It was very small. I knew it from my first visits at the Rathbone, but well, I had forgotten how small. In many ways the Rathbone is a nice little hotels, but there are allways small irritating troubles about the stay. This time there were two bigger ones. First: The bar, which is cosy, was much to cold, because of an open door, which I and other quests closed several times. Second: The bath - it was very difficult to get hot water, and when you succeeded it disappeared nearly immediatly. 
0;" The Water Meadow rooms were good - a really nice view and a perfect spot to bring our labrador for the weekend. The room itself was also very pleasant: neutral decor, nice shower, bath, comfortable bed and Bose sound system. However, they do not serve cocktails which was a little shocking. We were also told that &quot;cocktails are a London thing&quot; and there was no demand for cocktails in Tuddenham... this was confusing given the clientelle the hotel was clearly trying to attract (Mr and Mrs Smith membership and all!). Also, the hotel doesn't take Amex which is just annoying (no doubt another thing that is solely for people from London). Altogether, I think there are better places to stay that will make you feel more welcome. "
0; Came here with my daughter, son in law, and grandson for the first time , they came the previous year and loved it . room was ok on arrival in the room was a tea towel,washing up liquid,pan scourer, dish cloth , the room had a fridge,cooker,kettle microwave,(some coffee,tea,sugar,milk to make a couple of drinks. the staff from red coats to gardeners where very polite and friendly ,all though they have upgraded the site when you do walk round most of the site is still a bit old army billet style , we dined (half board )in the deck and yacht club restaurant ,could not fault the food , you could choose which ever restaurant and take your food from one to another as one done Carvery , and the other done English type , Chinese ,Mexican, salads, etc, so you would keep everyone happy and all be able to sit together ,plenty to do for the young ones ,the shows where very good , it is a must for tos , shall return again a big thumbs up from me never experienced a Butlins before and was surprised 
0; My Wife and I decided to try this Hotel for Sunday Lunch. I do not like to find fault with any establishment but as this is a fairly high rated hotel I thought that in this instance I would take the trouble to pass on some observations. Firstly the food was perfectly acceptable for an Hotel catering for this number of customers, however the service was very inconsistant. We noticed that one waitress was absolutely on the ball,introducing herself to the tables she was looking after and generally being most helpfull and professional. Other customers (ourselves included) just received the minimum of service from other waiting staff serving our tables which we would not have expected from a four star hotel. In my opinion (for what its worth ) is that the staff could be better trained and supervised. Having said that, the dining room was comfortable and had nice views across St Austell Bay. Would we go there again? Perhaps but it would not be high on our list as there are some really good places to eat in our area- Nare Hotel, Tresanton, to name two. 
0; We stayed here as a weekend just to get away so my wife could use the spa and I could play golf.   Firstly I'd like to say that there are so many things that this hotel has going for it:  - Lovely rooms - Friendly and helpful staff - Excellent food - Nice golf course  However, it is the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in! We were put into the Leamington room on the Friday night and at 10:30pm the disco started at the function in the room below. The noise was ridiculous and could be heard all down the corridors. We called reception who sent the duty manager to our room who agreed that this was not acceptable and moved us to the Study room for the night. This room was lovely with a balcony, but it was right at the top of the stairs above reception so you could hear people coming and going all night, and then were woken 8am prompt by the breakfast crowd. I have two questions about the hotels logic on this:  1. Why put a couple in the room above a function when their are other rooms available? 2. Why put a premium room next to one of the busiest parts of the hotel?  The following day I played golf (which was great) and my wife used the spa. Again, a complete breakdown of logic on the part of the hotel owners as the 'relaxation' rooms are right next to the bar! All my wife could hear during her 'relaxing' massage was a bunch of rowdy golfers watching the rugby.  We were back in the Leamington on Saturday night where we had been left a bottle of fizz and some chocolates for our trouble which was very nice of the hotel, and there was no function so we were able to sleep. But we were woken by very loud golfers at 7:30am on the first tee, then at 10am our room was physically shaking with someone obviously moving furniture around. So much for a relaxing Sunday morning.  We both felt that it was a real shame as noise spoilt our stay and everything else had been brilliant. The only way I could stay at this hotel again would be if I could be very specific about the part of the hotel my room was in. 
0; Spent a Saturday night here with two other couples, playing golf or using the spa. Our room was fabulous and superb value. The hotel is well appointed and the setting is beautiful.The staff were very friendly and keen to help but were simply overwhelmed. The hotel was full and there just didn't seem to be enough staff - we had to chase our order for coffee on Saturday morning, cream tea took a while and breakfast was shambolic - there were up to 12 people queuing outside the room waiting to be seated all the time we were in there. Food ran out and couldn't be replaced fast enough. Golf was good value but somewhat damp underfoot 
0; We stayed at Taplow House Hotel as a base for the Royal Ascot. Hotel nice enough although a bit dated. Room was very small but adequate. We were a fairly large group of 10 and the kitchen staff seemed to struggle to accommodate dinner on the two nights we stayed with the main course coming out after about an hour and a half. Food was very nice however. Few pointers - bar area perhaps needs a bit more work and when guests arrive with lots of bags, always a good idea to offer to help take them up to the room for you which the four members of staff behind the reception desk failed to notice. 
0; I stayed in this hotel during my weekend trip to Salysbury. The hotel is not far from Stonehenge and is in a good distance to Salisbury’s attractions, such as Old Sarum Castle and Salisbury Cathedral.  However the hotel is in a road far away from the town. If you are using public transport, I think you will regret to stay there.  I have absolutely no complaints regarding the room. It is clean, comfortable, good size, modern and silent. The sleeping quality is very good! Also good is the reception. It takes only a minute to do the check in / check out. The hotel provides good parking for your car.     I don’t recommend the restaurant for dinner. The food was good, but the service is terrible. When I arrived asking for a table, the waiter asked me to go to the bar and have a drink while he would prepare a table for me, but I could see plenty of tables and waiters available. After 5 minutes the same waiter realized I was definitely not interested on waiting (for nothing) at the bar and invited me to go to the restaurant. In there, the waiters took a very, very long time to take the order. I was about to give up when someone came to me. Everytime I tried to order something, I had to struggle to have their attention. They are kind of forgetful as well because I had to ask 3 times for water. In the end, I think the problem is with the management of the service. The food is very good, but I can’t say the same of the service. Very close to the hotel you can find Pizza Hut, Costa Café, KFC and more. I will eat there or in Salisbury if I stay in this hotel again. 
0;Stayed at the hotel on the 1st of May whilst traveling. The rooms are small but comfortable and quite clean although a few stains on the carpets could be removed to make the stay more pleasant. The bathroom is small but well fitted out with the normal shower over tub style bath toilet and basin all packed in nicely to the small space. The bed was quite comfortable with nice support. Where the hotel is let down is with things like towels and toilet paper. Towels are like sandpaper, feel like they haver seen any fabric softener. The toilet paper is the cheapest money can buy and not very nice to use. Then there's the room key, whilst it's good that it's a proper key and not a card system you need an extra bag to cart the thing around in as they include a keyring that could double as an iron gate. The breakfast served was quite good although I always pass comment to my partner when I feel I make better at home and this was one of those occasions. At £7.50 it is fairly good value though. Staff are quite friendly and courteous and All in all it is a pleasant place to stay. A few things that could easily be improved on let it down a little.
0;" We've stayed at this hotel during the Jorvik Festival for two nights. The hotel is located about 6 miles out of York, on its own grounds. It's a nice property, decoration is a bit date and in need of a refresh; the hotel comprised of a newer wing and a older manor house wing. The hotel itself is nice, the lobby, library and bar areas are quite big, which meant that we could sit in a corner sofa and not have anyone around, which was lovely. They had a good selection of wines in the bar.   I think the improvement could be done in two areas: service and breakfast. The service was just okay. We weren't greeted with a smile or an enthusiastic hello. Even though I mentioned to the receptionist that it was my first stay at any Accor hotels and that I was a Gold Le Club Accor member (through airmiles), there was no recognition or any prompting on explaining more about the hotel, the facilities, etc. Overall, the service could improve, be more friendly and welcoming, as hotel should offer this level of service.   The breakfast was of a poor quality, not very good sausages, and the quality overall wasn't up to standards of a 4 stars hotel. On the second day, I had breakfast at the Holiday Inn York with a friend, and the quality was far better, even though we paid the same price. "
0; We booked a Club room that should be upgraded to a normal. Unfortunately our bed was of poor quality with you both rolling into the middle and one sleeping on a slope. Some of the decor was of poor finishing and whilst we asked for a quiet room we were put on the second floor and could hear some road noise. The breakfast was of good quality and the hotel has a good location, shame about some of the finishing touches. 
0;" Great location for central Bristol, lovely rooms and hotel however they charge £13 pound for parking! when the room is £130 a night. Also there car pack was full when we came to check in which was a nightmare.  The hotel names says ''Hotel &Spa&quot; There is not a spa here only a swimming pool, I booked this hotel because I was under the impression there was spa facilities.  The staff were ok and the food was average but over priced. "
0; As an out of the way hotel TM is a match for any country or city hotel. While there is no grand country house to attract, the grounds and environment can make up for that on a sunny summer day.  The quiet Mill Stream Room was equipped with a quality bed and bathroom plus those nice extra touches found in the best hotels I’ve stayed in. As you are paying not me, I'll simply calculate my basic B&B price for comparison at £100 for two.   The restaurant serves a menu with dishes more interesting than many. The sweets were great I thought. The service could not be faulted – it was gently friendly, not say, the stuffy that grates. The meat I had was excellent and tasty. (The fish dish featured raw river trout and the menu might have warned this was so).  The wine was overpriced. Regularly adding a £3 bill surprise for extra butter with two slices of baguette, could successfully burst bubbles. While the portions however are needlessly tiny and this no place to find good value, the quality of the experience had enough excellence to not disappoint. 
0; Easy enough to find ,sat nav took us almost there and quick phone call completed the journey. Ian was there to open door and was friendly enough but didn't meet his wife / partner at all. Ground floor room was clean and tidy with a rather nice small en suite.  View from window was obstructed by wrought iron on the outside which was obviously for security but made me feel a little uneasy as although it prevents people getting in, it also stops us getting out. I wonder how I would get out if there were a fire in the hall?  Also although it was quiet enough the night we stayed but we were woken on Monday morning by traffic on the road outside. That said we slept well enough and the bed was comfortable. On arrival at the breakfast room no one was about but Owner was there within a few seconds and said he saw us on the CCTV camera in the hall which made me feel uncomfortable. The food was excellent very hot and generous portions. Location was good as it was only a short walk to town centre and restaurants  We were rushed out the door a little early so that the tiler could get on with tiling the porch. Still did not even see the other half of the team but I'm sure she saw us cutesy of CCTV. Overall good enough for overnight business stay but personally I would not return. 
0; We stayed for 2 nights at the Hotel in September. I've waited a while to write this review because I am concerned that I might sound paranoid. Having a room with a sea view on the 4th floor made us initially feel really positive about our stay. However, at breakfast we asked to sit at a particular vacant table in the restaurant. As the waitress was setting the table up for us, another member of staff who seemed to have a position of some authority started shouting at us that we could not sit at that particular table. The matter was however quickly resolved by the waitress, who seemed to quickly reassure the other member of staff that it was ok for us to sit there. At dinner that evening we were a table of at least 12 people, As part of my order for wine, I asked for a bottle of white wine, which was appropriately placed in an ice bucket beside where I was sitting. As the hotel was busy that night, there was no-one refilling peoples' wine glasses- a task I was happy to undertake. At some point, one of the staff came to the table and said that he would take over the refilling of glasses. I told him that I was happy doing it. A bit later one of the waiters moved the ice bucket that had been beside me, and I didn't realize had placed it directly behind my chair. The next time I got up, I knocked the ice bucket over. It was a bit embarrassing as the iced water went over the feet of a diner at an adjoining table. However, it could have been a lot worse. The next morning, when I went to pay the bill, I found that wine ordered by another of our party had been put on my bill. I was able to resolve the situation without taking the matter up with the hotel staff. All of the above could have been accidental, but I'm not completely convinced. 
0;" I struggled to find it even with my satnav. The turning into the garage has to be approached from the south and it's still rather hairy getting in and then negotiating the tight turns inside if you drive anything larger than a Fiat 500... We got an upgrade and the room was pleasant but small. Check out the Doubletree (2 mins walk away and on the attractive canal-side) instead; I will next time. "
0;Stayed here second time on business. Impressive on arrival and good public areas - but rooms a little tired - I think I must have had an un-refurbished one. Food OK but restaurant tends to be very quiet. Many eat in the bar area. Good rates.
0;" Took my partner for a special treat, handed a plastic bag with robe towel and slippers on our arrival, had approx three minute explanation of the rosul (which was fine by the way), that was the last time we saw a member of staff, we were book d for a twelve thirty lunch, we asked for dry robes and were met with a huff!!, after lunch we were booked for a massage, we didn't know where to go as we'd never been shown round, the massage was approx twenty five mins in total, all in all poor to non existent customer service (staff in the brassiere pleasant though), no induction or attention to make the experience special for couples, great outdoor hot tubs saving feature, shame really for the £170 we spent, not worth it, no inclination to head back again in a hurry&quot; "
0; Oh dear. This is not going to earn me a free room upgrade from management, as it is not going to be a 5 star review.   Let's start with the positives though. The pool and the spa are very good, although my wife found the pool and jacuzzi temperatures a bit on the cold side (even though it said 30°C on the matrix display). The treatments are good - we experienced the thalassotherapy pool (again not overly warm in the room), massage and facial - and the treatment reception happily rearranged the allotted times of our treatments to suit us better.   The restaurant food was very good and the staff pleasant and helpful, as we have always experienced them to be. We had a nice view over the lake from a 'superior' room.  On to the negatives then, of which there are several. Let's start with the 'superior' room, for which we paid extra. I understand from reading other responses that some rooms will be refitted next month, and they are definitely in need of modernisation: wooden patio doors with foam insulation that was non-existent in places, allowing an icy draught to come in, extractor fan in the bathroom on constantly and sounding like a jet engine, no thermostat in the room (meaning you have to experiment with the equally noisy radiator), no mixer taps in the (very average) bathroom and fittings coming away from the wall.  The biggest problem I personally had with our room was the bed. We had requested a double bed at booking time, but this was just two singles tied together. There was also no sheet and blanket alternative to the thick duvet offered. To be fair I did not ask housekeeping whether one was available, as I seem to be the only person in the world who prefers the controllable warmth of sheets and blankets to sweltering under a thick duvet.   Also, when we asked for another 'comfy' chair for the room - only ONE chair for a double room??? - housekeeping turned up with a desk chair instead. When we explained that we needed a second comfy chair, they went away to find one. Unfortunately they never returned, so our faith in getting other problems addressed took a bit of a bashing.  Modernisation will definitely help this hotel, but you also need to address Arrivals and Departures Reception staff concerns. After we had queued at the tiny arrivals desk, when it was our turn to be served, we stood waiting for a cheery greeting from the man behind the desk. It never came. In fact, I had to initiate conversation, as the silence was becoming embarrassing. This is not the way to greet guests. We struggled to understand our check-in person, as he appeared to be trying to break the speed-talking record.   Departures is usually more professional in our experience, although this time we were not asked whether we had enjoyed our stay. It felt like a financial transaction.  So overall, we left relaxed, tired (due to lack of sleep) and disappointed. Disappointed, because when I pay over £550 per night I expect a bit of luxury. This was just average. 
0;I stayed at this hotel last evening with my wife and daughter. We stayed on the 10th floor in a room at the front of the building. We were all woken on several different occasions during the night due to road noise and sirens - so didn't have the best of nights sleep.  When we came down for breakfast at 9.15am we had to queue for about 15-20 minutes. When we got to the front of the queue we were told the next table that would seat 4 would be 6-7 minutes so invited to sit and wait. Whilst we were waiting several couples were shown to tables and then another family of 4 who were behind us in the queue were shown to a table ahead of us.  I did inform reception know about lack of sleep and the receptionist sort of said that I had asked for a room with a view and therefore you will get noise. I wasn't made aware of this upon checking in! She also said that next time I should ask for a room around the back although the views aren't as good.  That is a very big assumption that I will be returning!!!
0; The service in the hotel was friendly, polite and efficient.  Our room was on the top floor. The room was adequate, clean and quiet.  The location of the hotel is perfect. We used the London underground a great deal and selected the Hilton for its proximity to St Pancras, the Eurostar terminal. The restaurant was a disappointment. There was no atmosphere and the food choice for diner was really poor although breakfast was fine. Our newspaper was not delivered in the morning as promised and there were problems with the TV in the room. There were few channels, which was surprising.  The location is key while the restaurant needs to be reviewed urgently. It is overpriced especially for short stays. 
0; Four star hotel with four star reception rooms, five star location and good parking and then it goes down hill from there. As I approached our lake view room, I noticed that the bottom of the door had been roughly trimmed and in need of painting. The Bathroom door was the same. The room itself was adequate but not in my opinion four star. No fridge or safe. Wall paper torn in three places all be it very small areas. The Bathroom would struggle to meet three star status. Dinner : Soup average but bread nice. Sirloin steak with five pound supplement was very bland in taste and had a texture more suited to liver. My Wife left hers although I ate mine as it was edible but not enjoyable. The peppercorn sauce was like cream coloured milk. The chunky chips were neatly stacked in log cabin style. I managed to chew through one chip and decided not to risk my teeth with any more, so left the other five as they had a very tough exterior and dried out in the middle. The strudel was nice but spoiled by the miserly dot of hard cream which accompanied it. Breakfast : They got that half right. Sausage, bacon and egg were hot, beans and black pudding were cold and the hash brown was simply awful. As there was a Coach Trip in the breakfast room who all turned up at 8.00 on the dot, it was difficult to access the corn flakes and fruit etc made worse by the small table spoons which were provided to decant the corn flakes into your bowl. Ther should have been an alternative table to separate the guests. All in all, not good value which is a shame as it does have some nice features which are let down mainly by the catering. 
0; We had a 1 night stay at Shrigley Hall Hotel to celebrate Xmas with 7 other work colleagues and their partners. We had a few scares on the final part of our journey to get there. The Satnav took us down a long, winding narrow country lane on our approach to Pott Shrigley. We breathed a sigh of relief when we arrived in one piece on this dark, foggy early Friday evening.  After following the signs to the car park, above and to the right of the hotel, we headed for the nearest illuminated entrance with our luggage. We struggled to find any signage to the Reception, but fortunately walked in on half a dozen staff laying out tables in one of the function rooms. One member of staff kindly carried my wife’s case as he led the way on a complex route down to Reception. After checking in, the Receptionist handed me the room key cards and then directed my attention to an aerial photograph of the hotel which was on the wall. She pointed to the car park area and started referring to a ramp leading to an entrance at the rear of the hotel. Somewhat puzzled, I said “Yes, that’s where we parked the car”. I was stunned when I suddenly realised she was explaining that we needed to walk all the way around the outside of the hotel to get to our room. The indoor route was clearly too difficult to explain. “It’s really quite easy to find if you walk around to the car park” explained the Receptionist as she pointed to the main door to exit the hotel. After a 10 minute uphill hike dragging our cases on this cold, dark and wet night, my wife and I eventually arrived at our room. Then, after negotiating a lift, multiple left and right turns and some quite steep steps, we arrived at the Courtyard bar for a quick drink. A compass and a pair of climbing boots would have helped as we re-traced our steps back to the room. However, the complexity of the indoor route was far more preferable to walking via the car park in the cold, wet rain. The hotel seriously needs to look at a better way of directing guests to their rooms on arrival. Kicking them out into the cold and wet is poor customer service to put it mildly.  After changing, we joined our colleagues in the bar before moving onto the function room where various different organisations were enjoying the Xmas festivities. No real complaints about the food other than to say the portions could have been a bit more generous. As the night progressed, we moved back to the Courtyard bar. Having paid cash at the bars all night, I was a bit surprised when I was told my final round of drinks would need to be charged to the room. I provided my details and signed the chitty before returning to join my friends. Shortly afterwards, the barman interrupted our discussion and asked if I could go to Reception to discuss the room charge. I obliged and was told I would need to provide a debit or credit card. After advising that I had left my credit card in the room, the Receptionist asked that I go and get it. Not wishing to embark on a mini climbing expedition, I politely declined this request and again offered to pay cash. A 5 minute stand-off then took place before the Receptionist eventually relented and accepted my cash. I have to say that I was appalled that the hotel’s procedures allowed this situation to take place. If cash payments are not accepted at a certain point in the evening, this should have been explained and my credit card details scanned at the point of check-in. The incident that took place was embarrassing to me and my work colleagues and the hotel is marked down due to this aspect of their service.  The room itself was very comfortable and we had a good night’s sleep. The quality of the cooked breakfast was good, but my wife was disappointed that there were no fried eggs available or milk to add to her cup of tea at the time she was making her selection.  Overall, we had a reasonably enjoyable stay but it was marred by the initial welcome when we were asked to go to our room via the car park and, secondly when cash suddenly became a non-acceptable method of payment. 
0; Stayed one night. The room and bed were clean and comfortable with walk in shower. Reception was friendly and helpful. Our room fronted onto the street which suffered from city 'night noises'. Parking is 200m away in shopping centre carpark. Rooms in this old hotel are in a rabbit warren. If you have a mobility problem be sure to ask for room close to reception - ours was 85 paces away. Housekeeping had not refilled our 'in room' tea/coffee but reception provided. We did not eat in the hotel. If you want to be in central Chester for a short stay and you can get a 'deal' the hotel is acceptable. 
0; - Friendly, efficient, helpful staff - Well located for Heathrow Airport (take the TfL bus from Heathrow Central and walk the last 10 minutes, it's free) - Excellent restaurant, fantastic food at a reasonable price - Comfortable room, clean and well-appointed  - Looking a bit tired in places - bathrooms need work, room fixtures need updating, carpets in hallways need fixing (currently stuck down with duct tape, probably due to years of suitcases passing over them) - WiFi unjustifiably expensive (away from the reception area) - Modern bar but with television big screen booming out (could be switched off once the football is done - background music would be better than invasive TV adverts)  In summary, not bad and comfortable for the night, but let down by a few niggles that need attention. 
0;Paying £180 for one night we expected much more. Breakfast not included in the price. Check in 3pm and room which was meant to have two queen beds didn't. Just two doubles. Arrived to dirty glasses and bucket outside room (349) and had to move ourselves. 3 star at best and wouldn't stay again. Location is only positive.
0;" We selected the Doubletree Hotel for its great location by the river and close to the sights in Cambridge. We were not disappointed with this aspect. The rooms were reasonable, clean and modern, if a little small. We only had breakfast in the hotel, during our one night stay. This was included in the room price and reasonably presented, but the buffet area was set out in a cramped location, which does not help the guests make a relaxed selection. The things we were not happy with included, overpriced drinks at the bar, being charged for parking, being given information by reception staff, which at best was misleading and just felt like we were fobbed off just to have an easy time and not bothered about giving the guests false information and advice. Not impressed by the poor quality of this service, which involved the hotel arranging a taxi to take four of us the Newmarket Races, then being stranded with no means of getting back and the night manager gave the clear impression of &quot; could not careless and it's not my problem&quot;. Never trust anything the Reception or Management tell you, make independent arrangements to make sure you are not stranded too. "
0;I had read the reviews of the Seafood and Grill with interest prior to my booking at the Seafood and Grill and I have to say I was very disappointed. Although the restaurant is lovely and the views gorgeous and the service second to none its such a shame the food was such a let down. Not in terms of quality but in quantity. When people are paying over £80 per head I would expect to feel satisfied after dinner but alas no. Its fortunate that the owner of the restaurant is called Outlaw as that is just how I felt, robbed. Having experienced similar restaurants in the area (including the well known ones in Padstow) I cannot see how in today's world of value for money people can get away with charging the outrageous prices that the Seafood and Grill currently do. Take my advice by all means enjoy the view and have a drink on the terrace and then take the ferry across the river and have the same meal for half the price but with twice the post meal satisfaction.
0; The Majestic Hotel is ideally located within a short walk into Harrogate Town Centre. The room was comfortable and the staff were very warm and friendly. The meals were ok, but I would not say the meals were 4 Star quality. The facilities were good with a Gym and swimming pool and Spa facility. My main dislike was that guests were charged £5 per night for parking! I have never stayed in a hotel were the guess are charged to park their cars at the hotel. When asked why, the reason was that as the hotel is close to the town centre, people were parking in the hotel carpark and then going into town! I am sure they could think of a better of controlling parking rather than charging guests £5 a night. 
0; Went for afternoon tea with friends on a glorious May Sunday afternoon. Undoubtedly, you pay for the location, which is very impressive.  The tea itself though was just not worth £30! It wasn't bad but far from the delicious feast I would have expected for that price! It's £17 for literally just tea and scones - bit crazy! Service not great either. Tea was brought (after a very long wait) but not all the cups and by the time they arrived the tea was overbrewed and tepid. Also no refills of tea were offered - it's hot water people! So by the time food arrived - no more tea!  I am not posh and very much easily pleased but I found the experience disappointing for the money. Oh and they added £4.50 service charge (15% per head) which was an absolute cheek given that we were basically ignored! 
0; A large Hotel and conference centre set in open countryside. We had an executive room which was large and comfortable. The bars and reception were well appointed. The lady who serviced our room was very helpful and did a very good job of cleaning the room. I advised her the standard lamp was not working which she reported for us and it was repaired by our return. The only thing which spoiled our stay was the quality of the food in the restaurant. We had an evening meal the main course we ordered was chicken breast. This was so dry you could not eat it. In the first instance our meal was delivered to another table so it took 45 minutes from finishing the starter to serving the main course. More like a £3.50 wedding breakfast than a £20 restaurant meal. The following morning was even more of a disaster as while eating my breakfast my partner noticed a cooked fly nestling in a mushroom on my plate. I called the restaurant manager who explained this away by saying this happens at this time of year as the windows are open. He failed to explain how the fly got cooked after flying through the window and rushed off with the plate to dispose of the evidence. It appears to me that the kitchens at this establishment are not up to a very good hygeine standard and the method of cooking and presenting leaves a lot to be desired. 
0; I would say best in the area for a business stay  Very good staff food good and consistent . rooms OK generally quiet and beds comfortable Grounds very picturesque in spring and summer  Close to main road Will stay again next week  
0;" We stayed as a couple for one night to attend a concert at the LG Arena. In summary;  PRO's Location to Halls (5 minute walk) Secure parking and location Modern clean and spacious rooms.  CON's Bar Service extremely poor. Long wait for drinks and a snack meal at 4:30pm! After the concert at 11pm an even longer wait for drinks whilst waiting at the bar Large crack in sink! Overall cost for one nights B & B for two people, incl a couple of drinks and a snack meal each-£230! I think that's expensive! "
0; We arrived here at 1 am in the morning, expecting to be greeted by a lone night-porter. What actually greeted us was a hotel lobby full of noisy drunk people and kids running around. We could barely hear the receptionist over the noise - but he neither acknowledged the noise or apologised for it. A hotel lobby bar should be the model of quiet sophistication - not a drunken free-for-all.  The room itself was nice enough, but the separate WC had all the décor and ambience of a public toilet cubicle. It was also very warm, with no air-con, fan, or a window that opened more than a couple of inches. Despite this, the bed was very comfortable.  The lift in the morning proved a particular challenge. The button to call the lift to go 'DOWN' was broken, so there was a helpful note telling guests to press the 'UP' button. Unfortunately, this meant that you entered the lift going up, stopping for guests on the way, and then down stopping for more guests until finally reaching reception. If there's a problem with the lift, fix it! Don't just put up a sign...!  My final word is about the price - we paid out nearly £500 for three people for a two-night stay. This did not include breakfast, and parking was charged as an extra. This is an outrageous price for any hotel - let alone one that is in need of basic maintenance and refurbishment. 
0; Was in chamber unique room which was nice but quite warm. Had to turn off the aircon at night as it was too noisy. I was looking forward to a nice hot bath after playing golf but the fancy shower and bath system only produced lukewarm water. The sink had boiling hot water but no good for a soak. The tea making things were hidden away in the wardrobe. At breakfast there were no bowls for cereal and eventually after several people had asked a few arrived. The hot food wasn't hot and there were no fried or scrambled eggs, beans or mushrooms. It was the same the next morning as well. The dining room wasn't busy and it wasn't late so there was no excuse really. Dinner at night was at best ok and it was nearly the same choices both nights Most of the staff were very nice and the pool area was good but it is very expensive for drinks and food. Sadly I won't be back here again 
0;Arrived Friday night for relaxing weekend,had booked a suite for a treat,room was nice until we found out toilet leaked onto the floor when flushed so we were given another suite with no trouble,another very nice room so all was well,down to the bar we went to a very pleasant barman as were all the staff ,had a great night.breakfast the first morning was very good but Sunday morning it was like the chef couldn't get the hot food to the help yourself trays fast enough,a lot of people waiting for eggs to have with the rest of their cooked breakfast,I gave up waiting.we had dinner at the hotel on Saturday night,won't do that again my wife couldn't eat hers ended up not being charged for it and full of apology from the waitress but the chef wouldn't make an appearance,so would stay again very helpful staff just wouldn't have dinner.
0; Visited fairlawns as part of a wedding party, on too many occasions did the staff either not know what they were doing or didn,t listen when asked for help ? Room was ok apart from some uninviting stains on the carpet oh and the lack of a shower door ment that we had to staunch the tide with towels to stop it going into the bedroom. On checking in we were told where to have breakfast but on the following morning were told we were in the wrong place and should be seated in another room with the wedding party ? At breakfast the table was a place setting short, which was delt with apart from a glass to have fruit juice. They were told that a member of our party was gluten intolerent but their breakfast still came with toast on it even though the order was no toast. Breakfast had mediocre ingredients and poorly executed cooking, snotty egg, and the poached just tasted of vinegar. On check out they said there was a charge for use of the leisure facilities, we had been no where near it ? Staff training needs reviewing. 
0; stayed here for the weekend,room very comfortable. we had one problem which was dealt with very promptly,the hotel sent a very nice bottle of wine for our inconvienence. many thanks, the staff are very pleasent if a little stretched at busy times. 
0;" We have previously stayed at Nidd Hall and Thoresby in this group of hotels - and enjoyed them both - we would give them 5 stars. My partner had also stayed at Holme Lacy some years ago, and was very much looking forward to staying there again - he had told me how good the house was inside, with large rooms to relax in and just read a book. Sadly, we were very disappointed. Let me start with the good things - the grounds, gardens and exterior are excellent - the best gardens in any so far - congratulations! The staff were also generally very pleasant and helpful (with one notable exception) and would always smile and greet you if you walked past. Having someone to greet you as you drive up to the building is good too - although the chronic shortage of disabled spaces is a problem (it needs some spaces behind the Pavilion for those staying at that end of the building). After that though, it was mainly downhill. Reception was chaotic. There were only 4 other couples trying to check-in when we arrived. There was no obvious queuing system, people were just standing around wondering where to go. There were 2 or 3 desks arranged at an angle - I guess like an American 'Meet and Greet' but no obvious sign as to if they were open. Staff were wandering around and took no notice of you. There was a room beyond reception with yet more desks - but was this also check-in - or just administrative offices? We stood behind another couple standing near one of the desks - no one behind the desk though. After some time a receptionist came back and completed what was obviously a check-in part-way through. When finished with them, she never looked at us, but took our papers with the booking reference. After some time, she got up and disappeared to another desk (no explanation as to why - but watching the other desk, the same seemed to happen there). She returned and gave us our room key and wished us 'have a good stay' in what I can only describe as the same degree of enthusiasm and sincerity you would expect from an American supermarket check-out girl. We had to ask about dining and were just directed to go 'round the corner'. Reception badly needs someone to greet you and direct you and some general management. It felt more like a business conference check-in. We were assigned a dining table in the Courtyard, and fortunately were in the area under the skylight, so at least it was well lit by daylight. The dining area in the room you enter through was positively gloomy though. However, the rows of tables were far too close together - we were in the middle of a row, and struggled to get past other diners to get to/from the seats. We don't mind being close to the next table - we enjoy meeting and talking to people, but you do need room to get in and out. There were large mirrors on the rear wall of the Courtyard, presumably to make it look bigger. Unfortunately, the net effect was to double the perceived number of diners and make it look (my partner's comment) more like a cafe. On the first evening, the room was unpleasantly hot; I noticed they had fans in place for the other evenings. Following other comments on here, we had a look at the Bremner restaurant. The main room looked fine, but the seating in 'the corridor' looked like an afterthought. I would have hated being seated here - it was dark and gloomy and just felt like the corridor it once was (see below). The Orchard room (fine dining) which we looked in was again rather oppressive and gloomy. Goodness knows what it would be like in winter. Our dining neighbours did comment that they had found it very difficult to see the food in that restaurant. I should comment that our waiter in the Courtyard was excellent (Mateusz?). Friendly and attentive and quick service. As to the meals; my feeling is that they are not as good as they have been elsewhere (but maybe they have gone downhill too). The evening meals now seems to push you towards the carvery - there is little choice beyond this. Starters were rather bland. The overall impression I came away with was that instead of the evening meal being to be enjoyed, it was something to be got over with as quickly as possible. Although my partner quite enjoyed breakfast, I ended up having just orange juice after the first day. The cereal table had very limited choice - and the muesli was sickeningly sweet. The bowls of fruit looked to be straight out of a tin. Breakfast was OK I guess if you like a fry-up, but not if you want a reasonably healthy breakfast. The Terrace Bar service was slow - and the room itself had all the charm and character of a station buffet vintage 1970. Such a shame, because the ceiling was one of the wonderful plasterwork ceilings of the major rooms. Our Standard bedroom was OK - large and comfortable bed, spotlessly clean and well serviced each day while we were having breakfast. But please provide some more lighting! The only way you could see what was in the wardrobe at night was to open the bathroom door and use the bathroom light. Even more importantly, there is totally inadequate lighting to allow you to read in an evening, unless you were in bed and held the book under the bedside light.  I have left our most serious criticism to last however. Since my partner last visited, the whole atmosphere of the historic house has been spoilt by making what was once the impressive corridor off reception a part of the Bremner restaurant. This now means that the main thoroughfare from the front of the house and reception to the bedrooms and other areas is through the old State Rooms - such as the lovely Blue Room. This has destroyed the feel and character of these rooms. The seating is now limited to either side the corridor which has been created through them. Furthermore, they are no longer places to relax in - they are just busy thoroughfares. In fact, there are now no suitable areas inside the house to just sit, relax and read - apart from your bedroom. I do wonder as well, how long the lovely floor in the Blue Room will survive all the foot-fall. For all the atmosphere that is now left, we both felt we might as well have stayed in a Holiday Inn. We did ask our neigbours in the restaurant - some of whom have been regular visitors to Holme Lacy and other properties in the group - and they shared our views.  Overall then, very sad and disappointing. We will possibly return to Nidd, but not to Holme lacy. We will also now be very cautious about recommending Warner to anyone else. "
0; I stay here periodically - sometimes one night, sometimes more. It's well positioned & facilities are OK. As with many hotels, entering & exiting can be a smokey affair with smoking types gathering around the door. God knows how frustrating it must be for staff having to regularly collect butt ends & clear the spit from the contract labour. At least, they're not smoking indoors. 
0; This hotel is in quite a good location, just outside of the city centre but close enough to be accessible. There are a variety of restaurants close by as well. Rooms are clean and tidy. Smaller rooms on the inside are more modern whereas the larger rooms on the outside are a bit dated. The heating also has issues on the top floor so you have to make do with a fan heater (located in the wardrobe). The public areas are well presented too and the breakfast is fresh and very good value. Service when we went was a little surly and our group ended up getting charged twice for a couple of the rooms. Receptionist was reluctant to call a manager and couldn't even manage an apology. If you are planning on drinking into the early hours here - think again - there's no 24 hour bar. For a place to crash on a trip to Birmingham, this is overall good value. 
0; The stay is pleasant with the big room. However the rooms is aged and I find the lighting is a bit too dim. This made the room a bit creepy at night in my opinion. The room is reasonably clean. The furniture is dated and show signs of wear and tear. The hotel has a nice view of river tyne and the surrounding setting is nice. The hotel restaurant is nice and the service is good. However, I think the lobby really need a renovation and I think it's not up to a 4 star standard. 
0;" This is a very comfortable hotel in a fine setting. The staff were very welcoming, helpful, and friendly (especially a young man from Venezuela). On the negative side, we did not find it particularly customer-friendly to have to make a diversion from the normal route from the bar/restaurant area to our room at night and from our room to the restaurant in the morning. The staff involved were pretty forthright; offered no apology; and offered no explanation. Rumour later had it that the Inter Milan football team were there. So what? Also, there was something wrong with the sausages at breakfast time. On day one I took two, took a bite out of each and decided they were not pleasant. On day two, I took just one but, again, not pleasant. They were either off or of a very unpleasant taste. "
0; Staff were pleasant enough. The room was clean but the furniture was strangely battered and mismatched. Bed was lumpy and the pillows had seen better days. I would say a refurbishment is in order. Carpet was stained but the room was very clean. Bathroom large and spotless.  Major downside for me was the terrible internet service provided. Varied between non existent and just above old dial up rates. This for me made my evening considerably less productive than it could have been and rules this hotel out for any future stays.  In this day and age I would say that for any hotel a usable internet service is essential perhaps while they are upgrading they could also look at replacing some of the furniture/beds. 
0;" The fire alarm light was situated directly above our bed and flashed so brightly we could &quot;see&quot; it even with our eyes shut! We had to sleep with our bedside lamp on to counteract the effect. The Manager was totally unsympathetic to our poor night's sleep. Will definitely NOT be returning! "
0; I stayed one night on business   The rate was good for mid week, the room was large, clean, but as others have said was a bit dated and could do with a revamp  My main issue was I arrived at around 3pm, there was about 6 people waiting to check in, but only one person on the desk. There was a lot of staff milling around. I politely stopped a gentleman, who appeared to be a manager and asked if more staff could be put on the check out. I was told no, although in a polite tone. He did suggest I had a coffee while I waited, I m not sure if this would be complimentary as I declined the offer as I had business I needed to do 
0; We attended a private party on the first floor having order food well in advance of the event. Service was very poor and fragmented, with a 35 minute wait between collecting one course and appearing with the next one....same with the time between the main course and the dessert. Food was very tasty but was cold, we did complain about it but it didn't make any difference, we were left to eat it or leave it. A number of other guests also complained about the cold food....same response. Not a place we would come to again I am sad to say. The room was nice and the ambience was good, but it was let down by poor service and slow delivery of food which they new about in advance. When asked what had happened to the various desserts, we were told they were busy making them.....as for the portion of custard ? well little more than an egg-cupful. 
0; Initial response on arrival was very brusque as we knew we were early but just wanted to check in, no pretence of checking if room ready. The restaurant and Bar staff were all very friendly, communacative and efficient. Shower control needs a plumber as mentioned to reception but it appeared problem was not a one off. the hotel sits at a lovely location on the river and is only a short stroll into the city and would certainly visit again if going to Salisbury. 
0; We stayed in this hotel and found the welcome warm and friendly.  The location is up a steep hill but not too far. Difficult though if you have mobility problems if you don't have a car.  The rooms are very corporate but very clean and with great hospitality tray.  The beds were soft, some pillows very soft some firm but full and fluffy.  It was very warm and the staff offered fans for the rooms.  The breakfast was typically laid out cereals fruit juices etc all well presented in a nice dinning room.  Sadly the hot breakfast was awful. We had scrambled egg on toast well that's what we ordered.  What we got was hot bread not toasted with a small spoonful of scrambled egg. Very disappointing.  If your looking for somewhere close to the centre of town this hotel is in a good location. It has a nice terrace and small swimming pool.  It was overall good. 
0; The hotel is modern and clean but the staff were perhaps not as respectful as in most Holiday Inns. When I arrived I had to ask if they were aware that i was Priority club member - they gave the impression that they were not and asked for my membership card - I have since confirmed with my booking agent that they sent the hotle all my details. At all of the other Holiday inns that I use on a regular basis there is generally always something for platinum members such as a voucher for a free drink, discounted food, a room upgrade, bottled water in your room, chocolates in your room but here not even recogntion. 
0; Marriott hotels never fail to disappoint me so it was with trepidation that I saw this hotel was the venue of a three day conference I have just returned from. For some reason every time I've ended up in a Marriott from Liverpool to Bangkok there has been something 'happen'. So lets get that out of the way first...  The building is dated and needs maintenance. My shower did not work in that once it was on, it would not turn off. I had to return to the reception desk twice on the same day to have my card key re-programmed which, baring in mind I was only there for two nights was not great. Finally, the lifts are so slow a lot of us used the stairs which were basically the fire escape. I'd suggest if guests are going to use them then some effort in to making that area at least in keeping with the rest of the hotel rather than bare pipes and cracking paint would be a good start. Marriott is apparently a sought after brand but as I say, I always seem to have 'something' happen.  Happily though, in contrast with the others I've stayed in, the staff were wonderful. The reception staff and porters were really friendly, polite and helpful. I'm not sure if they provided the conference staff but they were equally happy, helpful and professional throughout. I had a note from 'Dawn' who was cleaning my room which was a personal touch and we exchanged a couple of messages of thanks which made it more than a generic greeting card. Special note should go to Charlotte on the bar who was very friendly, engaging and polite as well as her team members Jason and Jordan who also helped my stay be enjoyable, though just for the benefit of your friendly bickering - Charlotte is better than you Jordan!  The breakfast at the hotel was nice - scrambled egg aside which should be avoided at all costs due to a complete lack of consistency but there were plenty of other options. The room itself was comfortable enough and the location was great for a walk in to town in the evenings. There's a gym and a pool which were both good value and well equipped.  The only reason really I've gone for a three rating is the building maintenance which, in a supposed luxury hotel, isn't something I expect to ever be an issue. Would I stay here again? Possibly... 
0; This place appeared quite nice upon arrival but in general was an average experience that we wouldn't repeat. The staff were friendly enough, although some in the dining room were a little fussy and inefficient.  Our room was okay but was pretty characterless and showing signs of wear - also with silly oversights such as a lack of toilet brush. There was a problem with control of the emergency escape exit that caused the corridors to be cold and smokey because the hotel allowed smokers to use them as a general access/egress route causing them to be frequently wide open allowing the cold air and smoke to be blown in. To my mind such practise should be discouraged and smokers should exit via the main entrance, they're entitled to smoke but shouldn't inconvenience other guests in the process. The food in the restaurant and at breakfast was good.  Overall, this is an okay venue that possibly suits its partial use as a conference venue but is not really a charming experience. 
0; We stayed at the hotel on a dinner bed and breakfast deal from one of the many sites which offers these type of deals. As we had not paid the full price for our stay I will keep my review neutral. Our main meal was of a very good standard and the dining room staff were attentive and friendly with just the right gap between courses. The property itself is set in very stunning surroundings. The only real downside was our room which we found depressing -the colour scheme was not to our liking and I guess there are better rooms available and our room choice was perhaps down to the package we were on. Overall I was expecting a lot more and came away with no strong feelings either way. If you are seeking a very quiet time away from the everyday hustle and bustle then I would recommend a stay at the hotel. I think for us it was just a bit too quiet. 
0; We were really disappointed for the size of the room and the bed. It should be considered a single room under European standards, let alone US standards. We hired the hotel based on the information provided at the hotel site. Even the bathroom had only one shower towel, which indicates that the room was prepared for one person but was sold for two people.  Other than the room, the different employees were very nice, but they were not able to help us when we complained about the size of the room. 
0; We stayed in this hotel and booked a superior and paid more but were told by hotel that standard and superior rooms were the same. Smallest room we have ever stayed in, bathroom very small too. No doubt the deluxe rooms are bigger. Hotel very busy therefore could not upgrade so to compensate had a free bottle of champagne. Vouchers also given because only one lift working. However, the hotel had nice atmosphere and bar/restaurant looked over canal. 
0; over night stay here in preparation for a wedding the following day.  When we booked this the hotel was listed as a Ramada, and when we arrived we discovered it had changed hands to Penta Hotels.   Penta is a 'different' brand. Trying to break from the usual style. The reception is the bar, the whole area is lit in a funky disco style, glitter balls on the ceiling, interesting art work on the walls and furniture. If your expecting the usual hotel style reception, this will throw you!!!!!!  Once you 'get' the style, it's very refreshing, and relaxing. Breakfast is great, good selection of hot and cold, various juices coffees teas and cava!   The negative for this stay is that the rooms are still in the previous brands style, and having stayed at Penta in Reading and Prague that's a shame. The staff are still finding their feet a bit, but I'm sure this will improve.   Parking is an issue, they have a very small car park, but the overflow is a short drive away, and a short walk back across a bridge. As long as it's not throwing it down or blowing a hoolie it's no hardship what so ever. 
0;" We just returned from our one night stay at the hotel which we selected through the LEGOLAND website.   It was 10 miles away from the park and under normal road conditions it took over 20 minutes. Not bad but we came from London and it only took 40 minutes from our house so seemed a little silly to be staying there at all... Can't blame the hotel for that though.   The check in process was good and staff were very friendly. The entrance of the hotel isn't particularly nice but the reception area is clean and tidy. There is no outside area; however as the hotel is basically on the corner of some major roads it is unsurprising.   After checking in we went to our room which was a little out of the way on the third floor. I believe it was towards the back of the hotel but couldn't exactly see from the window as we were looking out onto a corrugated iron roof top in two directions with an obscure building preventing any sort of view.   The room itself was quite nice, there were 4 of us, 2 adults and 2 kids (4 and 2) and with two double beds and a cot there wasn't much room though. We asked to see some alternative rooms however they were all much of a muchness. The bathroom and bedroom were clean however we checked in at 3pm as directed and the hallways leading up to our room were very untidy. Every other room had something outside it, whether it was linen, laundry or leftover room service. Strangely our room had a tray of plates and glasses outside it which was a little disappointing. We had to phone down twice but eventually the hallway was cleared.   The pool is fine and although old and very tired it does the job, same with the changing rooms. I think that for the price, any of these additional facilities are a real bonus.  We decided not to eat dinner in the hotel, as although this was a kid friendly hotel the actual restaurant didn't open until 7. The breakfast however was very nice and we were well looked after in the morning.   The staff were very nice and did their best to accommodate us.This hotel was meant to be an extension of our LEGOLAND trip and in that respect it failed to deliver. On the whole though a reasonable hotel for the money... you don't pay much but on balance get marginally more than you pay for all in all. "
0; We just stayed here for two nights because of its location. We paid an extra £25 per night to have a Connoisseur Room, ie larger, with a super-king bed, balcony, breakfast (normally an expensive £11.95 each), wifi (normally a ripoff £12 per 24 hours) and superior toiletries. The bed, bathroom and breakfast were all excellent. The staff were friendly and helpful. But the outside of the hotel needs repainting, the room furniture is of good quality but old and shabby, a lot of the carpets are old and the lifts are slow. The trouserpress was broken, but left switched on and with its PAT testing five years past its date. Other electrical items in the room were well past their retesting date. Last night was a very cold one but the hotel heating was switched off. A promised portable heater only came this morning when it was too late. The duty manager told me the hotel is to be refurbished later this year. It needs to be, and it needs its swimming pool putting back. Oh, even the name of the hotel at the roadside is out of date and confusing... 
0; The former De Vere hotel is no longer in the premier league as it once was, it used to be a very high standard hotel and it is a shame to see how it has declined. The staff are fine, but the noise from I assume guests sat in the garden areas till the early hours of the morning was not ideal. I stayed on a Sunday night and again the same week and it was the same again. The hotel is tired and needs updating, and judging by the number of guests it would appear I am not alone in my thinking. The deal was okay but for my next visit to Warrington area I went elsewhere! 
0; This hotel had a lot to offer but one or two things made it less than a four star experience. We booked through Secret Escapes who told us to ring beforehand to book a table for the inclusive dinner and spa treatments. This we did at the same time asking if the rooms had kingsize beds as I had a broken arm which needed support with a pillow leaving not a lot of room for my husband in a standard double. I was told they were all doubles but they would arrange for us to have a room with twin beds zipped together to form a kingsize. On arrival I said I had forgotten what time we had booked dinner only to be told that it wasn't booked, secret escapes had not passed on the information! I explained that I had personally called to do this. It was not a problem as the hotel was very quiet but it did seem a bit disorganised. We were checked in and told where our room was but no offer was made to help with luggage which as I was only one armed was not particularly helpful. When we found our room it was a standard double. We went back to reception who said they had no note of my request. The receptionist said all the rooms were kingsize beds, which they plainly weren't. We were offered a twin with the beds pushed together but they were not made up as a kingsize as I had been promised. Other than that the room was very well furnished with a beautiful bathroom. Once again we were left to bring our luggage back downstairs ourselves.  The spa was really lovely, however the changing rooms were woefully inadequate. There were only two cubicles formed by a curtain pulled around with a single chair and no hooks etc. this meant that in order not to get everything wet everything had to be piled onto the chair. Once again because of the problems with my arm it made changing quite difficult as I find it easier to put tops on sitting down! There were no benches in this part of the changing room either although there was one in the adjoining room which housed the showers. I would also have expected from a spa of this quality for a spin dryer to be available for swimming costumes, although wetbags were provided. We enjoyed our stay in this hotel but it could have been better. Staff however were very pleasant and breakfast was extremely good. 
0; We stayed for one night at the Richmond Gate Hotel mid December after failing to get into the Petersham our first choice. We were met by a young chap in reception who had a big smile and a very nice attitude. The upgraded room was really nice with a huge bathroom and a large comfortable king size bed. There was a nice frontal view with a glimpse of the Thames in the distance. After a busy day in Richmond watching the rugby, we ate at an italian restaurant and caught a taxi back up Richmond Hill, the driver was the most ignorant taxi driver we have encountered and really didn't want the small £3 journey to the hotel although I gave him a fiver, he groaned at having to give me change for my twenty. A night cap in the hotel is extremely expensive my advice is go straight up to bed. Next morning we were horrified to find that one of the coffee cups had been previously used and was left with someone elses dregs. The only other dissapointing element of our stay was the breakfast plates were stacked on the table and not in a plate warmer. The bacon was sacrificed and cold by the time you got to your table. However my wife ordered porridge which was freshly prepared and came from the kitchen piping hot. Breakfast was taken in the conservatory which was really nice and airy. There was a wedding party there for the weekend who all seemed to enjoy their experience it looked well organised with management and staff looking after their every need. Expecting more for the rate I paid but I only booked 2 days before and was glad to get the room at all leading up to Christmas. All the staff we encountered were exceptionally good and attentive. Will I use it again, probably not. 
0; Upon arrived first impressions were pretty good, the location was good, and the complex looked impressive for me and my girlfriend, we checked in and I was asked for my credit card which they said would just be authorised for future payments, before entering my pin I checked the amount which was £150 but was assured nothing would come out of my account so I entered my pin, this played on my mind so I checked my bank balance and as I suspected am amount of £150 have been claimed (reserved) from my account, this wasn't an issue but for some it may have been.  We were given our room card and given directions to our room, the room was clean and tidy with a large TV and patio, the bathroom was clean and tidy, we got changed and decided to go to the Spa for a few hours to pass a little time, we were given towels and the locker pass also, once again nice and clean in the changing rooms.  We entered the pool and noted some children which appeared to be unsupervised who were diving into the pool with no regard to other guests the pool attendant who looked about 15 wasn't really paying as much attention to this at first and they were going into the sauna alone which apparently was forbidden for anyone under 16 I later learnt, we had a good few hours despite the slight distraction.  We went to the main bar in the restaurant in the evening and had a few drinks then decided to go back to the main hotel which was only some 20 yards away and have a few more in the hotel bar, there was probably a good 10 people already in there but no sign of any one tending the bar, a fellow guest went to the reception and asked if he could be served it took a good 10 minutes for anyone to come and serve us all by this point we got our drink and decided to retire for the night as we didn't want to have to wait that long again, if the bar was empty I would have understood.  The next morning we got up and went to the restaurant and had a full cooked breakfast which was really nice then back to the room to pack and checkout.  We arrived at reception and settled the bill in cash, it was at that point that reception advised me that the amount they had reserved on my account would not be back in my account for 10 days which to be honest I was not too impressed with as this was not mentioned to me when they asked for my card initially.  In future I will not be giving my card over and will simply opt as always to pay the bill in cash which was my intention anyway. 
0; For location and friendly staff, you couldn't get better. It was the room that let it down. The heating didn't work, there was a loose wire in the bedside light which made it flick on and off and the kettle leaked water from its base. All of these could have been rectified if I had the inclination to complain and the time to wait for housekeeping or maintenance, but I chose to ignore these issues. So I can't complain really. But I do expect better standards from a hotel of this rating. Maybe I was unlucky, or maybe the fact that the lift broke down on the way out said it all. An old hotel that needs some further attention in certain areas. 
0; The Wood Norton is in a nice location with nice grounds. We booked a room in the Pear Tree Mews which is an external building, however looks to be newly refurbished.   The room itself was quite basic, and didn't have any tea/coffee making facilities. The bed was large, however the room has no air conditioning, and for some reason the heating was on with radiators left on max, something that we found out in the middle of the night.   Breakfast was substantial, however some items were overcooked such as the eggs and hashbrowns.   Overall it's was a nice stay and made a change from similar offerings at the larger chains. 
0;we booked a premium room that came with 4 poster bed, whirlpool bath, robes, slippers etc... upon arrival we were told we had been upgraded further to a deluxe room, wow we thought this is going to be amazing? Nope, it was a basic room (107) lovely but basic. We actually asked to be downgraded back to the room we had booked, now that room (110) was lush, cracking views from the 2 windows, loads of space, great bed. Dinner was lovely with the exception of the soup starter coming out almost cold. The service in the bar was very good but the cocktails quite frankly were terrible. Got a fab nights sleep and breakfast was brill with plenty of options. The spa was lovely and clean with lots to do.
0;Nice hotel near the station. However over priced for the quality of the room and place. The staff were not very friendly. Ordered room service but quality of food was mediocre. Would think twice to sty here again.
0;stayed for a night with the wife, greeted very well on check-in by by friendly staff. our room was a little dated / tired looking but was fairly comfortable.used the pool which boasted a steam room and sauna . the hotel also had spa treatment and a gym which looked o.k .. the restaurant was good , food alacarte or self service carvery.. a nights sleep was disturbed by people coming back to their rooms , and a yappy dog. not a bad golf course for those interested. overall not a bad expierience but the hotel could benefit from some t.l.c .
0; A hotel which presents two different faces. On the one hand the restaurant is excellent in terms of choice, quality, and prompt, polite, and efficient service. Breakfasts especially good and matches any other flagship Hilton Hotel. Reception pleasing on the eye, nicely furnished, with any number of easy, comfortable chairs. On the other hand my ground floor room (rear of the hotel) was dark, gloomy and, frankly, depressing. View from both windows - a very close high wall. Had I been stopping longer I would have asked for a change of room. Lay-out of the room fine but furnishing in need of renewing: the room had a tired feeling. WiFi throughout the hotel generally good. Would I return - probably not!! 
0; We were on a b&b touring holiday in Cornwall and decided to treat ourselves to some luxury for our wedding anniversary. I booked dinner, bed and breakfast so we could relax in the hotel.  The place wasn't quite 'finished.' We didn't have a number on our room door. The refurbishments seemed to have got the the end of the corridor close to us. There was also 'junk' lying around the corridors - cases, clothes on racks, etc.  The receptionist was friendly and welcoming when we arrived though the next day was her last at the hotel. She showed us to our room which was a Joyce Nankieval room at £225 per night including the dinner. The room was pleasant enough but I was expecting it to be a little more refined for this price. There was an iron and ironing board in the room. The en-suite bathroom was large.   The breakfasts and dinners were delicious. The head waiter was very helpful and the staff efficient. It was pleasant to sit in the bar area after dinner.  The hotel is set in nice grounds and in there are descriptions of local walks in the hotel book the rooms. The walk along the cliffs to St Agnes was lovely though we did it on a warm and sunny day.  Two gripes. One was the 'supplements'. There were supplements for breakfast and supplements for dinner. To be looking at the menu and contantly hassled for more money was annoying.  Second was the dress code or the absence of an owner's dress code. The booking confirmation letter requested that gentlemen wear 'structured trousers' in the restaurant and the equivalent for women. I assume they meant no jeans. However having made the effort it was annoying to have the owner wander in and out of the restaurant during dinner and serve us in the bar in clothes that would have looked under dressed for weeding the garden - in fact it looked as though that may well be where he had come from.  The hotel needs a lot more effort put in to make guests feel as special as the prices would seem to indicate they will. 
0; It's big. Very big. Spread across other buildings that all seem to be connected to the hotel, not physically but in spirit in an odd out of the way complex of sharp cornered complexes and soulless shapes. No atmosphere whatsoever. They've tried with the lighting and the decor is for the most part modern but the central bar/diner/restaurant areas are too shabby in places not to offend the eye. The food is variable, better with the starters, the poached egg on rosti is a real stand-out but I suspect they have a machine for that. Breakfasts are average, warm and corporate tasting. The rooms are clean but a bit bland too. Main courses try but don't convince. Too much faff and not enough flavour or freshness. Whoever makes the bread at 4am is a gifted soul though, and dedicated too. Bar staff are friendly and characterful. Staff are all very friendly and welcoming. I'll stay there again but hope next time to see why its almost always fully booked. 
0;Arrived on a cold sunday afternoon, parked in hotel carpark and found they charge £5 per day parking fee for residents. Non Residents£10 per day This was so disapointing, why should residents have to pay extra for parking?  Room was small, and cosy with view of river.( Bright colour scheme) No biscuits with tea and coffee facilities was disappointing. No Wifi in bedrooms only in communal area. Restaurant very impressive, however food was average.  I ordered fish with a portion of chips (extra £2:50) and received 5 chips.  Staff friendly, mostly polish.   The £25 charge for 5 days parking was the sting in the tail!  Personally prefered the Barns Hotel.
0;" I have stayed here a couple of times before and was very disappointed on this visit. The entrance has never been much to look at, but the carpet beyond the security door was filthy. Rooms are pleasant. Small, comfortable and clean. They advertise the package with breakfast - but there is no dining room. Instead you are directed to a cafe across the road. On my first visit I was told I needed a voucher. No such voucher had been offered. On my second visit, tables had not been cleared for some time and I was ignored for ten minutes. I left. On this stay I was out most of the time; however, if you want to spend time in the hotel there is no public space and no bar. You wouldn't want to spend any time in the small rooms. In essence you are in a Travel Lodge, but you are paying prices at 4 star levels. I won't be back. "
0; We are so close to giving this place a good rating. The barman was unfriendly at the start and then warmed up. But, why not be friendly from the start? Greet people warmly... please. The chef that made the lamb... fantastic. Well worth the price. The dessert.... avoid! Stewed fruit. Terrible. The paper thin walls are terrible if someone puts a TV on. I phoned the reception to complain and to be fair, the customers people next door turned their T.V. off. Not fair on them and not fair on us to have to wake up from a blaring T.V. There's so much potential at this place. We weren't invited to see a spa or pool, so I don't know what we missed. 
0;Went to Tattershaw after very good reports by work colleagues. Booked at the same time with another family we booked a 6 birth caravan. The other family booked a 6 birth caravan. When we arrived we were given a map with our caravan location they were in different parts of the site which was not a problem. After unpacking we checked out each others caravan.There was vast difference in quality and cleanliness and size of caravans. Which was annoying because we had more people in our caravan which was stated on the booking forms. Also a slight peeve was the other family in the other caravan got a little pack with a bin bag and washing up liquid (which would of been useful as we forgot to bring some) but we never got one. The caravan which we was in was very tired and not the cleanest. Anyway on to the positives the setting are stunning the staff work hard lots of things to do. We ate on site one night which was passable not brilliant but ok. The bar area gets very busy lots of families we didn't stop out long because we have a young family.My daughters loved the little beach area (great idea). Swimming pool was a bit small but ok. I never fished there but the fishing lakes looked great.The upstairs bar was great with views out to the main lake very nice having a beer looking out to the lake watching the water skiers.In all a nice stay baring the caravan. I think if i went again i would choose the cabins which looked very nice with hot tub on the veranda.
0;Stayed here all day for a wedding, the wedding was awesome, venue was great and handled really well. The bar is over priced as you'd expect, the rooms are decent but there is a smell that was pungent, a drainage type smell that was really unpleasant. Our room was particularly bad. Breakfast was an ordinary hotel breakfast with an ounce of chaos thrown in, no real organisation about it . would not recommend or stay over again.
0;" Have you ever been to a hotel where the post-code does not appear on a sat-nav? Where the published directions and the directions supplied by Reception do not tally with any electronic device? Where the car park is over-grown, where once it was beautifully manicured? Where the internal corridors have carpets repaired by duct tape? Where your bed-room ceiling has damp patches and the loo in the bathroom gently weeps onto the bathroom floor wetting the carpet. Where there is no clock in the room; presumably as time has stood still. Where the hotel was once a magnificent edifice but now is struggling to keep the noise of traffic out and the slipping standards up? Where the reception staff are keen to help but know they are on a losing wicket, especially when their bedroom staff come crashing in, even if there is a do not disturb sign on the door (and then chatter away outside the room preventing any chance of an early morning snooze...  IF...  You recognise this hotel, you have obviously stayed at the Alverton Manor Hotel... A charismatic leader could turn this into a truly wonderful hotel.  BUT... "
0; Strange set up in general, rooms good, bed very good, no restaurant facility and breakfast all around one table, bizarre.....really did not look like a Hotel at all, only just saw the little sign, i thought it was a private residence 
0;we had our annual Xmas party here & it was average to say the least.we had booked a 3 course meal @ £40 per head that really should have been a lot lot better. I cannot understand why the can serve you the starters & dessert at your table but expect you to go & collect your main meal.The starter was strange - luncheon meat with 2 small bits of black pudding in the middle. main course was roast beef which was fine but no better than any gastro pub !! the dessert was again nothing special & M & S do a better dessert. I will try to eat here again in the future as it is a nice place & it was very busy on the night.
0; Cards on the table, I don’t much like Manchester. Never have. I think it is because the roads strangle and dissect the city, which appears to be nothing a patchwork of multi-storey car parks. Perched with eagles view of 6 lanes of the A6 the Macdonald hotel occupies what appears to be a 70’s office block with a face lift. Once I found the entrance (from the ‘back’ of the hotel facing the station this isn’t at all obvious) I entered into an oddly claustrophobic reception and bar area, with a ceiling little higher than a Harlem Globe Trotter. The colour palate and décor belie the fact that it was renovated only 5 years ago, or was this an early attempt at retro? Either way it isn’t a pretty sight. Staff at check in were friendly, apologising for a wait of no more than 2 minutes. Slow lift. Big room (a room for wheelchair access), with most comfortable King size (possibly super) bed. Breakfast was self service (except for tea and toast that were brought to the table) and a good standard, again the staff were delightful. I asked for porridge which the chef made to order which was top rate (surely they have to in a hotel of this name!). Check out efficient, and I was back among the traffic fumes within moments… 
0;" Every centimetre of my hotel room oozes calculation: if the ceiling was any lower, it'd be claustrophobic; if the dimensions of the room were any smaller, they couldn't possibly justify the £170/night standard charge (less 10% purchased online); if the basin stand was any narrower, my toiletries would fall off; the WiFi worked, though only intermittently, so certainly would not have had the bandwidth for a video Skype call; even the towels are just fluffy enough. Unfortunately in some place the calculators have been a bit too greedy, for example:  o the toilet paper is ridiculously thin for a luxury hotel; o there is no loo brush; o the soundproofing both between rooms, and with the outside, is inadequate.  Otherwise the hotel is completely without character: a faceless place to stay in and then move on without any good memory. As such it is certainly adequately average, though vastly overpriced.  I'd add that the safe in my room was missing a key part of its front, so whilst it still worked, its innards were exposed, so perhaps an expert could find a way in? Whatever, for the price, I don't expect poor maintenance like that.  Food was equally disappointing - I expect &quot;lamb in two ways&quot; to have two interesting ways of cooking, not a pot of shepherds' pie and a mangle of red cabbage and lamb flakes.  This is not a place I will willingly return to. "
0;Stayed as part of a coach party. Room on ground floor down six steps. Approach looked unloved. Room clean with comfy double bed. An extra single bed made the room cramped. Smallish ensuite with tiles in dire need of regrouting. No air conditioning. Plenty of hanging space and drawers. No instructions for TV and accompanying key board. Breakfast was OK to the minimum standard of a modern hotel. Evening meal food quality and service very variable. Never seemed to have anyone in charge. Second visit to pool thwarted by out of order jacuzzi, no attendant and no towels. Wouldn't use again.  
0;I booked three rooms for a small family birthday celebration in October 2012. The four of us planned to arrive in in time for afternoon tea and then celebrate with a champagne dinner later in the evening.   On arrival around 3pm we were not allowed admission because of an ongoing private function which was overrunning. We were advised to go to a local pub to pass the time until 5pm when we would be allowed access to our rooms. Needless to say we were speechless at this state of affairs but despite all representations we were not allowed onto the premises until 5pm. Not what you would expect from an hotel with pretensions to quality customer care.   Consequently our plans for afternoon tea were ruined but, as compensation for our inconvenience, Stoke Place picked up the bills for the 4 coffees which we had at the pub. We were so grateful!  Not a great start to our stay but I 'm happy to say that it got better - the food was good and the champagne mellowed our mood. But overall Stoke Place flatters to deceive and could do a lot better in communicating with their customers. Why did nobody phone or email us when it became clear that we should not turn up until 5pm at the earliest? We asked the question of Stoke Place and answer there was none.
0;We called in to the Deer Park for a coffee. We went into the reception area and no one around. A plate of two sausages and some ketchup with a knife and fork on the desk but no staff.....  We went in and found a porter who said he would be delighted to serve us coffee. We sat in the lounge area but it was a bit cold.   I went back to Reception to ask where the toilets were to find the Receptionist tucking into her sausages. After finishing her mouthful, she gave me directions.  The Receptionist then appeared (just finished her sausages) and explained that they were having some work done and had to leave the windows open.   Coffee arrived which was excellent and lovely homemade biscuits. But we could have been looking for a wedding venue or an overnight stay.....the sausages may have prevented that! The Receptionist and the Porter were very pleasant ....but perhaps have lunch away from the public area?
0; For a hotel dining room the food isnt bad. Its not cheap. The burger was a bit hard. the slow cooked beef was nice. The 8 small garlic prawns for £11 were pretty poor. The huge fishcake starter looked gross. it is what it is. Two tvs with football on in the bar take it way downmarket. Maybe ok in the week but on a saturday night? whats that about? 
0; Excellent room with large double, couch, work table etc. Was a late company booking so didn't have a full selection of rates and was stuck with the Executive rate. This gave a choice of 5 extras including breakfast, late check out, extra Marriott points, free mini-bar snacks. Don't bother with the mini-bar snacks. Marriott say it's worth £24 but for the mini-bar and I was expecting the normal fully stocked mini-bar that you see. The stock ws however limited to 2 mini tubs of Pringles, Kit-kat, 4 bottles of water and 4 tins of Pepsi. so much for the macadamia nuts, and umpteen bars of chocolate. Yes, worth £24 but not worth it. Breakfast selection was not as plentiful as other Marriotts but still ok. 
0; Just stayed for a 3day stay at Doubletree Westminster. Its about 0.5mile from Pimlico tube station and easy to get to. Unlike so many hotels in London its on a very quiet street which is a pleasant change. Its also right beside the Tate Britain.  On check-in we were upgraded to an Executive room as I've HHonors status with Hilton. The room was fine - clean, comfortable and with a good bed.  I tried breakfast both in the main restaurant and also in the Executive lounge. Both pleasant - if you want a bigger fry go for the restaurant - if you're looking for a lighter breakfast the lounge is quieter.  Its quite a small executive lounge but pleasant enough- unfortunately it doesn't seem to be adequately staffed as it was left relatively messy with tables not being cleared for quite some time.  Theres a good bar/restaurant the Millbank Lounge- I went in one night for a whiskey. Quiet and comfortable. Theres a larger whiskey list if you ask for it - nothing earth shattering but a good selection. I didn't have any food there so cant comment nor did I try the gym.  As with most Doubletrees its clean, modern and the staff are friendly. Its not dear and the location is good. I'd quite happily come back but I do think that some extra attention to keeping the Executive lounge clean would be helpful. 
0;" To be fair, I did know the type of hotel The Scarlet was before I went but my partner particularly wanted to try it. The views are spectacular and the whole thing is designed to make the most of them. The staff are approachable and friendly but I'm afraid the bathroom was an issue. I don't really understand why some 'design-led' hotels put a bath in the bedroom. Or is that a bed in the bathroom? And to be honest I kind of knew they had those but didn't expect the sink to be in the bedroom as well. And even the toilet didn't have a proper door (it was a sort of glass swingy thing with a whole in it for a handle). I know it's a hotel for couples but honestly there are some things that are best left unshared. We had a 'generous double' but it wasn't that generous which I guess was why there was only room for a double bed rather than a king-size. It's a shame; the staff were nice and I wanted to like it but the point of a hotel is that you feel super comfortable and I'm afraid I felt anything but. Sorry. "
0;We have used Malmaison over ten times. Check in was great and we went to our room to find a step ladder in the middles of the room and an access panel open in the ceiling. Not a good start! Asked reception for a rom move and this was arranged quickly. The new room was not as good as the first room and the layout was poor. The hotel did lay on two glasses of Champagne as recompense.  We did complain the following morning and was promised a follow up but yet to receive the follow up. The staff were polite and great. The hotel is good for Piccadilly train station and the city centre. Perhaps we were unlucky with the rooms but we have now used another hotel nearby and this has proven to be better.
0; Stayed for 6n/7d but was treated like a regular customer (a friend traveling with me for one night got upgraded, not me). Quite noisy from room to room. Slowest elevator ever. Cleaning staff entering room despite do not disturb sign. Good food, bar and friendly staff, good location. 
0; We stayed here for 2 nights after arriving back in the UK after our honeymoon. The garden and hotel itself are beautiful and the location is very convenient for the city and cathedral. on arrival, the receptionist was very helpful and chatty and we felt very welcome. Unfortunately, other areas of the hotel seem to be slightly more lacking in Customer Service training. Our main disappointment was the service at breakfast. The staff there seemed willing enough but on both mornings, didn't seem to have any system/organisation as to which table needed what at any given time - they seemed to do the task they had decided to do rather than meeting the guests individual needs. One example of this was on the second day, we ate our buffet food and waited 30 minutes to be asked what hot food we wanted (and gave up after it still had not happened). Despite the not being asked, both staff were clearing tables with no guests on!  Unfortunately, a lovely hotel is, at the moment being let down by a fairly quick piece of training to get restaurant staff to put guests needs first - If this were to change I would recommend this as a place to stay but until then, I'm afraid not. 
0; 5th April 2014  Nine of us stayed in three rooms on the seventh & eighth floor.  Rooms had recently been refurbished to a very high standard and we all were given access to the executive lounge on the ninth floor with complimentary drinks and snacks. Nice touch.  We found the team largely helpful and courteous apart from the one restaurant waitress who served our meals.   We ordered nine meals including three kids meals.after a short while, one the kids meals arrived. It was another twenty minutes before the rest of the order was tabled and then we were one kids meal short which took another five minutes to arrive.  The young lady serving us asked afterwards, 'was everything ok' to which I replied no, the service could have been better.   She immediately went on the defensive asking, with a certain amount of attitude, if the problem was with her? (Which up to that point it hadn't been).   As she asked the question, my wife noticed her making eye contact with the colleague assisting her to clear the table. My wife felt the two of them had looked at each other as if we to say we were causing trouble.  I'm afraid she then got both barrels from my wife, who saw red, assertively accusing her of having an unprofessional attitude and that she should not have looked at her colleague in that way when engaging with a customer, particularly one who was quite rightly explaining their dissatisfaction.   More, should would do well to listen and take on board the complaint.  It's a shame really. It is clear that this hotel works hard to please and the action of one individual serves only to undermine the team and the experience.  Scored average. But for the actions of one person the score would have been excellent.  
0; Have stayed in this hotel several times when visiting Manchester. I prefer the Doubletree to Hilton Deansgate and other similar hotels on price and convenience for Piccadilly area, amenities and station. It really couldn't be in a better spot. The staff are great and the bar has a good atmosphere. The rooms are clean and well maintained. Unfortunately my last visit was below par. I'd checked in then quickly out to Chinatown so I didn't realize until I got back late that it was impossible to get hot water to the hand basin in my 5th floor room - stone cold even after more than 5 minutes. I thought perhaps this was temporary but it was the same in the morning. It was a one-night stay and I didn't want to hang around (e.g. for maintenance) so I boiled a kettle to shave. Perversely the shower could be set to scalding. I did report it at reception but response was rather lukewarm (an improvement on the water) and was told I should have called maintenance. Hot (or warm) water is a pretty basic requirement though. I accept that faults do arise but thought they might react a bit more positively. I may give them one more chance to redeem themselves or try another of the many establishments in the area. 
0;" My first visit and I was looking forward to being spoilt. As I have been driving past this establishment for years and finally could say I had been. I was soon to be brought down to earth with a bump. We visited as husband and wife with my parents. We were celebrating my Mums 70th birthday. I booked the afternoon tea as I was told that it may be busy so this would avoid disappointment.  On arrival I asked if we could sit in the summer terrace as there were better views here. This was not a problem. We were sat at our table and given menus. We all decided as planned on the afternoon tea. The loose leaf tea was brought to our table. I was surprised that the first cup wasn't poured for us by the waitress. Just a little touch I would have added. I was more surprised to be passed the milk jug by my wife as she pointed out some dried on food that had not been cleaned by the dishwasher. The cups seemed a little grotty too. I certainly didn't want to make a fuss as this was just the beginning of our afternoon. We sat chatting and when our food didn't arrive I thought that this may be a relaxing time and as we weren't in a rush took in the views and the company.We waited an hour and the food had still not arrived. A waitress then came to us and said she was sorry but the order had not been passed on as it should? Rather than say sorry and she would take something off our bill she just apologised. Apology accepted.  Our afternoon tea arrived soon after. it consisted of 16 assorted finger sandwiches (4 each) not many, 4 profiteroles, 4 macarons, 4 chocolate moose balls, 4 cup cakes and 4 scones with cream. It just did not seem worth the £17.95 per head.  Overall we were very disappointed with this &quot;experience&quot; as we expected something better for the money. No second chances where we are concerned. "
0; Promised a room upgrade pre-booking and on arrival we didnt get one this was part of the reason we booked. The room though was very clear and modestly decorated to a fair standard. The hallways and communal areas do strike you somewhat of a retirement home though. The food in the evening was really nice but the service was shocking to say the least. The waitress's avoid eye contact when needed and we were left with finished plates for 15 minutes at the end of our meal. Also we ordered drinks on arrival and only got one of the drinks halfway through the main course (we had a starter aswell) and the second drink we had to ask for again, glad we got the deal off groupon because we would have refused to pay following the service.  The bar well its a hotel at the end of the stay so we did expect high prices but I ordered a pint of lager and a small wine this cost £10.25 hotel or not this is extortion to boot I looked up the cost of a bottle of the wine my partner was drinking and it can be purchased for £6 online!!  The atmosphere for a bar area was dead this I put down to the positioning and the lack of people in the place probably down to the stupid prices, they would get more people and a better atmosphere and probably sell more if they halfed the pricing.   The pool was lovely cant fault that at all major ++ for the hotel as this was amazing everything from the changing rooms to the showers to the pool itself cannot fault excellent!  Breakfast this was much better but to be fair the food was buffet style help yourself so we were never going to be let down by incompetent staff!  I will finish with the area the hotel is way out of the way for Stratford if you dont drive or choose not to take the car its £15 in a taxi into startford but it is a beautiful place to go and walk around.  Lastly if you do want to go for a drink 5 min walk down the road there is a couple of pubs with fantastic buzz about them we really enjoyed and to top it is off we got change from £7 for our 2 drinks brill!  All in all the stay was OK but thats the best I can say and I would not go back or recommend the place to others. 
0; Beautiful hotel with friendly staff , rooms amazing and a free drink all set the evening off to a good start. Overall the hotel is outstanding however having paid 160.00 to stay then had to pay ten pound to park and twenty pound for breakfast.breakfast was standard buffet fare with cold bacon over cooked sausages , burnt beans etc certainly not what you expect from a top quality hotel. You couldn't have a fried egg as the griddle to cook them on had broke three weeks before and the chef had to cook them in the kitchen and he'd washed the pans now so you couldn't have one, even though there was still twenty minutes left till close. Had to ask three times for tea and coffee eventually going to kitchen my self and asking. If your going to charge extortionate prices at least give good quality food and good staff. If you got 190.00 to spend on a hotel spend it somewhere else 
0; It's basically an old slave traders house that's been turned into a boutique hotel. Or so I found out from going to the museum in the town.  The bed was comfortable and the staff were polite enough. The complementary breakfast was a bit naff. All in all it was nice for a cheap night. Parking is an issue though you have to pay & display & it's very pricey. 
0; Staff were polite and helpful, rooms was average, bottled water in the room looked complimentary but was in fact £2.50 pr bottle! and £26 for breakfast is more than a bit steep. This is a hotel for those on company expenses. 
0;Attended the new years celebration and stayed over . Staff lovely ,Truly excellent rooms and enjoyed the evening . Food in the gastro pub excellent and good value . New years eve Gala food not to everyones taste -(particularly the venison course and desert ),although i enjoyed it ,but a very enjoyable evening .Band ,(particaularly saxo player very good) .so would do it again .  Our biggest problem was that hot water in our room was out from 8.45 am and took an hour to fix just when we wanted to get ready to go to breakfast .These things happen but it should have been sorterd quicker and this spoiled our experince .
0; I stayed there on business for two nights the location in Leicester is perfect for the city centre with parking out the back, The room for size was great but I felt it was a bit tired in need of a good spruce up, the heat was unbearable though for sleeping with no air conditioning. The potential for a luxury hotel is there just needs a bit of money spent on it to highlight original architecture. Staff were very friendly and helpful breakfast was average the food could have been hotter typical buffet. 
0;Enjoyed the hotel facilities staff very good, rooms large and clean and breakfast good. Only down side was Blakes restaurant which is part of the hotel, without to many details If you book there avoid the restaurant I did not listen to people on trip advisor so I got what I deserved. Anyway liverpool is buzzing and people very friendly, will be returning soon.
0; This was my 3rd stay at a hallmark hotel. The first time at this particular one.  First appearances were good but I was disappointed as the stay went on.  Firstly the room we was given was very hot. We felt uncomfortable having the windows any more open then the security bar as we were on the ground floor right upon the car park so the view wasn't great either.  Upon using the complimentary spa, we found it was very grubby. The jacuzzi had grime built up on the tiles which put my wife off immediately so we didn't spend long in there.  It is good that the hotel is being renovated but it seems they are trying to do too much at once perhaps. Wet paint signs were around and our room had several areas of fresh paint and unsanded down areas where cracks had been filled.   On the last morning of our visit I was woken up very early between half 6-7 by a delvery truck reversing up to the back door and parked right outside our window.   Having stayed at another Hallmark hotel twice previously and both occassions being flawless, I just felt let down by the lack of detail on this occassion. Can't say I would be returning. 
0; Staff all very welcoming and the location is both practical and rather stunning vistas greet you from most windows.    Rooms however are a let down, noisy bussing electric boxes and an odd tapping sound all night ruined our sleep. Shower was poor due to lack of pressure in evening and no heat in the morning.   The room was clean but rather pokey and a little dated.   Conclusion: ok for 1 night, don't bank on a shower, no cat swinging in rooms.  3/5 
0; Nice hotel but the standard of room cleaning is poor . The shower head remained dirty throughout my two night stay and the complimentary fresh milk for tea and coffee in the mini bar was not replaced on day 2 . I expected better for the price 
0; Having paid a lot more than other hotels in the area I wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't stay again unless I saw a bargain as it wasn't worth what's being charged. The queue to check-in was very long as there are no automated systems used by other hotels. When I did check-in I wasn't given directions to my room I had to ask details about that and dining the guy seemed more interesting in getting money from me and a card to set a tab up with - no thanks! Drinks in the bar were massively inflated but there is a pub in the nearby terminal with more variety of drinks and a lot cheaper!  The room itself on the surface was large and looked very good but looks can be deceiving as I found dust all over the place and the bed creaked and mattress was lumpy especially in the middle of the double bed. The inter-connecting doors allowed noise from the neighbouring room in and this meant I was awoken earlier than necessary as others were checking-out for an early flight. Safe to say I had an awful night sleep! On the positive the three course buffet meal deal (can get a voucher from reception) was very nice and the breakfast was also good though the sausages had been overcooked and left out too long.  All in all I think your paying for a brand name but this hotel is not living up to the high standards I'd expect from that brand. 
0; When we arrived this hotel was heaving! Very very busy had to park the car a long way from reception. On check in we were then informed that there was only a table available in 20 mins or at 9.30pm which is too late for a meal in my book. We opted for the early meal. It was OK, but not very inspiring at all. Service was quick, in fact too quick. I got the impression they wanted us out as soon as they could! The room, was comfortable and well appointed. The shower didn't work properly and you needed a degree in electrical engineering to work out how the lights worked! The room was quiet and we got a good nights sleep. The breakfast was again OK but uninspiring. Bearing in mind we got a really good deal on Secret Escapes, it was good value for money. If I had paid full price I would have been distinctly unhappy. 
0; Stayed with my wife and 2yr old for a Saturday night in a deluxe double room.   Fantastic hotel, great decor and Beatles artwork, really nice room and helpful staff.   Downside for us was the noise from Cavern St with all the stag and hen do's enjoying themselves. The music went on until 4am so disturbed us quite a bit, it was really loud. Reminded me of stags do's staying in a noisy party street hostel for €20 a night. This night cost us £160!  Not the hotels fault obviously but did take the shine off the stay.   Would go back but I would definitely ask for a quiet room next time. 
0; The host was very polite and helpful the rooms are nice and clean and tidy. The breakfast was well cooked and presented but only one bottle of each sauce between all guests. The décor is a bit outdated and there does not seem to be much of a theme going on a bit of everything. 
0; My wife and I stayed there in July.The photos of the rooms over looking the race coarse with a outside area looked really good, but actually from outside need a lot of attention an some repair The best part of the hotel was the lovely gardens running down to the race coarse with a lovely seating area First disappointment was when trying to book for evening meal We were told nothing available till after 9-0 o`clock , she checked with restuarant manager who confirmed this. I said not happy get me the duty manager, he did not appear but they then found a table for 7-30.  The food was ok but even so early some items were not available what we had was ok but not as good as we expected By 8-45 restuarant was empty so eating at 9-would have been fun hotel Staff were OK but again not 4 star some not worth any stars  Breakfast was really good with great service so did leave on a high 
0; Stayed here as part of my Christmas party. Hotel was fine.   Exactly what you expect. Clean., average sized room. Plenty of breakfast options. Friendly staff. Loads of parking. Not located in the centre of town, but just a short taxi ride away.   Great value for money. 
0; Stayed on business early Jan 07.  Hotel was very quiet, not many guests. Check in was thus easy. Had an executive room on the fifth floor.   Room was fairly pleasant, a large double bed and a tidy bathroom. The presence of a iron and ironing board was appreciated as this is rare in most hotels.  Lack of deliveries over the Christmas period meant there was only one beer available on tap in the bar.. Not to worry, plenty of restaurants and bars close by.  The only big disappointment was the breakfast. The bacon had been left out too long and was hard and chewy, the remainder average at best.  Car parking is available on site but this is rather expensive and not large so may be a problem if the hotel is busy.  Overall an average experience and would stay here again on business. If on a private visit I would stay elsewhere.  
0; Cleanliness. Generally fine. But, there was an old toe nail clipping on my bathroom floor (Room 208) and the architraves were rotting at the base due to the amount of water that had been soaked up from previously wet floors . There was a pack of very old and mouldy parma ham in our friends' fridge (Room 220). The excuse offered by the duty manager was that the reception desk trigger for opening fridges is intermittent and they are often not aware of when the fridges were opened last. This would explain the age of the food in the fridge but doesn't excuse it in my view. No offer of compensation was made despite these two issues but we have been assured of a response of some kind from the duty manager, “Sid” . Poor TV channel selection and picture Quality. No on-site Parking. Definitely not a 4* plus in my view. Have since been offered a complimentary upgrade if we decided to stay there again. You don't get a second chance to make a first impression. 
0;" This was our second visit to the hotel,and returned as the first visit was fine but this time we visited due to a 'Groupon deal' and we were genuinely disappointed with the service and the hotel in general. The room whilst a good size, hadn't been cleaned properly; as we hadn't booked in the restaurant we had to eat in the Bar area; very impersonal, and pretty average food, certainly not suitable area for a couple. In the morning we had to queue and wait for breakfast,whilst staff did their best to accommodate the large numbers of people waiting,it did not leave a good impression.Sadly, we won't be returning. "
0; We are in our late 70's and have been to this hotel at least 4 times in the past 12 months. We like the room to be warm in winter. It was distinctly cool and the thermostat control failed to respond to any attempt to raise the temperature. The duvet was light and there were no additional bed coverings in cupboards so we struggled to get warm enough. Also the tea/coffee supplies had not been replenished but we got some more. V poor TV reception also and impossible to get Sky or BBC. 
0; Look, this hotel is fine, but is extremely tired and 80's in look and vibe.  You wont have any problems here but not a destination hotel to get excite about by any stretch of imagination.  Bar service was good and ordered some pizza in the bar which were good also 
0; Nightmare to park - in the end just managed last tight space . Front desk, friendly and good as you expect at the marriott but other service at the bar and at breakfast was ok I would say slightly disinterested. No usual nice touches for regular marriott users like myself- no newspaper offered for example. The decor is a little tired. Read about spa treatments in advance but when I approached the area I was put off. Nothing interesting happening so went down the road to Cumberland where at least they are trying to create an atmosphere in the bar area. Room with a view was ok but just a bit disappointing. You need to do more to get me to return. 
0; The hotel looks like a motorway roadside hotel on arrival and the rooms are ok but not 4*  No mini bar for refreshments, £4 surcharge to order drinks to room, £8 got ice! Big hole where the mini bar fridge would be.   The breakfast was nice. The rooms were clean.   The dinner was not of a very good standard, not for a two star rosette restaurant. The steak had been poached in water, was soggy and flavourless.  The staff were helpful and did not charge for this but I was surprised if this is the second best restaurant on the island.  Very surprised it was offered by secret escapes as it was not too their usual standard.   On the whole the staff were great and helpful but not the standard of accommodation and dining we were expecting.   
0; This hotel isn't all bad but it wouldn't be my first choice (or even top ten when in London).   The hotel is well located less than 30 seconds walk from Great Portland Street tube. It is also clean and the staff are quite friendly.   However, the standard ‘superior’ rooms are small. Due to the shape of the hotel (a cross) the standard rooms are squished into the arms of the cross which make the small rooms a funny shape.   The first room I was given was on the 7th floor. The bathroom was so small and poorly set out that I had to stand on the toilet to get in the shower. It was a hot day in London so I left the aircon on. When I got back to my room a few hours later I found that the air con was dripping. The hotel staff made the problem worse and I was forced to move rooms. I wasn't pleased given that I had unpacked and had to repack. I was not offered an up grade for my trouble. The second room was smaller but the bathroom was a more sensible shape.  For a four star hotel it is light on facilities, with no swimming pool etc. The rooms themselves are basic with thin towels, no slippers or robes and no free water.   I didn't eat at the hotel or nor did I feel like paying the £20 plus for breakfast.  All in all not worth the £140 plus I paid for the room! 
0;" My wife and I booked a last minute weekend away and decided upon this hotel, as it was a Marriot we knew it would be a nice hotel. After a long journey stuck in traffic we arrived to find the car park &quot;no need for reservation&quot; to be full we had to double park and leave the keys with a porter. We then checked in and was told where our room was, we had to walk past the bins from a Thai restaurant and then get a lift to our room, the room was very nice apart from the smell of Thai food. Our last day our room was not cleaned and bed not made , on our way to dinner we told the receptionist who said they would get it done straight away , around 3/4 hours later we returned to our room to find it still had not been cleaned/made. Due to these small things I very much doubt I will stay there again which is a shame because the main building is beautiful with stunning views. If when booked we were made aware we might be staying above a Thai restaurant and the room been cheaper than I would have been happy but to spend £200 per night to stay above a restaurant , walk past bins to get to your Thai food smelling not cleaned /made room is a joke. Have a serious think before booking here. "
0; Have stayed here quite a few times, whilst the hotel location is very nice, felt that the rooms and corridors are showing signs of wear and the Deluxe room we were given was quite shabby, frankly, have stayed in nicer Premier Inns! 
0; Lovely hotel, the spa is great, the dinner and breakfast were both excellent. But £239 for a superior room with a bathroom which had a shower in the bath and was so tiny, in order to save space, the loo roll holder is actually attached to the side of the bath? The room itself was pleasant enough but I've stayed in far better and bigger rooms for considerably less. 
0;This was my fifth stay at Park House. As always the cottage room was clean and comfortable and the staff first class.  The downside will probably mean that this will be my last stay.  The breakfast on the Saturday morning was inedible and totally unacceptable for a a supposed four star hotel. Sundays buffet breakfast wasnt much better,The quality of both the cooking and the ingredients was well below last years standards and again proved very disappointing. This was reported to management but we heard nothing about it. An apology from the waitress really wasnt what was needed in this case. I really wish I had taken a photo of this travesty of a breakfast.  The bar and restaurant area was like a kids playschool even at 10 oclock at night.
0; We stayed here on a Saturday evening so we could enjoy drinks and food out. The Copthorne is pretty easy to find even in the maze that is Sheffield city centre, which has to be the worst signposted place in England.  We parked up (inclusive of the price) and checked in with no fuss, having booked via the internet. Our room was on the fourth floor and for people who are used to budget holidays, we found it to be plush and well appointed, or perhaps this is just the 'basic' standard of business hotels throughout the land nowadays!  The whole hotel has a contemporary, upmarket feel- although the bed was two singles pushed together and not a king size, despite being very comfy. There was plenty of hot water and clean towels although the wardrobe space wasn't overwhelming.  Having noticed the bar area as you enter, perhaps it should have come as no surprise to find a lot of guests (?) drinking on a evening although we weren't prepared for the loud music that permeated up to our floor on our return at 11.30pm. It went on until 1am and was a very repetitive bass thud which really ruined my sleep along with the constant drone of the air conditioning which refused to turn itself off and kept click-click-clicking itself on for some reason.  I have to say the Copthorne and the staff get nearly everything right but failed really badly in having a disco in the lobby area at a stupidly late time in the evening- I've no idea weather it was a private party or a regular thing but they need to be aware of how intrusive it is to people 4 floors up, who just want a quiet nights sleep after walking round Sheffield all day and aren't party or techno music animals.  There was some redeeming grace in the warm and tasty buffet breakfast come the morning, again included in the price, but if the noise is a regular thing then I'd be tempted to stay elsewhere in relatively less polished surroundings.  3 out of 5- spoiled thoroughly by the noise- everything else- great. 
2;"Decided to try 'out-of-town' for a recent London visit that involved a trip to the O2. This is a great location and very easy to get to and from, using public transport. Not sure how easy it will be with a car, but heck, who wants to drive in London? The entrance shares with the Staybridge Suites, so be sure to get the correct lift! The layout is modern and inviting, the staff well trained and welcoming and the rooms are well equipped and have very comfortable beds. The bathrooms are modern and attractive, but just one note if you have mobility issues; the bath sides are quite high compared to normal hotel/home bath tubs and so a dodgy hip or very short legs might struggle. All in all it was a good place to stay and I can only find one criticism, and that was at breakfast. Service ends at 10:00am and at 09:40 I was told that there was no bacon and no fried eggs because they had been &quot;very busy&quot;. Now anyone who knows anything about hotels will know that this ranks amongst the worst excuses ever. It was more likely that the chef decided not to bother and told the poor front of house guy what to say. I did point this out at reception and they seemed genuinely surprised, refunded breakfast and gave us a bar voucher too. In conclusion, the hotel is really cool, the staff (except with maybe 1 exception) are all brilliant and we thoroughly enjoyed the stay."
2; Arrived mid evening, impressively lit in the darkness, met scary Fred on the bench outside. Welcomed in by the reception team, straight to our room, welcoming card from the sales manager with two glasses of Prosseco behind the bar. Duly collected and menus given for a splendid meal with great service. Back to the room and a relaxing sleep in a really comfortable bed, breakfast at 9.30 the next morning, good selection of differing foods. Check out at 11 with a quick tour of the facilities before saying goodby to Fred as we walked to the car park. 
2; We planned a couple of days to break our journey from South Wales to the north of Scotland. A bit surprised to find there was a big wedding on on a Monday,we were equally pleased that the layout of the rooms/function suite meant that we did not hear a thing and had a very peaceful time. Lovely location,usual standard of room of Macdonald,excellent breakfast and very helpful/friendly staff in all departments. 
2;Very nice hotel. We stayed in a Superior Room with Kitchenette and it was perfect for two adults and a 16 year old. We only stayed in the room after enjoying the New Year's festivities. Checking in and out was a breeze. Beds were comfortable. It is a bit pricey, but what can you expect on New Years Eve?
2; Big, Clean, Friendly, Porters with top hats and coat tails!!!!   Top quality hotel and accommodation, great food and close to tube stations.  Let down by poor air conditioning as non existent, the room was very hot and muggy due to not being able to open windows, it felt uncomfortable to sleep in. 
2; We stayed here for one Night on the 31st March as we were supposed to be seen Janet Jackson at The 02 but she cancelled. Unfortunately I couldn't cancel the room because I booked a Non Refundable Room because I never taught the concert would be cancelled, anyway. Reception Staff were very pleasant when checking in, the young guy was Training and had some problems with the system he was using but was very apologetic and checked us in very efficiently even with the slight problems he had. We had a room on the 4th floor, 4011, no view and it was facing out the back Car Park but was very quiet. The room was spotless clean, very Comfy Bed, Fridge, Iron and Ironing Board. The Shower was over the Bath. The Hotel is in a great location for The Excel, 02 Arena with The Dlr just behind the Hotel which also takes you into Stratford if you want to do some shopping and London City Airport. The Emirates Cable Cars are also 2 minute walk from The Hotel. There are a couple of restaurants outside The Hotel, and a Tesco Supermarket. Didn't use the Restaurant or Bar in The Hotel this time because we went out in London but prices are typical Hotel prices. Didn't use the Spa but did the last time we stayed which was great and has a lovely pool to. The only Negative and it is why I didn't mark it 5 was We were woken at 7am by the cleaners. I appreciate they have to work but some guests like to have a lie in when staying at a Hotel and unfortunately because of how noisey they were, we didn't get ours. Overall lovely stay though. 
2; I was first greeted with a smile from a gentleman hosting that night, he was able to explain the menu clearly and how our dinner allowance worked, the same person was then able to explain and help us understand the billing process and how the dinner allowance worked with the bill, he had dark skin, tall and black hair, i think his name began with a K. Our waiter for the evening was a joy, he was cheerful, cheeky, and polite, his name was tamanda, and was one of the best waiters we have ever had. Overall from the host to the waiter the dining experience was great 
2; At the time I stayed the restaurant and bar area was undergoing a major refurbishment and was closed. They had converted some meting rooms downstairs in the basement for dining, which the staff had done the best they could to make nice, but it was still a meeting room in a windowless basement, so not great and a bit of cramped. Still the staff all did well and the quality of the breakfast was one of the best I've had in the big brand London hotels recently  The room was nicely decorated with a big bathroom.   As the hotel is made from a row of converted town houses, the corridors and number of stairs can be narrow and confusing.  Location is very handy for the tube - only a short walk.  Would stay again when refurb is finished. 
2; I stayed here with my partner for a weekend away. I think we paid £130 a night in total. That included a bottle of wine on arrival and breakfast. Not just that but we could fill out a slip selecting what breakfast we wanted and what time we wanted it & hang it on our door! The next morning they would deliver exactly what you wanted, right on time. The rooms were big, massive comfy beds. Perfect location for shopping! The staff were also very friendly and went out of there way to help us with directions and anything we needed.   If I'm visiting Manchester again - this is where I'll be staying. 
2; Found the room small but fine with no complaints about decor.   However there were two steps down, just behind the door, which we kept falling down as we entered the room. There was cosmetic damage to some of the bathroom fittings and a broken tile on the bathroom floor which could have cut unwary feet. Found it a little difficult to work out how to get the bath and shower working and some of the instructions may have been lost as the front of the tap/control unit (which may have had instructions on was missing).  The buffet breakfast was good and the entire experience was very pleasant.  The radiator under the window was inoperative at the time of the visit and the weather outside was very cold but after the heater was adjusted the room was quite comfortable.  Away from the corridors to the rooms which were a little narrow some of the communal areas of the hotel were stunning and the internet connection provided was excellent if the cable was just a little too short to reach the bed for surfing the internet whislt snuggled under the duvet.  Coffee cups once used were not replaced during stay but a very minor thing really.   All in all an excellent and good value base to explore London. 
2; I think it depends on the price you're paying with this hotel. If you're paying sub £100 for a night, then it's a very good option. Above that and it's just OK. The hotel is situated on the edge of Gay Village and surrounded by restaurants and fish/chip shops. A good location in Manchester and central to pretty much everywhere. The entrance is convoluted and messy, surely it would be better to send people through the v quiet bar area to check in?  The rooms are Ok. Quite modern, but a fairly obvious upgrade on the previous hotel. They've left in radiators whilst the heating is now via an Air Con unit, I can only presume the cost of removing the radiators was too high. The lighting is way too subdued and the bathroom was a wee tired. It was a very small bedroom, but just about suffice.  Other than that the stay was fine. 
2; We chose the hotel purely because it was one of the better looking dog friendly hotels in Bath City. Having not visited Bath before we weren't sure of the location but it turned out to be excellent. It's very close to the train station, the centre of town and of course the big attractions the Abbey and the Roman Baths.  The hotel is going though a period of refurbishment and unfortunately our room didn't quite look like the pictures look the ones on the website, but saying that it was well appointed with views over the square at the front.  The service was very good especially the breakfast staff who very welcoming and friendly. Breakfast is great with good choice of of Al a Carte options. 
2; Stayed in this hotel for one night with a family. The hotel is very close to Covent Garden and perfect for those who are going to a theatre and would like to stay over in London. Our room was a good size, had a small kitchen and everything that you might need. You can pick up empty plastic bottles and fill them in with filtered water found in hallways. The only complain I would have is outside noise should you be in a room that is overlooking the street. We could not sleep comfortably only because of that, otherwise I do recommend this hotel. 
2; My partner and I spent 3 nights at the hotel. The service on arrival (and throughout) was great. The breakfasts were great. We went out for dinner each evening as the restaurant menu looked limited and pricey. The room we stayed in was really nice, with a king size bed (standard room). We used the swimming pool, spa pool, Jacuzzi, sauna, and steam room several times - all of which were great. We had intended to have a few massages, but unfortunately when we called to arrange them 4 days prior to the stay, they were fully booked for our 3 day stay. The only other negative was that on our first night at the hotel, they were hosting a Christmas party on the ground floor until 1am that night - it was very loud, and we were unable to sleep until it was over. Still, I'd recommend the hotel simply for its service, breakfasts, and spa facilities. 
2;We stayed in one of the top floor suites with views over the North Sea. A big 4 poster bed, small lounge area with a couch & a large bathroom with a deep bath, shower & wash basin. Very comfortable, but then it should be for the price. Very friendly staff & the head waiter (Polish chap) is a great laugh. The restaurant is glass fronted so you can see the sea while you dine on their wonderful menu.  Parking is a bit tricky as this is in an outside barn near the hotel...perfectly safe but tricky to get into. Aldeburgh is a lovely town, with some nice pubs, art galleries & walks along the beach. If you like fish & chips you must try the Golden Galleon on the high street...to die for! We can only afford one visit to the Brudenell a year but it's worth it.
2; Had a room at far end of the long corridor, very quiet ,considering it is an airport hotel, room was fine. Friendly and helpful reception and where pleasantly surprised by the breakfast being available from 0430 for those on early flights, it was a good breakfast as well. Very helpful shuttle service to terminals and rail station 
2; I stayed at this hotel in August 2012. It was booked as a surprise for me by my husband for us to stay in the day before my birthday. Parking was easy and cheap, £5 for an overnight stay. Plenty of spaces to choose from. The reception was very clean and modern. Check in was easy as my husband had done everything on-line.  The room was very clean and some what elegant, huge comfy bed, lots of wardrobe and drawer space, TV, tea/coffee facilities ect.  Bathroom was clean, tidy and had a shower over the bath and all the usual little toiletries. . WIFI a little hit and miss but I didn't miss it for one evening! Indoor swimming pool looked good and was free to use! Never ate dinner there as we went out, but breakfast was lush, even had a surprise pancake made for me for my birthday by the chef, who brought it to my table, very nice touch. All in all a good hotel for either a business stop over, a few days visiting or if booked for catching a flight. Can't comment on price as it was booked as a surprise. 
2; Spent one night here on business. Rooms are large and clean, a very quiet nights sleep and a buffet breakfast , but you could have fresh eggs to order .What stands out most about the hotel is the standard of staff. Well done. 
2; Excellent surroundings and facilities in this recently opened higher standard hotel by the lake. The rooms are spacious with contemporary decor. The bathrooms are large with good suite and fittings, very large bath and large shower. The communal areas are lovely and the staff are polite, friendly and very professional. The views are excellent. We never made use of the gym and spa facilities, maybe next time. Dinner falls short of the excellent decor and facilities with a relatively small, standard menu. Good location with excellent pubs, shops nearby. Definitely worth another visit. 
2; In an area curiously short of pubs and bars, this is a really good find. On the main Queens Gate it hides itself almost shyly telling you with a small sign that it is actually available to visit! We went in looking for a drink and had to ask if there was a bar and if it was open - it was, and we were pleased to find it although for a while (at 5pm!) we were the only customers! Very nice wine and my guest had what she said was the nicest tomato juice she had had in a bar. It is a lovely bar panelled in lovely wood with huge pictures of the rolling stones presumably when they stayed there. The bar is really quirky with hidden corners and lovely furniture. A real find - well worth looking out for and only 5 minutes walk from Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall. 
2;Have stayed before and as usual lovely friendly staff large but cosy communal areas, smashing views excellent food, so relaxing from the daily grind, don't think about it just book. We shall definitely book again in the not to distant future.
2; From the entrance this hotel has recreated an authentic 1920s feel with fabulous spiral staircase to the upper floors. The dining room sweeps around the hotel with fabulous views across Morecambe bay and the quality of the food is excellent (albeit a limited menu, which apart from the fish course, does not change). Visitors should book a sea view room in this hotel otherwise you would miss a great outlook.  I would suggest only a two night visit unless you ae travelling daily to somewhere more interesting than Morecambe which has a delightful promenade but little else! The only downside of the hotel is that it lacks a comfortable lounge for after dinner drinks and relaxation. 
2; As a family of three stayed several night in late July in a family suite overlooking the lake. This is a good room to have, but not cheap, and its good air conditioning no doubt would have been beneficial in the July hot weather in the week's before our arrival. The hotel's position is close to all amenities, with secure free parking (free if you sign up to the hotel's reward scheme - no reason not to). Breakfast was good, and we ate one other meal in the bar, which was adequate. In common with some other large hotels, meal time with a large number of guests can stretch the staff's capabilities to cope, and I think this is the case at this hotel as well. One improvement needed is to the lifts, which were always extremely slow to respond and appeared to have minds of there own. I don't know if they were confused by the requests from the underground car park, but it could be a painfully long wait on occasions. Despite these comments, would consider going back next time we head up to West Lancashire. 
2; We've been visiting Sculthorpe Mill for a meal and an overnight stay for a number of years now, and stayed there again a few days ago. The Mill is in a lovely location by the River Wensum out in the countryside. There are two things we like about this place - the food and the staff. All of the staff we've met there have been friendly and helpful, which makes for a very relaxed stay. The food is also very good, either served in the formal restaurant upstairs or in the bar on the ground floor (or, on one of those rare sunny days, in the garden). We ate in the restaurant, which has a slightly more expensive menu, but you can also order from the bar menu, which is cheaper, and eat in the restaurant. Unlike many large hotels, breakfast is cooked to order and is delicious. (We were impressed by the effort they made to make sure that one of our party who has to eat dairy-free still had plenty of choice.) The bedrooms are on the top floor and could be a bit awkward for anybody who finds stairs a challenge. They are perfectly comfortable and the rooms we've had were spacious. To be honest, they could do with brighter lighting and a little bit of refurbishment but it's not a major problem. One thing to be aware of is that some on-line maps suggest approaching the Mill from the south rather than from the A148. Don't - it will take you through a very deep and potentially dangerous ford. 
2;" This hotel is excellently located for exploring Bristol city centre; about 20 minute walk from Temple Meads and round the corner from Harbourside. We checked in really easily and staff were very friendly indeed. Room was on the sixth floor with excellent views across the square to the harbour, but carpets were a little scruffy, with a coffee stain by the bed.  Breakfast buffet was excellent quality and with a great choice of sweet and savoury, including different options in a self-serve full English as well as pastries, breads and cold meats and cheeses.  Rooms need a refurb, but other than that, an excellent stay and good value for such a central location. "
2;I've been staying at Kelham at least once a week for business stop overs for the last two years so know the hotel very well. My comments are as follows:- 1) Staff are first rate. Very helpful and accommodating without being to fussy.  2) Food is very good. I rate the chef highly (although being Italian I think his Pasta dishes fall short) , with fresh products used and great imagination. It can be a bit pricey, but for the quality its fair. 3) The rooms are well sized and have good facilities. Some of the rooms are getting a little tied (Showers needs improving), but overall the facilities are good. 4) Location is great. You are in a lovely part of the country in beautiful settings, and yet only a short drive from Newark Town centre. 5) Drinks are quite expensive and choice is not great. 6) They used to have a lovely touch of a bottle of water in every room, but as a cost saving measure this was taken away a few months ago, which was unnecessary I thought.  Overall this is an excellent place to stay whether for business or pleasure.  Tony
2; Wife and I stayed in the Cottons Hotel and Spa for 1 night , we were going to a wedding down the road at Colshaw Hall .Hotel staff were very nice and food was good but thought it was expensive . This is a 4**** hotel but unfortunately there was a big gypsy wedding and there was a lot of noise and kids running around without anyone to control them and the same can be for breakfast . This place is not a cheap place to stay and thought we may of had something taken off the bill for the inconvenience 
2;Visited Oakley Hall today for Sunday lunch,4 adults and 2 children.Food was excellent,and standard of service good.Grounds and condition of hotel are superb.The price for lunch was good,and our 2 young grandchildren shared a main childrens meal and was plenty for both of them.The reason 5 stars was not given,was the price of drinks I think £5.00 for a bottle of Aspells cider was excessive,and £9.00 for a 250ml glass of house wine rediculous.I would definitely go again for Sunday lunch but stick to tap water,unless they lower the price of their drinks.
2;" Holiday Inn Hotels are another chain which suffer from consistency problems. You can have a great one (Birmingham, Bristol Central and others) or a terrible, terrible one (Corby).   The one at Filton is actually rather good. Driving up, you find it by leaving a short dual carriageway. The approach is not that inviting and the building is old and a bit shabby. However, inside it's bright and welcoming with friendly staff.   Rooms - 'Executive' - were welcoming, clean, well-appointed and comfortable. Spotless bathrooms and generally very good indeed.   Coffee in the lounge was served by very friendly staff and was great.   Bar service was fine and the meal we had in the onsite Thai restaurant was excellent.   I can't really fault this place. They seem to be doing what many hotels can't; making an older building welcoming and staffing it with professional, friendly & efficient people.   But for the distance from the City Centre, this would be a regular visit for me, but you can't have everything I guess...  I'll stay again for sure. "
2; stayed as a family group, and had received a booking 'offer' - this made it good value. not sure i will return without a similar discount. however, very nice hotel, good bar menu, and great breakfast it was a sunday, and i think we experienced a new member of staff servicing the bar.... just glad it was not busy! 
2; stayed here for 3 nights had a pleasant and welcoming stay staff were very friendly, price for b&b for our stay was a bit costly but then your paying for the location right in the centre of bath , 10mins from railway station and main shopping area,slept well no noise, breakfast was lovely nice and hot cooked when ordered,our room was lovely and comfy nice and clean. wonderful location to explore bath would stay again keep up the good work. 
2; We managed to take a room in the main building - much better. Staying in a cell to celebrate 5 years of a life sentence (wedding anniversary) was super. Rooms are extremely comfortable (a little dark) and great for a photo shoot for the memories bank. We we were disappointed that the visitors bar was closed for a private function which inadvertently gate crashed - spotted due to our dress code and age apparently. The hotel location is perfect for a short walk into the centre (we ate a nice Indian at Chutneys) and a 15min drive to Bicester Retail Village (don't forget your 10% discount card from reception). Malmaison is a lovely hotel, a little expensive and the communications with staff always a little challenged. 
2;" We stayed over New Year but did not partake in the hotels Maskarade Ball. The hotel was very nice & the food/menu although limited the evening dinner was also very nice.  This issues I had with the hotel were their bar lounge areas, as they a litterally a none event i.e. too small. The hotel has two bars-one of which is adjacent to the hotels reception area which is uninviting & drafty & is apparently only open during functions. The other bar is next to the restaurant & its lounge area is petite to say the least. The hotel does however have a large well appointed 'Sitting Room' but both we & other guests found the seating to be very uncomfortable. Most of the staff were very professional although one of the younger bar/restaurant staff who eventually served us prefered to clean the 'behind the bar' area before serving waiting customers, which I found a little annoying.  Finally, upon settling our account during our departure we found our bar & restaurant bill was in-accurate as we were charge £30+ extra for a bottle of wine we did not have; so check your bill. I cannot understand why with todays technology quality hotels do not have a customer electronic accounting system available that does not rip-off the customer; please allow me to invent one! "
2;The Birmingham & Solihull group of the MND Association, a national charity, held its Christmas Meal at The DeVere Village Hotel, Solihull last Saturday. The meal was lovely and I have received many compliments about the food, the service and the hotel itself. There were almost 90 of us and it is not easy to serve that many people sufficiently briskly and efficiently for a common remark to have been about how ‘lovely and hot’ the whole meal was. It did not appear at anytime to have been rushed, we had speakers between courses that seemed to dovetail with staff like it had been rehearsed – but it hadn’t. I fact another compliment heard several times was about how ‘relaxed’ and how ‘welcome’ everybody felt.  Several of our number are severally disabled and using both electric and manual wheelchairs. Access throughout was good as too were the toilets – all bright and scrupulously clean! We have used this group of hotels for a number of years now, rotating between Solihull, Walsall and Dudley each year. That we have remained with The Village Hotels, in each location, is perhaps our loudest and clearest compliment. A lovely meal, well served in a warm and friendly manner in a nice location, we could not ask for more! Thank you once again for a job well done – and Merry Christmas to all the staff.
2;" A totally unplanned visit, and a random selection on Expedia. Quite close to Manchester central. Broadoak is a warm and welcoming hotel with an excellent bar and restaurant. It is one of the cleanest hotels I have experienced which does highlight the pride that the management and staff maintain in their establishment. If you choose to eat at Broadoak, do Try on of the specials; the Chefs daily suet puddings are brilliant. If the breakfast was as good as the evening meals I would have to give Broadoak a top mark. Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did. "
2;Great location, slow lifts, the room was however spacious and well appointed having been upgraded from our previuos room which we had booked (a technical difficulty with the room) but they had phoned me earlier in the day to tell me. They also gave us a complimentary breakfast which was a nice touch, my only real gripe was the £5.00 parking fee, (the Vincent have valet parking). Overall the staff and hotel was very pleasant and we would stay there again.
2; Excellent course in fantastic condition. Rooms very clean and good size. Only criticism food choice was the same on both nights of our stay, Service was good and staff very pleasant and helpful. Would recommend to any golfers looking for a short break. Real value for money 
2; We visited the hotel for one night. From the moment we arrived, the personal service and little touches were in abundance. Great place to relax in a very historic setting. The standard of food and accompanying service was very good also. 
2; We love this hotel and have stayed there many times always choosing the same room.  The main reason for our return is the attention to detail and the staff. They are always knowledgeable and polite, willing to do anything for you and (most of all) they largely remain constant, unlike so many other hotels we use.  The rooms are spacious and will appointed, the spa, pool etc is very good, the food has been tremendous and the wines top notch.  A good four star hotel that I would recommend for that little break 
2;Spent a night at the Grand for my wife's Birthday, and I must say that the service from the staff was exemplary from the moment we arrived until we checked out. I am disabled and use a wheelchair so we arranged for the concierge to help us with parking which made our arrival very easy. Our Room was very comfortable, and we had been pre warned that our sea view would be blocked by scaffolding the only complaint was the lack of a vertical grab rail next to the toilet, which meant I had to use a low horizontal rail when using the toilet which was not ideal. We had both dinner and breakfast in the Hotel Restaurant and the food and service were excellent on both occasions  I would certainly return for another stay and recommend to others.
2; Stayed one night here on a visit to a family function. Not a lot of choice in the area so plumped for the convenience and location of this Holiday Inn. Made use of the pool and sauna which helped ease the stress of the journey. The room was clean and comfortable with a very good double bed and good sized television. No free Wi-Fi which was a bit disappointing but otherwise had an enjoyable stay. 
2; Place was lovely clean staff were helpful food was great no problems when I arrived everything was nice and smooth il definitely go back next time I'm there on business. My wife has also been here she said the same as I did nice clean which is the most important thing 
2; Restaurant Superb, Nice room, No lift. The only lift in the hotel is a wheelchair platform, which my wife and I got stuck on with my medical equipment. I got a bit upset when I couldn't work out how use the bath/shower taps. A nice Hotel, good service, friendly staff. Overlooks the Severn gorge a short drive to all the museums. 
2; We spent Thursday night here, we were visiting Liverpool to see the Lion King show. The hotel is in a nice building. the location is great with everything you need just a few minutes walk away.  Rooms: Spotlessly clean and clearly recently decorated. Everything is finished to a very high quality. The bed gave a very good nights sleep. Decent size, we couldn't fault the room.  We would certainly recommend this hotel. There are no breakfast facilities but it is a nice touch that they have a coffee machine and free muffin's in reception each morning.  Overall - very impressed. 
2; Very friendly and accommodating, especially with dogs. Breakfast excellent and very much a family run hotel. Location good and lots of walks nearby along the River Windrush. They are very happy to recommend other restaurants openly which adds to the experience of staying in Burford. 
2; We booked a 4 poster room and were pleasantly surprised by the fact it was modern, but was super. Enjoyed it so much that we returned a couple of weeks later when we had a great dinner and breakfast. Burford is a lovely town with pleanty of quirky shops. 
2;From the moment my telephone call to the hotel reception from the airport was made the service from all your staff was excellent,the room was quiet and comfortable the dining facilities was very good the staff for the breakfast were really friendly. I had a sirloin steak for my evening meal and was the best ever overall a great experience.
2; Impressive drive up to ths country house hotel, warm welcome on check in, late meal provided at almost 2200 with no fuss, large well appointed rooms, dinner very good. Could do enter on quality of breakfast and public room decor, a bit tired. Overall very good, would stay again. 
2; Stayed here for a long weekend in Windsor to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary. Honestly, we couldn't have had better treatment.  The hotel itself is very well maintained and everything in the room was fresh and clean.  What really made it a nice stay though was the staff. From reception to the chambermaid and the restaurant and bar staff, every one of them were so friendly and helpful. Full marks to the staff ! The waiter even presented us with a nice anniversary sweet. Thank you ! The only drawback was the £12 per night charge to park in the hotel car park ! What's that about ? Otherwise excellent. 
2; Great location for theatres and shopping. Rooms very tidy and clean - only drawback for us were the pillows - a little high but this is a minor point. Breakfast was great but service due to numbers of people was slow and our empty plates had to be piled up on table which restricted comfort. 
2;Everyone who works here were very welcoming and helpful especially our server and the room cleaner who were simply excellent.  The breakfast and the evening meals offered plenty of variety and the food was of a high standard despite there being so many guests.  Lunch was not included in our package but when we chose to eat here we again had a variety of choice with the option of an excellent BBQ on Sunday (and Thursday) lunch-time. Also on the BBQ days we were treated to an excellent solo guitar performance by the in-house band leader.  We came over a weekend and stayed for the following week till Friday. Over the weekend there was excellent entertainment either a comedian or a live tribute band. This was for the 'weekend specials' and to our pleasant surprise the high standard was continued throughout the week with not only guest comedians but shows from the in-house entertainers plus dance music from the in-house band and vocalist.  The resort is next to the coastal path and overlooks the sea. It is an easy walk into Yarmouth once you've crossed the busy road. This also means that from the ferry it only a 2/3 minute drive on the Yarmouth-Freshwater road.  Note: on Monday coaches arrived with the Monday through to Friday guests and so after a lull on Sunday evening the resort was full again on Monday evening.  Downside (simply comments to help if you decide to visit - which we will do again!)  Be careful when booking if you are hoping to have rooms near to each other, central booking appear to have have no idea of the site layout and despite saying that our booked rooms were close to each other - in reality they were at literally opposite sides of the site. Not great with a disabled 90 year old. To be fair, the hotel reception did their very best to find alternative accommodation for us and were very helpful and sympathetic. Our advice would be to ring and book direct with the resort.  Some of the rooms are in need of a revamp and should be avoided (the Kingston block in particular had very sad bathrooms) while others have been upgraded to a better standard. Maybe it is a matter of timing in the repair/update cycle?   The information provided when booking is not very helpful - for example the address/phone number of the resort is not included on the confirmation sheets -so be sure to have it written down before leaving home! Plus on arrival guests are expected to drop their suitcases by the car park entrance and these would then be delivered at some time later to your room.   This process is not made clear either when booking or in the emailed 'documentation' so this requirement at our arrival was a surprise. Early advice would have been helpful as we had not worried to lock our cases or bothered with cases that were particularly water proof - important as the heavens had opened on our arrival.There are no rooms that accessible by your car except a handful of rooms close by the reservable disabled spaces.  The car parks are not paved and are covered by loose gravel, there are NO marked spaces and frankly parking in the upper car park is haphazard at the best and care needs to be taken where you eventually park your car to avoid accidents or being obstructed. I would suggest parking as far away as possible in the lower car park as then you should have enough room around your car for easy access!  For this holiday we were with a member of the family who is disabled and so the final part of this comment relates to our specific difficulties with her. There are not enough disabled spaces close to either reception or to the chalets (8 or 9 in total by my count) with a few reserved spaces close by some of the chalets. It is disappointing that there are no reserved disabled spaces in the main car park that are closer to the buildings or the chalets. Plus there are no defined pick up spaces for disabled guests necessitating a precarious push chair ride or a long walk to where the cars are parked.
2; We booked this hotel for a two night get away to see the sights of Greenwich. WE found we had made the ideal choice as it was a short distance from the DLR station and so we did not have to walk far with the cases. It is situated close enough to all the Greenwich attractions but far enough away to be not in the busiest part of the town, but still within a short walk. The hotel was comfortable with very helpful and pleasant staff. 
2; This hotel is on a few sites including trip advisor stating that it is pet friendly, and I have stayed there before when it was. However, this is no longer the case. If you read the holiday in page it states that they only take guide dogs now., and even if you phone them and explain you have stayed there with your pets previously, they still inform you that they no longer allow pets. Hence we have had to find other pet friendly hotels in the area, and they loose our custom. 
2;"I'll echo most of the other positive sentiments about this place. Comfortable bed, clean room and for around £100 a night you'll struggle to find somewhere with a better location. Couldn't really fault it and would have been 5 stars if the &quot;fast and easy&quot; checkin terminal hadn't walked me through the entire checkin process before telling me I needed to go to reception and then reception issued me a key card for my room on the 7th floor that didn't work."
2; Best of the 3 Holiday Inns in Ashford. Room had Kings size bed,and was in excellant condition. Food in the Everning was of limited choice,could do with a better menu.Breakfast was great and set us up for the days travel in France. 
2; I very much enjoyed my stay at the Grand Royale. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The room was modern and clean (especially the en-suite) and had free wifi. Although on the small side there was still adequate space to move around freely and feel comfortable. The full English breakfast was delicious and served in a great setting. The hotel is also in a very convenient location only 10 mins from Paddington and a 2min walk to Bayswater tube station. Will definitely stay here again 
2;" We booked this with 'Easy Breaks' as a diner +B&B for £119 for two. Our travel plans changed and we were able to change to a day earlier than planed with only 24 hr notice. We were allocated room 701 on the top floor of the new building, which I must say blends in very well with the Jacobean main house. The layout takes a bit of getting used to with different lifts to different levels and the fact that the voice in the lift told you a different level to the one you really were on didn't help, but you got used to it. Room was good, king sized comfortable bed and a variety of lighting effects controllable from the bed, 50&quot; tv and good quality furnishings, safe, hairdryer, trouser press and Iron & ironing board. aircon & heating controls in the room & separate heated towel rail in the bathroom, and what a bathroom! Jacuzzi bath and a separate shower cubical with so many jets you got showered from every conceivable angle. Dinner was good, but service a bit slow because they had just had a coach party in that were running late, but 'Maitre D' could do better by keeping an eye on the restaurant rather that chatting to staff. We started with Roast fig with walnut & blue cheese salad followed by the Shin of Beef & Pressed Pork belly with fruit salad & Ice cream to follow. Bottle of nice Italian Red under £25 a bottle, which in a hotel restaurant I think is good value, but charging £3.50 extra for bread I found a bit odd and disappointing. Breakfast was first class with good choice from the buffet and a variety of hot dished available to order freshly prepared. I like a glass of whole milk with my breakfast which they did not have, but they dispatched one of the staff to the village to fetch some for me, so gold star for that. . We had a swim & sauna while we were there and were slightly disappointed. Gents locker room, there were a large number of lockers with no locks and a large number of keys that had no number tag so on returning to get changed had to try quite a number of lockers before I could find my cloths. Two small niggles, Key card was a bit of a Hit & miss to get the room door opened even after getting replacement cards, and upper lift took offence if more than 3 people got in even though it stated it was for 6 and could take 675kg. Overall a quite pleasant stay which I would definitely repeat "
2; Stopped for just one night, decor is dated but quite luxurious. For the price you really can't complain. I booked online and received 2 tickets for he Warner brothers studio tour with my booking, awesome! Gentleman on the front desk was friendly and helpful. Would stay again. 
2; We have stayed here before and had a great time, we came back again and had a nice clean room, that was nice and quiet. I wasn't going to review here again as did it a while ago but felt we had to give the chef that made us breakfast on the morning of the 17th Nov 2013 a mention. He was so helpful, along with the breakfast room staff. We are quite fussy on how we like our eggs, but we chose eggs benedict which is a first for us but it sounded so nice but we asked for the eggs to be done very well without any gloop around the yolk. He did this for us and even came over to us himself to make sure that all was well with it. He was really nice and friendly and just thought he deserved a mention. 
2; best hotel we have stayed at in southport. we visit southport quite a lot but this is the first time at the ramada. this was our wedding anniversary and as the weather was not good the hotel was very important. staff,rooms and dining experience were all very good and made our stay most pleasurable. 
2; Had a three day break using Tesco vouchers (didn't feel any discrimination) and were very happy with this hotel. Lovely hotel in a good position for visiting lots of attractions in the area, absolutely lovely grounds, with excellent swimming pool, gym, sauna etc. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the room was quiet. The breakfasts were magnificent and we needed no lunch and just a light meal in the evening. We ate in the Sports Bar one evening and the food was good. Helpful polite staff. Thoroughly recommend this hotel and will happily return paying full price! Only gripe is the charge for wireless internet - why? 
2; Stayed for a couple of days here with friends found it to be quiet at night yet 2 minutes to harbour.a special mention to the landlady nothing seemed any trouble for her. Rooms ok ours little small but adequate for a couple of days.our friends had the suite well worth the extra.breakfast had good service and good choice would recommend the poached eggs 
2; Perhaps the only hotel I know where the reception staff welcome you every time you pass. All of the staff were exceptional and made the stay a real pleasure.Excellent food and very comfortable. Easy access to good walks and the event we were there for was well organised    
2; I stayed here on an eBay deal. Staff are really friendly and helpful. Food is of a high standard and was always fresh and hot.   My only complaint would be that I was told it was a premium room but it certainly didn't feel like a premium. None of the windows opened and there was no way of airing the room so lots of condensation on the windows that was present for the whole stay. 
2; Close proximity to New Street station. 24 hour bar and free pool table. Food was decent and reasonably priced. Probably best suited to a lively weekend in Birmingham rather than a quiet romantic getaway.  
2; Nice rooms, super menu in restaurant, very reasonably priced. The staff seemed friendly even though they are in medieval dress all day :-)   Place is said to be haunted, I would agree, the place certainly has atmosphere,   Would certainly stay again, and would like to try another room, maybe in the main building.  All in all recommended, affordable, friendly and well located. 
2;Always a pleasure to stay here and have done so on a number of occasions. On the one stay I had an issue the team dealt with it superbly and I will definitely be returning! Definitely recommend this hotel.
2; A fairly recent arrival this is a modern hotel with excellent facilities including large comfortable beds and large windows which give an excellent view over the city. Good comfortable bar to relax in as well. 
2; good time warp re history, nice walk around grounds and down to river. afternoon tea was good. Dinner was average. Good place for short stay. Reception and porter are very helpful. Breakfast was good selection but the plates were too hot. 
2; This is a good hotel, in a good location if you're flying from London Gatwick. Three small issues - not enough plug sockets in the bedroom, prices at the bar are very high, and not enough staff on duty on a morning for checking out -- speed is essential if you have a flight to catch! 
2; The room was really clean and spacious and the bathroom well maintained - if a little cramped. Transport links a bit sparse - only real access is bus or car and car park is very expensive. Has a Costa on site (not quite so well maintained) hotel staff courteous and helpful. Breakfast area rather hidden away and serving area less than spacious but food was good. Good value for quality of room and area, would use again.  Staff were very good at retrieving passports and phone left in safe when members of our party found they had left them behind. 
2; This was my second visit to Mode and if I visit Lytham again I will definitely stay here again. I have stayed in two of the town's 'grander' hotels previously but much prefer Mode's informal and unfussy atmosphere.The hotel is small, clean and comfortable and the staff are absolutely brilliant - friendly and attentive. Breakfast is continental only, but the range of food available is excellent. Some noise from other rooms and corridors can sometimes be heard, but nothing too intrusive. My stays at Mode have both been in winter and the balcony doors of the room I've stayed in both times were a bit drafty when the sea breezes get up, but the thick curtains do the trick and I got a good night's sleep on both occasions in the enormous bed and the room was warm and cozy. The hotel is superbly located for the cinema, restaurants, shops and sea front. 
2; Overall, a pleasant stay. A reasonably good Carvery lunch . The Upgraded Room facilities were very good with a massive TV screen. Check in procedures are somewhat confusing with several automatic machines....much prefer a personal WELCOME . A single manned station is available if there's no queue - an unfriendly feature in my opinion. Certainly not too welcoming & maybe very confusing for new arrivals . 
2; Stayed for one night to attend a play nearby. 60 seconds from motorway junction, driving up our hearts dropped as the hotel looked care worn with dead plants in the tubs and an air of neglect. On entering lobby things got a lot better and our room was huge and very very well equiped - good bathroom/clean etc. Breakfast was great. Staff enthusiastic but sometimes a little slow. It was obviously at it's peak about 10 years ago but now needs a bit of a facelift. 
2; Stayed here Saturday night to meet family.hotel easy to find as we came on train.its about 5 mins walk from station.the hotel staff are very helpful and always smiling.checking in was so easy and fast.room is a decent size with everything you need.bar prices were cheaper than the pubs in the centre.breakfast in the morning was good with plenty of choice.about 10 min walk to shopping .would defo stop here again.thanks very much novotel 
2; We stayed at the Balmer Lawn Hotel for one night whilst visiting Brockenhurst. Having booked at the last minute we were pleasantly surprised to be given a room overlooking the Forest and adjacent cricket ground. We ate in the restaurant which whilst fairly quiet on a Wednesday night had a good atmosphere and lovely food. The following morning at breakfast we were offered a wide choice of items cooked to order which was a welcome change from the buffet breakfasts on offer at some other hotels. 
2; This hotel has great character nothing like you would normally expect for a Holiday Inn. A five minute walk into the town centre therefore perfectly placed for shopping, dining and the wide range of bars on hand. Stayed in the main building with an upgrade to a suite. Bed wonderfully comfortable, creaking floorboards and great food. Staff very helpful. All in all a great hotel to stay at. Definitely going back! 
2; I went to University in Newcastle a few years ago, so it was nice to return as a 'grown up'. The apartments themselves are very nice, well designed and modern. They show a bit of wear and tear, for example badly damaged wallpaper, but on the whole good. The bed is comfy and the bathroom clean.   The only things that let it down was the reception service. The welcome initially was a little less than cordial, but rather we were treated with indifference. And in the morning, we needed another towel, so I called reception. I left a message as no one picked up. Around 30 minutes later, I called again, and asked if my message had been received and acted upon - no and no. Another towel did eventually appear.   All in all, not a bad experience, but a few things to improve on I think. 
2; I have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions, but this is the first review. It is a grand old style hotel, with a nice lobby area, which is accessible from the inside of Victoria station, which is convenient. The rooms vary in size - some are pretty spacious, whilst some are pretty small, but all are of a similar standard. Breakfast is good, and most staff I have dealt with are friendly and helpful. So overall, a good standard 4* hotel, which does what it says on the tin! 
2; Arrived here last Thursday and stayed until Sunday (3 nights) on a bed and breakfast basis. The hotel staff in the restaurant and breakfast room were very kind and attentive. The reception staff could do with a little more training on dealing with the many people that arrive at the front desk by being more proactive. Liked the idea of the recycling boxes on the upper floors to take the unwanted paper, plastic bottles etc. Found that the wardrobe which was like one you experience when you are staying in an 'IBIS' hotel which just has the rail and coat hangers hanging, for you to display the clothing you have brought with you - but got used to this idea. The hotel is very clean and tidy. The car parking arrangements were fine, but it is best to leave your car where it is when you arrive, as late arrivals are often looking for car parking spaces. 
2;Was here for one night only whilst on business in London and found the room clean and comfortable. The breakfast was good even if a little hurried, (waiter nearly removed my coffee whilst I was away at the toaster), but overall a good stay. On leaving I was able to get some great photos of Tower Bridge as I left and I would stay again.
2; Our second stay at this hotel - the first being in 2009.Was here for 1 night in May whilst attending an event at the O2 arena.As with our previous visit , check-in,service,rooms,bar & restaurant all spot on. 
2; I booked the hotel Penzance after seeing a deal on KGB deals! And so pleased I did! On arrival had a lovely welcome by Peter from guest relations, a quick & easy checkin and felt at home from the moment we arrived! Peter helped us with our luggage as we were on the 3rd floor! We stayed in room 22 (up in the roof) lovely large room, with a sofa and massive bed! All lovely & clean with a stylish bathroom with a corner bath! lovely sea view from the window over towards penzance town! Loved the free tea & cake each afternoon- a nice added extra after a long day out and about! All the staff are attentive and helpful and very polite! Breakfast was completely scrummy with lots of choice! We had a lovely break away! I would highly recommend! Keep up the good work hotel Penzance! & thank you! 
2; After a long flight the short walk to The Novotel is perfect. A swift, friendly check in and we were soon in our functional, clean room, before a quick shower and some sleep. Woke early for breakfast, which offered a good choice. Another short walk to the car park adds to this ideal location. 
2; The Carlton Hotel gives the impression of an old country house in the middle of a town. The location isn't in the most salubrious part of Rugby and I certainly wouldn't recommend the bar opposite. However, it is a short walk from the Seven Stars - an award winning real ale pub - and also the town centre. I think that it's alleged 4-star rating is a little over exaggerated, but it does have a lot to recommend it. The room was spotless and well presented, the staff extremely courteous and helpful. The bath towels were proper bath sheets - always a plus in my eyes. The in room refreshments were generously replaced every day and the breakfast was excellent. The biggest minus was the bed. We had booked a superior deluxe double room but the bed was probably the smallest double bed that I have ever slept in. I would probably have classed it more as a 3/4 bed, it was that 'cosy' with both my husband and me in it! Another thing to be aware of, is that parking at the hotel is at a premium with few spaces and a very tight squeeze. 
2;We enjoyed our stay at Cowley Manor a few years ago and it was still as lovely as we remembered this weekend. Our room (Best) was beautiful with wonderful views and full of lots of lovely details, especially the Green and Spring products that smell gorgeous. We loved the spa too - especially love that the pool is big enough for a good swim and the walks in the grounds are also beautiful - so many majestic mature trees. Breakfast was also really good - with a lovely choice of fresh and healthy organic things from the buffet, as well as a very good range of cooked options. There are only a few things that could be improved to make it perfect: firstly dinner in the restaurant. Some of the flavour combinations just really didn't work ( bitter cabbage and barely roasted root veg with an otherwise perfect steak and chips, for example. Lots of slightly grisly chorizo and black pudding everywhere, huge cheese scones with a mustard salad dressing/dipping sauce as an appetiser?!) and everything seemed a little overcooked and lukewarm when it arrived on the plate. Secondly, the noise from reception and the entrance (phones, staff chattering, piped music, slightly merry guests, newspaper deliveries etc.) carries beautifully up the stairs and into the bedrooms, so don't go for a room in the main house if you want peace and quiet. Thirdly, the shop on site is really scarily quiet and so well folded and presented that you feel compelled to whisper and not to touch anything!
2;First the good. The service we experienced was uniformly excellent from all the staff. Attentive and friendly, just hitting the right balance. We loved the jazz trio playing in the lounge on Saturday night and the ambiance created by the large candles and subdued lighting was lovely. Parking was a bit of a pain, the NCP carpark was dark and pokey and expensive. Now on to the rooms. It was our choice not to go for a sea view but the first room we were given 434 was horrible. It had a frosted window and was one of the smallest doubles I have ever been in. We managed to swap up on to the 6th floor where we could at least see out of the window. The staff were very helpful in facilitating the move. The rooms as you might expect in such an old hotel are increadbly creaky. The whole floor moved when you set foot on it. We had a good time but the room alone is not good value for money, failings here are compensated by the excellent staff, the enjoyable lounge and the breakfast.
2; Having previously been put off from having a meal here due to a slightly pompous lady on the phone we decided to give it another go and we were not disappointed. There is a little touch of pomposity about the place but it is a very good venue and the staff were charming once you had settled into the restaurant. The food was good and overall it was very good value, probably not as good as Mitton Hall but it will always be on the shortlist for an enjoyable Sunday Lunch. 
2; This hotel's best attribute is its chef. The food is excellent fine dining. The room was clean and spacious with wonderful views of the gardens. Very relaxing for a two night stay. The only problem we encountered was the shortage of staff. The small bar is not manned and it's very difficult to find someone to get drinks. There is a very well furnished and comfortable lounge but before dinner on both evenings, this was still cluttered with dirty crockery from afternoon teas. the staff are very friendly and helpful but to have to see them clearly struggling because there are too few of them creates a disconcerting tension when either waiting to be served or having to ask for service. The hard work of the chef and the high quality of food here deserves better support from management. Nevertheless, we look forward to returning to see if someone has listened to this common thread running through other recent reviews. 
2; We enjoyed three nights with our 3 year old son and would return. Most of the activities seemed to be aimed at slightly older kids from about five or six i reckon though in the games room, golf etc. Would recommend place to everyone. I enjoyed the golf and my missus liked the spa and my son like the swimming 
2; Popped in for a drink/coffee late lunch, staff positive attentive and location is good despite being close to road, garden is very pleasant. Nothing negative to say, was very pleasant and positive, would return for lunch or dinner.. 
2; It was my mothers 90th Birthday and we chose the County for a High tea over the weekend for 26 of us. As long term Durham residents the County represents something much longer than its current Marriott identity. Their were 26 in our group from 1 to 90 and so we needed to cover a very broad range of tastes. The Event contact , given we had to arranged many months in advance to 'organise' people scatted around the country was excellent both pre and follow up . The whole event was well handled and the service on the day was very good , the champagne high tea being seen as good value by all with the cakes/desserts especially appreciated . The only draw back from an overall excellent was the sandwiches seem to have been prepared a little early on the day and the bread had dried out a little in some.  So several of us were a little cautious of a 'large' hotel especially now having the Marriott brand which can have attractions but also wariness of losing identity were very pleasantly surprised - very good job ! 
2; Stayed for one night on business. Near Victoria train station (10-15 minute walk), though if have luggage you'd be using taxis to and from. Room pleasant and clean. Reception staff friendly and helpful. Reasonable pub around the corner (The Clarendon). Breakfast nice, included in price, and served by friendly staff. Benefited from free WiFi Internet access - not very fast, but perfectly good for some basic browsing and dealing with emails.  Not a posh hotel, but comfortable enough and perfectly suitable for a one night stop-over in London. 
2; There was a large crowd in the restaurant one lad was wearing a bath robe and a pair of pyjama bottoms. We did make a comment to our waiting staff but this was just laughed off. He had also earlier walked through the bar with no shirt on. Ruined our evening and anniversary meal 
2; Brilliant apartments, very plush and well presented. The location is great and having a balcony just adds to the place. An on site restaurant would be great - as would room service and is only a moan as it's quite pricey at just short of £800 for three nights. No room cleaning at the weekend is the other reason for marking it down. Air con would be good as even cheap hotels have cooled air but they did give us a portable unit for the room which meant the balcony door had to stay open and the TV volume stay up (bit noisy). However, we loved it and will be back as the location, staff and apartments are excellent. 
2; A good standard of hotel, clean, tidy, well equipped and a reasonable location close to Tottenham Court Road tube station. I believe all rooms are small but this is not unusual for London. Free wifi throughout is good, bed comfortable and shower was hot and powerful.  The let down for me was the value of money. £100 for a one night room only at a weekend is too much, furthermore the bar prices are high (nothing new for a hotel) but 12.5% service charge is insulting for inattentive staff. 
2; Booked a standard double room. The double bed takes up pretty much the whole room plus there was a little table for kettle & tea etc. Toilet is pretty standard also. If you book this room in advance online on their website you can save about £6. Room was clean and cheap for Saturday night in Guildford. Only problem we found was that the walls were very thin & consequently could hear the couple next door... 
2; Booked this hotel as a base for a 3 night stay on our family road trip visiting the lake district.  The hotel is lovely, but the grounds/gardens and views out the back are simply stunning.  There was a slight mix up after check in, where we had been allocated a double room with only one bed for us and our son. After checking with reception we were given an alternative room with a camp bed.  The hotel is quite remote, with one pub a mile or so away, and walking along the country roads could be dangerous.  The hotel is a little pricy, and we only ate there on our first night, and the service was very slow. However, we were given a discount on our meal because of the delay.  Overall we enjoyed our stay at Leeming House Hotel, would recommend and would go back.  The views are worth the cost alone. 
2; I attended a conference here, and thought the hotel was very nice. Good general layout with many smaller breakout conference rooms, nice facilities and the hotel rooms are really nice. The breakfast was very nice too, with good service at all times. 
2; Stayed here for one night, bed, breakfast and dinner with 1hour massage package. Just walking around the hotel is relaxing , with robe and slippers on. The garden itself is lovely with loads of ground to explore. Pool, sauna etc are all great. The full body massage was good. The chill out room after was very relaxing and could of stayed in there for ages. Food was fine , with the package you choose from a set menu but can get a more expensive meal and pay the difference. We did have to carefully consider the deals they offer as some don't seem worth the extra money. Will come back if can find a similar package deal. 
2; From the moment you walk in you get a good feeling about this place, the staff are very accommodating and the rooms are very clean and tidy, comfy bed, great shower and fantastic breakfast make this a great venue, I would definitely stay here again. 
2; Stayed here on a Friday and Saturday in June. Rooms are basic but clean. Enough space for two lads with small weekend cases.  Staff were excellent throughout, especially when we told them we were on a stag do and may be returning late, there was always a member of staff to open up the door at various times of the morning.  All the other groups we spoke to (mainly hen dos and young groups of europeans) said they were also happy with the hotel.  As per other reviews there are cheaper within London that will do the same job and are slightly more centrally located in London. However, the London transport and taxi network means this is only a inconvinenience if you are walking everywhere. 
2; We stayed here for a week and they gave us a feeling that we were special. We were offered free cookies as much as we wanted and when there was aproblem with the internet they inmeadiatly placed a signal booster in the room. Staff is super friendly and helpful. The hotel is a little outside of sheffield on the south side and therefor also very suitable for a visit to Chesterfield as that's only 10 km away and the main road to there is directly outside the hotel 
2; My wife and I stayed for one night recently for a friends wedding. On arrival we parked in the large and easily accessible car park and made our way to reception where we were met by extremely helpful staff who quickly booked us in and directed us to out room, I can't remember the name of the room but it's on the first floor at the front of the building.  The room was a reasonable size, clean and comfortable, especially the bed, with a compact but perfectly acceptable en-suite. I note that some other guests have commented about traffic noise from the busy main road outside, whilst it's fair to say it is busy during the day the traffic levels drop dramatically after about 6pm and we had no problems at all sleeping with the windows open throughout the night.  The owners make a feature of the quirky nature of the rooms and the decor throughout and we found this quite refreshing, certainly more interesting than your run of the mill chain hotels with their bland decor and anonymous layouts, well done to the William Cecil for daring to be different.   Now, I am very much a steak and chips type of fella so the following should not be seen as a criticism of the chef but I think it only fair to warn prospective visitors that the evening meal was something of a revelation to me, and could catch out the uninitiated. I enjoy my food but I'm not used to it being presented as an art form, therefore I was more than a little surpised when my steak meal arrived and I was confronted with three very small pieces of meat neatly topped off with approximately four French beans, and the whole artistic arrangement was framed with a thick liquid which I am reliably informed was a jus.  On checking the menu I confirmed my intial suspcion that I had been presenteded with 'Chef's interpretation' of an evening meal. Having overcome my surprise I ate and thoroughly enjoyed the food but I could easily have accomodated a hearty round of fish and chips afterwards ........you have been warned! In fairness to Chef, breakfast was marvellous with all the usual fare, if you visit, make sure you try the locally sourced honeycomb provided at breakfast as even a fella with as uneducated a Palate as mine found it absolutely delicious.   A couple of other points worth noting, the building is old and has obviously undergone many alterations over the years which has lead to the need for a number of changes in floor level, and the instlation of numerous staircases, in view of this, those that are less mobile may be best advised to request a room on the ground floor. For those looking for a traditional pub with a fine slection of real ales, the hotel owns a pub situated a few minutes walk away which provided a very warm welcome and a wide selection of well kept and in the main locally sourced ales.  Would we visit again, yes definitely but I'll need to study up on nouvelle cuisine beforehand. 
2;I stayed here while in oxford on business. It ticked most of the boxes. The room I had was clean and comfy but was a bit small. I stay away with work quite a bit and my usual critera for the quality of a hotel is 'does the room have an iron?' yes it did - box ticked. The staff were courteous and efficient and I must say breakfast was very good indeed. I think the hotel must have recently refurbished and is trying to be a bit trendy (royksopp playing at breakfast, whats wrong with radio 2?!?!). The only down side is that I felt at 179 pounds for one nights b&b didnt represent value for money.
2; Easy to walk to from New Street or Moor Street train stations if you want to lose the car over the festive period. 5 minutes from the Bull Ring and Christmas Markets. Decor is modern and the rooms are spacious and clean. Had a really nice lunch here too. 
2; Stayed here for 1 night on a business trip for the Cricket at Headingley. Hotel is in a great location in the city centre and opposite the train station but with no noise from the Station. Checkin in was quick and room was very big with a nice size comfortable bed, and nicely decorated room. Did not eat in the hotel apart from the breakfast in the morning which is a buffet option with lots of choice and very tasty. Overall nice hotel in a good location and would recommend. 
2; Positioned just off Oxford street, this is a good location. A number of rooms are underground with a view of feet passing the hotel, the plumbing was also questionable in these rooms, although the friendly staff did all they good to resolve issues.  It's a hotel to use as a base to get out and about, not to enjoy a cocktail or relax in the limited space around reception and the bar area. 
2;Just enjoyed a very nice one night stay to do some christmas shopping. Very spacious room,which was immaculate with good sized bathroom and tv,tea/coffee making facilities . Nice evening meal in a busy but lively restaurant with good choice of menu.  Bad points. Breakfast service was very poor with queues waiting for fresh bacon,sausage,eggs etc. Shortage of staff meant tables full of dirty crockery,plates and no one to serve you extra tea/coffee. This is a pity because the overall experience was very enjoyable and would definitely gave it another try and hope the get the breakfast service sorted
2; Let me start with the good parts of my meal. The carvery itself was delicious, best one I've had. Everything tasted freshly cooked and nothing appeared to have been sat out for ages. The spread was incredibly diverse with loads to choose from and the carvery portions were incredibly generous. The staff as a whole were accommodating and attentive, however when we entered we were greeted by a rather unfriendly bar man. He was unwelcoming and, to be honest, it did offset the tone of the afternoon. That being said, I had a lovely afternoon and the beautiful surroundings in the shining sun were of course delightful. Could highly recommend. 
2; Overall great stay however visiting with kids (9 & 11) we were told - first minute we entered the hotel - that we could access the swimming pool only for 2 hours per day (from 8 to 10am only). So since all hotels nowadays are optimising their facilities, the Spa is actually overtaking the rest as a priority. Not really friendly staff from the Spa either, kids are definitely not welcome here (even well behaved ones). May be cause they didn't know I had booked a spa for my wife. So would recommend as a couple retreat but not a family one. 
2; I stay in central London hotels usually once a week, booking via Lastminute.com. I stayed in this hotel last night. This was my second visit to Tophams. I'd not had a great experience the first time I went but my second visit was excellent. The staff were friendly and helpful, for example I asked for a glass of water on arrival and someone immediately fetched one. Check in was straightforward. I had a second floor room, the decor was very nice, the bed was comfy and the bathroom was very clean and modern. I didn't have time for breakfast unfortunately so I can't tell you about that. The location is excellent, just a few minutes from Victoria Station. I would definitely go back 
2; Excellent location in centre of city and near Albert Dock. Friendly atmosphere, nice boutique decor. Clean and spacious rooms. Only complaint was hard lumpy pillows, both myself and wife woke up with stiff necks! 
2; Very comfortable stay with very welcoming and helpful staff. The room was very clean and was spacious enough. The hotel has kept many original features from days gone by which added a nice character to the place. The price of the room was competitive for the area but comparatively slightly expensive compared to other cities. We did not have breakfast as it was relatively expensive when you can step out into the city centre for a much better deal. The hotel did a reduced price for car parking at one of the city centre car parks. Rooms at the front of the hotel could be noisy at night (noted by the fact that the hotel offers free ear plugs by the side of each bed), we were lucky and had a rear facing room. 
2; Stayed here over Christmas, cant fault it really. Rooms are basic, but location is great. Staff were friendly. Not cheap but it's central London and if you want quiet and a bit upmarket then this hotel is not for you. 
2; Haven't been to Travelodge for years (last time stayed in another Lodge the place was dirty, food was bad the whole experience was dire!) but recently stayed at Travelodge Covent Garden and you have to say they've up'd their game, very clean, good breakfast's, great bar prices, overall we were impressed if other lodges around the country are like this we'll definitely try another. 
2;" Stayed here for the location, as we are going to see a show next door at the Brighton Centre. Booked a deluxe feature suite that had a bath in the bedroom with views over the sea. Room rate included breakfast. Nice room with high ceilings, modern, 4 poster bed, plush sofa and flat screen TV. Car parking from the hotel overnight was a little high I thought at £30, but hey, This is the &quot;Grand&quot; hotel! Had a couple of coffees on arrival and two club sandwiches in the bar / terrace area, not too expensive. but enough to make you look at the bill twice! Breakfast next day was good with plenty of choice in the included price, full english buffet, continental selection, various different breads and rolls and enough soft fruit for anyone. We had booked the shellfish restaurant for Sunday lunch prior to us coming back to London, the menu looked fab for those that like Shellfish, only to be told that they do a traditional Sunday roast on a Sunday and not shellfish, although there might be something on the catch of the day, Cancelled the table and went across the road to Riddle and Finns, will review that later.....But that was terrific!! Overall, a nice stay in an old hotel 150years I think, has lots of history and a few nice touches, The family that own it should really be spending a few pounds on the upkeep of the hotel, the exterior, yes i know its opposite the sea, but should have some TLC to repaint the front, ironworks etc to bring this back to its former glory.  Would I stay there again, Yes i probably would, and my wife said the massage she had in the Spa was one of the best massages that she had ever had!! "
2;" We wanted just a nice place for a single night while we were visiting a couple of attractions around Norwich. While researching hotels and offers, Dunston Hall became obvious as a possible and I finally managed to find an even better deal from the De Vere Hotel website itself so proving it's always worth shopping around!. I was a bit nervous due to some of the negative reviews but on balance decided that the majority had found the hotel very good and so proceeded with the booking. The reality was better than I had hoped. It is in a lovely location to the south of the city and despite the obviously busy golf course the ambiance was overall relaxed and quiet which is what we wanted. Upon arrival we were immediately upgraded by the friendly and attentive reception staff and so this made us feel very welcome. We asked for a &quot;quiet and clean&quot; room and we were not disappointed. The room (450 - Deluxe Plus) was spacious, spotlessly clean and was located at the end of one of the buildings overlooking the front area of the Hotel and this was a nicely quiet location.  The Hotel Spa and Gym appeared overall well equipped and looked after and also well used by non-residents but when we used the pool (early evening) it was not busy at all and so we felt very relaxed. The pool was a good size compared to other Hotels and so you were able to get a good swim. The restaurant (Brassiere) was very pleasant and offered a wide choice of menu types including a carvery. My wife was also very pleased with the range of gluten-free options available. The room deal included dinner and a bottle of wine (not a bad bottle either) and although the food choices wouldn't be considered &quot;fine dining&quot; by some it was overall, a more than pleasant experience. Breakfast was a normal buffet type but the service was attentive and quick without feeling rushed. One other thing that we noticed particularly was the friendliness of all the house staff that we bumped into - unusual but very welcoming for a hotel of this size. Would we go back again or recommend it to others? - absolutely! "
2;Dunston Hall is good weekend break for the average golfer, The hotel also caters for weddings and all sorts of events. The rooms are clean and spacious, the beds are very comfortable and I've always had a good nights sleep. The golf course is ok The grounds are well kept The 19th hole is a good bar after a round of golf The food is good at a fair price The facilities are good, swimming pool etc I'm not sure if I would go there for a romantic weekend as a couple as the golfers and weddings tend to be the focus  Overall it's a good value hotel near Norwich
2; Having stayed at the Imperial Hotel in October 2014 and being fairly disappointed. We visited again 24/25th April 2015. Everything absolutely superb. Yes it is tired in some areas, but staff excellent, the place was very clean. Paul the duty manager a credit to the company. Go on give it a try!!!!!! 
2; Unlike our stay at Radisson Blu Glasgow last year, this Birmingham hotel did not provide slippers & a robe. The communal areas have become tired since our last stay four years ago and the bar especially is now in need of a facelift for a hotel of this quality. The staff are however still very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Choose a room on the higher floors if you want to escape the noise from outside as its location is in the heart of the city's China town restaurant and clubs district with lots of all night long street noise and emergency services sirens attending incidents! We were on the 15th floor at the front and were not imune from this! The room keys kept losing their coding requiring re-programming several times over our 4 night stay. 
2; Went to this hotel easter Saturday for 2nights good easy reception nice clean rooms fantastic location and the bars and restaurants in the square were all really good and reasonably price.it was only 2 minutes from the railway station and the city centre I would recommend this hotel to anyone and when I go back to leeds I will be staying there again.one last thing sky lounge worth going to see but only the once bar staff miserable and prices dear but worth one visit great view 
2; My wife and I stayed for a weekend visit to Buckingham Palace. On arrival the look from the outside made me think we had got it wrong. However ince inside all was nice clean and efficient. We had a Club Room with seperate breakfast room . Very comfortable and clean. 
2; Great place to stay. Good location if you are traveling by car. The 'double double' room is perfect for families with young kids. Very nice breakfast with lots of choice and a pool too. Poor wifi reception in bedrooms. Helpful and friendly staff. 
2; I recently stayed for the first time at the marriott hotel at york.The rooms was great clean well equipped and spacious no worries there. The staff were great very polite and professional but what let it down was the food.The presentation was not that good and the prices did not reflect the food standard for a higher class hotel. I could have got a better steak in my local at half of the price?  I don't moan about paying for good food I am chef by trade but I expect a certain standard when i order it the chips was even frozen not fresh.  Besides the above everything else was ok i did do a search for the best room and went ontrivargo instead of booking .com as that was more expensive. 
2; Lovely old hotel looks to have been recently renovated. Our room was on the top floor, whilst quite small it was very clean and tidy, bathroom looked new and trendy. The breakfast was excellent, we had a few drinks in the bar, the atmosphere was good and the food looked great (although we didn't eat there, more a case of too many other things to do / places to see). Car park to the rear benefits from a second level and there was a place when we needed one. 
2; This is a good traditional hotel. It is an old building which has retained a lot of its charm and has been well-maintained to offer a nice change from standard, formulaic hotels where everything is the same. Staff and service was friendly and efficient and the room that we were given was lovely, spacious, quiet, clean and comfortable. As well as being a nice hotel, it is very well situated and is near good shopping and a range of nice restaurants. 
2; I arrived at the hotel earlier than the advised check in time, with a meeting planned nearby. I was checked in without fuss and able to work in my room before heading off to my afternoon meeting. Thus avoiding killing time in coffee shops, and benefitting from free wifi in the room.   The room was compact, as with most Central london hotels, but the TV was large, and there was no noise from the road on my side of the hotel. The hotel is a short walk from Euston and St Pancras so it made an ideal base for my work in London.  On the day that I booked, the rate was better than many of the local chain alternatives, so I felt this offered good value for money at a time when London hotels appear to be getting more expensive - hopefully this won't continue after the Olympics. 
2; Stayed just one night to get an early start in Harrogate. A porter came out to take our bags and the reception process was friendly and efficient. The room was clean and nicely equipped. Room rate for B&B was excellent, but tied to buying dinner in the hotel's restaurant. Dinner was good, but not outstanding, and was a bit on the expensive side. Decor in the restaurant was basic and detracted from the plush presentation of much of the hotel. Cooked breakfast was of excellent quality but modestly proportioned. Staff were very friendly and helpful. 
2; Had a 2 night short break. Enjoyed it but we were especially lucky because the weather was great. On-site facilities preety good if the weather gets bad, meals ok, not great but acceptable. Evening entertainment was ok, have seen better but the site team are very enthusiastic. Bathrooms could do with a refurb. This is apparently the oldest Warners and there were signs it was showing its age. I think Warners is relatively expensive compared to other similar holidays. 
2; The hotel is just off Picadilly Road so is very convenient. 35 minute walk from Paddington and only 15 minute walk to Theatre land. The bar is nice and cosy. Our room was somewhat tucked away and was smaller than I expected. The wifi was almost non existent. The bed was comfy but I'm pretty sure it wasn't a King.  Breakfast was however superb. Fresh, good choice and veggie sausages without having to ask. The omelette chef did a lovely omelette. 
2; Very good location. The room was big. Check in was 3pm. The swimming pool and spa was very nice and modern as you would expect. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good and had plenty of choice. Happy with our choice of staying at this hotel! 
2; breakfast amazing choices I am a veggy scrambled egg and smoked salmon included so I was happy and my friends about that had a swim Jacuzzi found a great deal on line booked on line this is a old historic hotel and has lots of character 
2; My family and stayed at Drayton Manor Hotel on the 27th October 2011, my wife and myself and our three children aged 11,10 & 5 . The package included one nights stay in linked family rooms,breakfast and tickets to Drayton Manor theme park cost was around £160 . The room was very clean and was to a high standard, and had everything we needed. The linked rooms are very good and ideal for families,if needed you could sleep seven people. In the evening we ate in cavery, the food wasn't brillant for what it cost, most things weren't that warm and they only had cheaper meats(gamon and Turkey). The service was very good and the staff were very helpful . After our meal we went back to the room and got ready for bed. Beds were comfortable and we all had a good sleep . In the morning we went for Breakfast,there was plenty of choice full english,various cereals and fruits etc . Food unfortunaley is not yet their strong point ,we all had a full english breakfast and it was all a bit dry and fried eggs were rock hard and then the fire alarm went of half way through breakfast! Once again though staff were very helpful and dealt with things well . The Hotel and it's staff are good but the food just lets it down a bit. We checked out and had great day at the theme park and will certainly return again. 
2;The Mollington Banastre is very conveniently located a couple of miles or so from the center of Chester and it gives an excellent first impression on arrival. On entering the reception area it was found to be clean and tidy we were greeted by the receptionist who was very pleasant and efficient and our room was available ahead of time as we were early. Our first impression of the bedroom was that it was clean and tidy and a quick look in the bathroom all seemed ok the sink and toilet were very clean but on reflection it was found that the shower head was filthy the curtain rail over the bath was mottled with mildew there was some black on the bath panel and some of the paper was lifting on the the whole the cleaners to a good job.We had breakfast during our stay and it was the highlight of our day there was a great selection to help yourself from which was was followed by an excellent cooked breakfast of your choice the waiters are very polite helpful and efficient (as are all members of staff) with whom we came into contact with.
2; I've not stayed in a room here, as I only live up the road, so I can only review the food and drink. I have been here on many occasions, mostly on a Thursday, when they have £5 mojito night and live music from a guitarist. I'm not a big fan of an orginal mojito but they offer a choice of about 10 different ones! I haven't had a full meal here but I have been with a big group of friends and had lots of bits to share and it was ok. This place gets packed on a Friday and Saturday night, when they have a DJ, so don't head here on those nights if you want a quiet one. There are often lots of big birthday or hen/stag night crowds, so it can get very noisy. I do often feel that Bosco are trying to be more upmarket than they are, by charging quite high prices and telling my boyfriend he couldn't wear his hat in there. I went to have breakfast here once and they had run out of the vegetarian sausages, so I would rather go next door to Weatherspoons for brekki at a third of the price. Even so, this place does my absolute favourite cocktail, the Pornstar Martini and at £8.50 a pop, it's not too badly priced, considering you could pay above £12 in other places. 
2; We recently stayed at the Cheltenham Park hotel for the weekend. Our room was large and overlooked the golf course. We found all the staff helpful and very pleasant. We enjoyed our evening dinner, the breakfast which is self service was really good and plentiful. We also indulged in their afternoon tea, which again was really good. There is plenty of free parking. We stayed there having been bought an Amazon deal which was good value. Wether we would stay there at the full price I don't know. 
2;" We have just returned from a 3 day short break at the Holland House and we were very impressed. The location is central but quiet and we were able to access most activities on foot. The hotel has a restaurant but we ate out each evening and there are many good quality, reasonably priced restaurants within walking distance. Breakfast at the hotel was excellent; extensive choice, high quality and superb service. Our son is a wheelchair user and the hotel has been adapted to provide good access to the facilities. We were given a spacious room that was ideal for his needs. The most impressive feature of the hotel for us was the friendly, responsive service we received from all the staff. We would definitely stay here again. "
2; We ended up at the Copthorne following a 36-hours delay on our flight from Gatwick. Going home was not an option so we decided to go there. I wasn't convinced this was going to be a great start for a vacation but it finally turned out to be OK.  The rooms were a bit old fashioned but the beds were large and comfy. I enjoyed the small restaurant near the bar and the kids played in the gardens. We also went to the sports center where a small swimming pool is available for the customers of the hotel. The staff was very helpful and kind with us (knowing in which situation we were). I woke up at night because the hotel is quite large and hosts large groups. One of them clearly had some drunk individuals amont it and the shouted in the corridors at night. This can occur anywhere I guess and I'm not sure the hotel staff has done anything to calm the drunk guys. Finally, our vacation started at Copthorne but I'd honestly prefer not to have to go back. 
2;Stopped for 1 night at weekend, room ok and comfortable (although could benefit from some maintenance) for what we needed at a reasonable price with breakfast included, Staff all very polite and attentive. Hot buffet breakfast was good and tables were kept clean by busy staff. Gave us a voucher for nearest car park so Sat/Sun for £11.20 was ok and loyalty card discounted 10%for the bar.
2; Got a good deal for one night room only, we were not expecting much for £50 but were pleasantly suprised. The staff were very good, the room was spacious and clean. The only downside was the decor is a bit out of date, but to be fair we have stopped in more modern hotels that were not as good as the Vermont. Location is excellent within easy walking distance of all the city centre attractions and dispite having an on site late night bar/nightclub the room was very quite. Will definatly return. 
2; My wife and i used Bewleys to stop over nite,on our way to tenerife.We checked in and parked up no problem. We had already booked our three course meal on the net,the meal was excellent,then we had drink in the bar after,expencive. The next morning we set off the pick up by the mini bus no problem going and coming back. Overall a good stay. 
2;" Had a lovely two nights stay, great location,OK a bit of a walk in to town if you want to catch a train to the city but if you are mobile it's no big deal, the staff are very,very nice and very obliging, we had breakfast and dinner included in our stay and I must say the choice was excellent,my wife had the salmon both nights which she said was very tasty.our only &quot;gripe&quot; was the glass sided toilet/shower,really,it may be a modern way to garner more space for the living area but it is soooooooo embarrassing,not to put too finer point on it, we were not happy with that arrangement.anyhow we would return as the staff made us feel really welcome. "
2; Stopped here over night, This Hotel in its day must have been quite something with its stained glass, and fancy plastered ceilings, Hotel rooms clean and well furnished, comfortable bed. Staff were very helpful.  Not a destination Hotel but great for a short stop over in Sheffield to see family, would use again. 
2; This was the second time we have stayed here, check-in was friendly efficient both times. Modern and unusual decor in the room, but nicely done. The hotel is on a hill so for those with difficulty walking the walk from the car park could have been an issue, but this meant the view from our room at the front was impressive and scenic. We met friends there for a comedy night and had a meal as part of this, which was good for a function. Good service and not too crammed in to the function room. Breakfast was excellent nd again, service was good. Our friends used the pool and said it was good, but you do have to go out to a separate building which may be less pleasant in bad weather. A couple of minor points:  - the cookie you re given on check-in may be welcome but I'd rather have this put in the room rather than making you take it up with your luggage.   - the room numbers don't match the floor you are on so finding your room after a few drinks can be challenging! 
2; Stayed for one night to attend a concert at the nearby Roundhouse. The hotel location is ideal for Camden Town visitors, and an easy taxi ride from King's Cross. It was also very comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful. Highly recommend to others. 
2; Stopped here for work. Food was excellent, both dinner and breakfast. Room was lovely very clean and modern bathroom. Plenty of car parking space, the only issue was the wooden blinds in the room didn't block out the bright outside lights. Would certainly stay again though. 
2; We stayed at the Barcelo Blackpool for 3 nights. We used Tesco Clubcard vouchers and were placed in room 209. We weren't expecting a sea view but upon checking in, we were told our room had a 'partial sea view'. The actual sea view was very 'partial' as you could only see the beach from part of the large bay window.   The hotel is well located along the Blackpool Seafront in a nice, quiet location away from the hustle and bustle of the centre, but is still near enough that you can walk to the Blackpool Tower attractions and the Central and North Piers. We took the number 1 bus that stops in front of the hotel when travelling to Blackpool Pleasure Beach as it is a fair way along the front, and would be a very long walk.   The room was clean and the daily maid service always did a good job and we were pleased to see the stock of biscuits was replenished daily! We did encounter a few minor problems with the smell of the room as there was a sewage smell leaking out of the bathroom. We informed reception and during the day they sent maintenance up to fix the problem, and when we got back the smell was far less noticeable. The other thing we noticed was that the windows were very dirty and old, but we were informed that the windows were being replaced as part of the refurbishment program which is due for completion over the next few years. We were told that also the soft goods and furnishings were being replaced, but we were unsure whether our room had been refurbished as we didn't see any other rooms.   The actual hotel had a real air of grandeur to it, with high ceilings and columns throughout and the live music played most nights was brilliant. The health club was well kept and cared for and was clean every time we used it, and it was nice to have the swimming pool available.   If you are eating at the hotel, eat in the main restaurant as the bar menu and room service prices were extortionate even for a hotel, charging almost £10 for a jacket potato with one topping or almost £4 for a plate of chips. You could far better food in the actual restaurant for less - the bill only came to around £35 for our restaurant meal for 4, whereas we worked out it would be about £65 if we ate in the bar.   Overall a nice hotel, well located, and it will be even better when refurbishment is complete. 
2; My wife and I stayed here, as it was extremely close to the centre of Brindley Place. We arrived early evening and left after breakfast. There were lots of stag and hen crowds staying there, but they were pretty quiet on our floor. The breakfasts have been slated in some of the reviews, but we found it was fine. I have had breakfast buffets all over the world and this was not bad. The egg lady needs to learn to say a word or two and smile, but the waitresses were very kind and helpful and the spread was fine. One word of warning. Another guest told us that the stag crowd came in during the early hours and kicked all of the doors on the floor. Clearly that is not the hotel's fault and it must be one of the risks of staying in a city centre hotel on a saturday night. The hotel was fairly priced. Our friends stayed at the Hampton nearby and they had breakfast included. I got the impression that they paid less overall, as our breakfast was extra. 
2;Large and well-appointed bedrooms. Good restaurant - catered well for our group of over a dozen in a private dining room. Friendly and efficient service. Well-equipped spa. Beautiful location - although unfortunately the weather wasn't great when we stayed so we couldn't explore the surroundings.
2; A group of eight lady golfers stayed at this hotel for two nights this past weekend and all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I found the girls on reception to be extremely helpful. The rooms although, in a little need of a revamp were very comfortable and the corridor we were staying in was quiet. Considering there was a wedding reception on, on the Saturday night, I was pleasantly surprized to not be inconvenienced in the slightest. The evening dinner was excellent and the staff most attentive. Service was prompt and priced well. There was attention to detail on the presentation of the food. Breakfast was basic, the usual cereals and serve yourself cooked breakfast.The danish pastries were a little sad however! However, we were well fortified for the golf that was to follow. The golf course was not really walkable (it took about 10 mins of fast walking) and all of the party, bar me, did drive the short distance to the golf club. However, the club did secure our trolleys and clubs overnight. The course was fantastic and enjoyed by us all. Two of the party partook in the treatments and personally I had a very good sports massage from Harriet which definately helped relieve the stresses of teaching teenagers! I will definitely return to this hotel, hopefully dragging along my husband who ,I know, will enjoy the golf and the good selection of food and wine! 
2; Stayed here as part of a work conference and from the outside this looks like an interesting if not exceptional country house/castle hotel with fairly tidy grounds and an impressive moat leading to the rather grand entrance way.   The reception area is a strange mix of modern hotel with a rather heavy tudor overlay. Kind of works but its not going to be to everyones taste.  Reception was speedy enough - good service.  Room was very cool - tower room with views over the moat and a 4 poster bed etc. Lots of drapes and what not - but enough modern touches to make you feel comfortable. I slept like a king!  Breakfast was an above average buffet type - good choice and served in a nice light space.  Overall I liked this place - its different and doesn't take itself too seriously - but it may be a bit too much and I am not sure I would want to spend more than a night or two!  Wi-fi was a bit ropey too! 
2; My wife and I stayed at Leeming House hotel from 23 October for 4 nights. Room was comfy and we had a good view. Bathroom was clean although tiling needed some attention around bath as grouting was falling out in places and mould was evident in some places. We advised the hotel of this on our departure. We ate in the restaurent on our first night and the meal was excellent. The overall service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and polite. Our only criticism would be the hotel was very hot and stuffy and the comfort dining menu was a bit expensive.  Our overall experience was good and I would recommend Leeming house as a good getaway break hotel.  Mr C P Hill 
2; May the 9th to the 14th 2012, five nights for the price of four DBB package. Many years of staying at this hotel qualifys us to give a real review of the hotel. Some major changes since our last stay in Aug 2011 with a new and larger restaurant, new manager and many improvements over previous years.  We are very hard to please and as you can see we have been criticle in the past but I have to say this year I could only find things to be positive about. The great welcome from John is still there and now all the staff are pleasant and give really good service. I am pleased to see the hotel has recognised how well Toni ran the restaurant when she was on duty in the past and now seems to have total control of the new restaurant where the service was always good and all staff were pleasant. Personally though I preferred the character of the old restaurant but understand why the changes and it is a nice restaurant if a little noisy with so many people at once, maybe needs some acoustic softeners.  The food in the restaurant is much improved over previous visits, not sure what has changed in the kitchen but something has for the better. I would go as far as saying I now think it competes with the best restaurants in the town which it definitely did not previously.  I have to say I fall into the category of over 55 but like to think my mind and expectations are of a much younger person. Unlike a previous writer I didn't notice any rudeness from much older clients than ourselves and though there did seem a leaning towards older clients in the week, the weekend saw an influx of younger guests resulting in a good mix. Another of the changes seems to be that the management seem to recognise the importance of their regular returning guests and for this reason didn't have any live music at the weekends Dart Music Festival which I was surprised to see and a little disappointed as a live pianist or small jazz band would have been great but I do also see the other side of keeping the hotel quiet and a calming place away from the bustle. Very surprised though as they were a major sponsor.  Looking very hard for negative points there were a couple Of very picky points I can mention but probably shouldnt. One being there was a supplement of £1.50 a portion for vegetables or chips with dinner which I find a little strange when some of the meals on the DBB inclusive rate need vegetables. The other point is breakfast is excellent quality but as I don't like a full english but just mushrooms eggs and bacon I find it a little strange that I then only get one mushroom one egg and one rasher of bacon. The first morning I had three rashers of bacon and three mushrooms but only one of each all other days. I did work it out that Toni only served me one morning and guess that she could see I would prefer more! I really don't like asking for more but would prefer to be asked how many I wanted. A small point and the smaller breakfast is much better for my waistline.  All in all a great five nights and we are looking forward to returning in August.  PS  I was a little disappointed to read an earlier review from someone who didn't spend any money in the restaurant or bar but was given an upgrade in room something I have never been offered and we have been returning every year for twenty pluss year! 
2;We stayed in the hotel both before and after a recent overseas holiday. All the staff were really friendly and helpful at the reception, in the bar area and in the restaurant. The rooms were comfortable and the overall ambience in the hotel was convivial.   With it being the main summer school holidays, the hotel seemed to be close to or at full capacity and catered for family groups, couples, business people and also a number of airline staff. The hotel also has day conferences and it looked like a number of people arrived to attend these. Although these various travellers may have slightly different requirements, for the most part everything seemed to go reasonably smoothly - even the hotel evacuation went smoothly and efficiently when the fire alarm went off at breakfast time!   There are free courtesy buses to and from the Manchester airport terminals and the nearby railway station. In the foyer free Internet access is available on computers and for those with their own iPhones there is free Wifi, at least at the time of writing. I would definitely use this hotel again and recommend it to anyone else.   Stayed July and August 2016.
2; A quick one night stay at this hotel has made me want to go back and try it for longer than one night . We stayed in one of the Club rooms which was a good size and up on the 7th floor which was nice and quiet .Breakfast in the morning was good with a good selection of food to choose from...Every member of staff had a smile on their face and were happy to answer questions and help. Look forward to returning before xmas..... 
2;We stopped off for 1 night travelling from scotland to the south coast. Simply our best ever stop over. My wife, 6yr old daughter and I felt it was excellent. Super room, great pool, lovely bar and food. Staff were professional and very friendly. Colourings, pencils and wifi kept all more than content after the pool. Very convenient, plenty space all round from parking to rooms. Super communication by e-mail made us feel valued and welcomed. We wil definitely return, and look forward to it. Oh excellent on line price too. Well done park royal
2; Have stayed ten nights over the last two months and found this hotel to be good value for money with quiet, comfortable rooms. Breakfast is OK and staff generally friendly and helpful. Shall stay again. 
2; Stayed here before, standard travelodge fayre. go high and towards the rear if you dont want traffic noise like a launch at kennedy space centre.  pity prices are now the same as some nearby 4 star hotels. clean basic but lacks any heart or character. good place as utilitatian place to stop in west end 
2; Perfect reception service and the rooms are excellent. Quite a weird route to our room, and then we realised it was a few steps from the front door!  The reception staff could not have been better.  But it is completely overpriced. I would go for a bit more than £100.  Dinner/supper was part of our package for two (at £275!) and I have not had a more disappointing meal for a long time. Mostly inedible. I was in a party of 4 and so did not want to complain. Don't eat there: several other options on the High Street. 
2; The Grand Hotel is a little less grand than it once was, with some areas needing a lick of paint, and the food being nothing special, if perfectly OK. However, for the prices they offer, the hotel is a bargain - £35 for a nice single room, in a 4 star hotel, with full pool, gym & spa facilities, free wifi in all rooms, satellite TV etc and very friendly service. It's also ideally located on the seafront, right next to Torquay railway station. A very good choice for a business trip (and rather popular with the golden oldies too if the clientele at breakfast was anything to go by). 
2; We had one night prior to an early flight. The hotel is situated just off a major road and about 10 minutes from the M23. Check in was simple and the rooms we had were on the third floor. The rooms are fairly spacious with a decent and well stocked bathroom. The ground floor bar served light meals and was adjacent to the restaurant which served larger meals. (Ours was fine in the bar.) A bottle of wine was £21.95. There is a pool and fitness room but we didn't use them. We had an early flight and check out was a breeze. We then had to drive to the airport car park (part of the deal) which was about ten minutes away. The hotel provided a map and it was a simple trip. I would use this hotel again for LGW. 
2; We stayed one night as part of a theatre weekend, having stayed before.  The room was very clean and of a good size, the breakfast was excellent.  The hotel location is very good for the theatres and Oxford Steeet. 
2; It does what it says on the tin. Nice place, friendly staff, decent leisure facilities (especially if you like golf), good pool for the kids, decent restaurant. We had a suite which was roomy enough without being spacious. Value wise its OK (probably about right for what you get). Nothing there blows you away but it ticks all the boxes and I would stay there again. 
2; This is my second visit to the Radisson Blu prior to early flights the following morning and this hotel has, on both occasions, been good. Checking in and car parking are also easy with helpful reception staff. The rooms have been clean and in good condition with comfortable beds and checking out was without problems. On return to collect my car the reception dealt with it quickly so I was not waiting prior to the journey home. If the M25 ran as smoothly as this hotel that would be a terrific bonus!! 
2;"We enjoyed our stay at the Brudenell and would return. It is pricey. The levels of service and cleanliness were high. The food was good; the cooked breakfast was of particularly high quality. We had an inland-facing second floor room. This was well equipped. The view over the Alde estuary is nevertheless most attractive. We anticipated from other reviews that the room (212) would be smaller than those with a sea view, which were not available when we booked. The ensuite bathroom was nevertheless unusually large, albeit only accessible from the bedroom via steps. There was just enough space in the bedroom and the bed itself was very comfortable. The room was hot, even though the outside temperature was not particularly exceptional - we were however discouraged from keeping the windows open because of the risk of an invasion of marsh flies. The fan provided enabled us to have a comfortable night. The corridor leading to the bedroom was however quite stifling."
2; We stayed two nights here and it was lovely. All the staff were really friendly and professional. Everything was very clean. Rooms were ok. Plenty of room to swing a car if we'd had one. Loved the breakfast. Just two things ... For breakfast use butter and in the bar Jusy offer some nuts/ crisps with cocktails and drinks. Lived the art deco type interior. Also appreciated the 10% off several local restaurants. the Italianon Catherine Place was lovely. I'd come here again. 
2; Having stayed at this hotel I have to recommend it as virtually every aspect is ideal. First the location is perfect being right on the seafront. The rooms are comfortable and clean and you get what you pay for. The restaurant is good with plenty of choices on the menu. The only let down is the parking, being Brighton parking comes at a price and this is a surcharge. Overall I rate this hotel highly but the regular room prices can be high so look out for deals as they come around quite frequently. 
2;The hotel was good but not one of the better one the room was good clean eat in the Bijou Bar the choice was not great choice to pick from had the sea bass very nice did not have to wait long for the meal I would try another next time
2; Great welcome, only pub in town so gets busy at times... lovely breakfast and rooms... parking does get full so be prepared... nice walks nearby...  Sometimes the bar staff had to run off and check people in which meant waiting a long time for a drink... but generally it was fine.   Wi-Fi slow, but you need it, phone signal poor 
2; What a great hotel. Staff were brilliant, very friendly and helpful. The treatments were lovely, and everything is clean and very well maintained. Rooms are modern and comfortable, much better than many hotels in the same class. The evening meal was fantastic, and really good buffet breakfast with loads of choice. The only things that could be improved is hotter water in the shower/bath, as its lukewarm and meant you cant have a decent soak. Also, would be nice to have a hot tub or jacuzzi.  However, that doesnt really detract from a lovely, modern hotel. Highly recommended, and we will be returning! 
2; Due to the bad weather we arrived at the hotel at 11p.m. and was able to get the car parked immediately. We were checked in promptly and there was no problem getting something to eat and drink.  The Angels Wine Tower had to be seen to be believed. They must be the first acrobats I had seen behind a bar!  The bedroom was modern an well appointed.  The hotel is only a five minute walk from the terminal and I would recommend the Stop& Go package. 
2;"I really wanted this to be a 5* review; as the staff are friendly and accommodating and the hotel is situated in an amazing location, and is really competitively priced. Add on to that the incredibly convenient parking, the generally delicious food (tiger prawn linguine w/ pinot grigio was amazing!) and the unique character of the hotel, and you can hopefully see why I was so keen for this to be a perfect review!  Sadly a couple of things prevent this from being a 5* review - first of all the steak on the 1st night I asked for Medium Rare, and it was definitely Rare (in fairness it was still tasty - and I'd rather it was less cooked than more so!). The room service menu has a mention of 24 hour service being available, but nowhere does it say what time this service kicks in so you end up ringing room service with trepidation that the non-24 hour options may not be available!  The main disappointment of the stay was checkout though - leaving at 8:30am is a pretty standard time to check out for people on business I would say. And upon coming down it was clear this was accurate - as there were around 10-15 of us queuing up, with 2 staff on reception, one of whom was dealing with an issue with the car-park for another gentleman (they are very helpful there!). As such it was 8:50am by the time I had checked out, and was thus already 5 minutes late by the time I left the hotel - this put a bit of a pall over an otherwise very enjoyable stay.  So in conclusion, come down about 15 minutes earlier than normal for checkout and you should have a good stay!"
2; This hotel is fine for the long weekender. In the heart of Romsey, this is an ideal location to explore the New Forest and surrounding attractions. Parking is situated within the public pay and display to the rear of the hotel, with charges Monday through Saturday 8.30am to 4.00pm. Tip: Remember to rise early to feed the meter. If booking for a weekend, look into their offers, ours included Friday evening 3 course meals, and breakfast Saturday. This was definitely value for money as the restaurant is very expensive, prices such as £23.00 for a steak without trimmings, and £7.50 for a continental breakfast. Tip: Check that any offer booked is registered with the reception and in particular the restaurant staff, as they may unaware and charge full room prices or for meals. The rooms were generally comfortable, although on both the Friday and Saturday evenings the rear Coach House was hired out to private functions, thus until around midnight quite noisy, though not unpleasant. Tip: Rooms to the front may overlook the main road. Bed was comfortable, and the bathroom clean. Full tea / coffee makings (small long life milk cartons) were present within the room. No room safe installed. A daily newspaper is provided outside the room. The staff were generally polite. The town itself has local produce shops, main high street banks, and thankfully no Tesco, Sainsburys etc. 
2; I stayed 4 nights at the Novotel while attending a conference in the nearby Manchester Central Exhibition Centre, just a 5 minute walk away. My check-in was delayed until 2pm - the constant bane of the business traveller. But this is well advertised so I cannot fault the hotel for that.   The whole experience was excellent at Novotel - the only small gripe is the rather dull room. You could really be any hotel in any city in the UK when you close the door. But it was spacious and clean and quiet. The bathroom is a little out of proportion to the room in its minuscule size and for some reason the toilet is separate. I like to conduct all my business in one room if you know what I mean.   The breakfast selection is vast and all the items on the buffet were regularly topped up - so freshly cooked and prepared. They even have a little TV supper table where you can put on a pair of headphones and enjoy the personal screen to catch up on the days news or World Cup action.   I have to say the bar was a little lifeless for a city centre hotel. But the hotels central location means that most people were probably nipping out to one of the nearby hostelries for their evening imbibing.   Overall a very pleasant stay and I would return again. Certainly it's location smack in the city centre is great if you don't want to catch a taxi every time you want to eat or enjoy a drink. 
2; Nice room, good hotel and bar area. Spa was closing following day for refurbishment but the facilities seemed fine. Robes provided but no slippers so had to change in spa. No problem. Breakfast was average but staff and service good. 
2; We decided to top off a good year for us both with the New Year Weekend package at The Lygon Arms. I used the hotel regularly 20 years ago so was interested to see if Barcelo had made a difference. Firstly, it was just as I remembered, but better. The package was good value and we made a number of new friends. From a hospitality perspective I was very pleased with the quality of their offer, as they have managed to retain much of the Lygon Arms atmosphere, whilst adding those facilities we have come to expect in quality hotels e.g. The Spa. Second big thing for me was the quality of the staff in all departments. From senior management to housekeeping, they made us feel welcome and contributed to our enjoyment. The food is excellent and the wine list comprehensive and eclectic. Only negative is that the main car park is going to need some resurfacing soon. Compliments to Jane and her team. 
2; My girlfriend and I stayed for a couple of nights to provide ourselves with a break from renovating our new home. It was just what we needed, relaxing atmosphere and generally high standards throughout. We ate at the restaurant both nights and were particularly impressed with the food, in all honesty if I lived closer I would make an effort to visit the restaurant again- this is more than can be said for most hotel dining experiences. This hotels location will surely make it popular with corporate guests who are looking for a nicer environment than your usual premier inn/travelodge fodder, I frequently stay in hotels for business reasons and get very frustrated with the quality. Beales is one of the hotels that has got it right, it is also a small independent chain which is always nice to support. 
2; Stayed for one night on a last minute deal. Staff were very helpful and pleasant, particularly Jet on reception. Valet parking is available at £16 which is great price seeing as the car park close by is that price and not valet of course.... On arrival we were offered an upgrade for a minimal price which we opted for. Great deal, got a suite on the 12th floor, wine in the room, breakfast and robes as extra. This hotel is in a fabulous location, straight across for Harvey Nicks and on Corner of Deansgate.  On our return from a days shopping, chef was at reception offering tasty bites to tempt you to dine there and if we hadn't already booked I think we may have been tempted.  Breakfast was fabulous, very busy but staff cleared tables quickly and virtually no waiting. The rooms were slightly outdated but clean and spacious.  Overall a great hotel and would definitely revisit and recommend 
2; Stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights on business, a nice hotel, good buffet english breakfast. Room was ok. Only complaint was there was no trouser press but an ironing board & iron was supplied.  
2; Very helpful staff. Good food and drinks in the bar. Breakfast was really good as well. Not the cheapest of hotels but we would stay here again next time in York.  Check in and check out was quick and painless. 
2; My fiance had stayed at this hotel last year before a holiday and she was very pleased with her stay. The room and the hotel look as if they have recently had a makeover which is always a bonus.   The good points are, nice room (a little small but ok)  A good bathroom and a nice shower Windows that opened Air con Excellent breakfast  No real bad points other than after swimming in the pool my fiance had a skin reaction, but the pool was very clean and so were the changing rooms.  Laterooms special and saved a lot on the published rates 
2; Just spent two nights in this hotel for our anniversary. Starting from checking in , the lady who checked us in was so polite and friendly made you feel really welcome. The room 418 was spotless. The gesture from all the staff to give us an anniversary card was a really nice touch, thank you. The evening meals where good and and once again all the staff where so polite and seemed very happy doing there job. It was a pleasure to stay at this hotel. We have stayed in many hotels , never experienced such happy friendly staff. Will be staying again. 
2; Very smart hotel that is possibly a bit too glitzy for a place of its history and character, but the room was clean and surprisingly spacious. Free wifi, too. Great location, though parking is a challenge. 
2; My partner and I booked a weekend break via Secret Escapes, which included a two night stay here with a three course dinner, and afternoon tea for the next day. The room was very spacious and well presented, spotlessly clean, with a sea view. The three course meal was delicious - with just the right timing between courses and good balance of friendliness and formality that you'd expect from a renowned hotel. Stunning view from restaurant. The staff went out of their way on the Sunday to get us our afternoon tea after we arrived slightly late from our Dartmouth boat cruise! We didn't use the outdoor pool but tried out the indoor facilities and they were nice and clean, and not very crowded like at some hotels. We are both 25 years old and didn't feel that it was aimed at older customers, but parts of it are old-fashioned. Well worth going if you can get a good value package! 
2; This has become our regular pre-flight stop-over. Slightly pricey but very convenient for the North Terminal. Takes the stress out of travelling to Gatwick on the day of the flight and is especially useful for mid-mornign departures. 
2;..we booked three rooms as attending a business conference in Westminster and the location of the hotel was very convenient. I've actually wanted to stay here for a good while, so was really looking forward to it, but then again, concerned it would not live up to my expectations.  The front of the hotel looks gorgeous, set back into a long courtyard, with nice planting, walkways either side of the access road. On arrival at the reception entrance, the doorman is the first of many staff to warmly welcome you. Entering (via automatic doors - good for luggage bearing), the reception itself is quite lovely expanse of white, with a sweeping staircase, and further staff showing you where to check-in.... Check-in itself was painless, and done with an enormous smile.   My superior room (their entry level) was quite spacious, had a nice wide entrance, and 'hall', leading to a desk/work area, then around to a generous sized bed.   Good wardrobe space (including safe, iron/ironing board etc) alongside a not overly priced mini bar. The desk itself was well equipped (plug sockets for numerous types of plugs - UK, continental etc). The only issue was the lovely comfy desk chair was too low to sit and comfortably type on a laptop.   The bathroom was really nicely appointed... I loved the shower head, and really enjoyed using the shower... my only gripe was the lack of space. No room for my own toiletries. Could do with another small shelf. There was literally no shelf space left...  Didn't make use of any of the hotel's facilities, as didn't have time, nor the need. But will say I immensely enjoyed staying for the one night. I had a great night's sleep.   Would definitely stay there again if I had the chance... I loved the St Ermin's and it did live up to my expectations... well done all...    Free wifi throughout worked well... always a good things.
2;Ground floor bar area has a good atmosphere. The restaurant downstairs has a poor range of food and isn't good value.Bedrooms comfortable and modern.Overall the hotel has a good boutique feel in a great location
2; Nice hotel located ideally for visiting Colchester area and Essex coastline. Staff friendly and helpful. Nice pool with sauna and steam room plus gym - avoid the swimming classes. Breakfasts very good. Room very comfortable. Slight background traffic noise from a12 but hardly noticeable in rooms. 
2;" Stayed here for one night on a Saturday evening for a night away with friends. Check in was quick and friendly, ordered a bottle of champagne to be sent up to the room which wasn't passed on to room service so ended up going down to the bar and getting it myself after 30 mins. Not a huge issue for me but not what you would expect from a luxury hotel. Room was small but relatively clean, the decor is traditional but in good taste. One large white stain on the coverlet on the bed?!  Ordered food up to the room which was very tasty; Caesar salad and a sandwich which was presented well and arrived in good time considering they were very busy. Left our bags with concierge the next day to walk around the markets, again, all staff helpful and friendly. Overall, a positive experience, not sure about value for money at £320 a night but this was expected at such a busy period. We would stay again if needed be and we got a cheaper rate.  "
2;The hotel staff are very nice, and try hard.  The hotel is just another to be honest.  I had been excited at the thought of sitting in a jacuzzi and relaxing only to find what they have is a bubble pool - think of it like this like a jacuzzi but not heated... errrrm no thanks! tried it and lasted only seconds.  Had to make a point that when food says it's available until ten, then ordering at five to ten is okay - the chef obviously wanted to leave and wasn't best pleased!!!  Odd thing here is instead of Jelly beans for diamond members you get chocolate covered nuts and raisins - quite a nice change without compromising on the quality - see also review of Newbury.
2;There's not much to stay about this hotel as it just does the job simply. The beds were nice the shower was good and the area you couldn't fault it. It was right next to a large tesco and obviously very near gatwick airport. The only let down is the ridiculous price for a buffet breakfast which should not of cost over £6 but it is. Also we could hear loud music from a party the hotel was hosting which kept us up a little. However it is good value for money but food prices need to be taken down a little.
2; My wife & I had booked a box at the Albert Hall for a Christmas concert & wanted a hotel near the Hall. We booked for 1 night on line through an agency at a very good price. We received confirmation on line in the name of Quality Crown. As the hotel was very near a tube station & we had just 1 small case we took a train & walked to the address. I had looked at the hotel,address etc. on line so knew where it was, however we could not find it & it was fortunate that a passing traffic warden helped us by explaining that the hotel was now the Mercure. We checked in and very helpful desk staff apologised for the confusion. We had booked a small room which was very clean, comfortable &well equipped. I asked the desk staff how to get to the Albert Hall they were very helpful & explained &also gave us a map.We had a very quiet , comfortable night. The inclusive breakfast was very good both in quality& quantity with pleasant helpful staff.We did not use the lounge etc.but it looked very pleasant & comfortable. All in all we enjoyed a very pleasant stay. 
2; General:  - Grand but dated decor in parts with pleasant lounges and bars. Bar food was good for the price and drinks were typical for hotels - expensive, but not extortionate.  - Rooms are good: clean, great view, reasonably spacious, Cable TV etc. (only down point was our AC didn't work - we reported it).  Pro's: - The hotel is in a lovely spot on the top of the cliff with fantastic views across the bay.  - Its a short (10 mins) walk into the town centre with plenty of facilities close by. - The staff (especially concierge) went out of their way to help us and were great in recommending bars & restaurants in the town and making our bookings. - The Spa is clean and well equipped with great views.  Con's:  - The AC wasn't working in our room. Not a big problem as it wasn't that warm outside but would be v frustrating in summer with large south facing windows (we reported it but didn't push for a room change or discount). - Parking isn't free for guests. - Rooms are pricey (so look out for a deal online) compared with other options in the town. 
2; After investigating other hotels in the area we were pleasantly surprised at the good value this up-market hotel offered. We didn't use the restaurant, having been invited to a friend's house for dinner, but were happy with the friendly service at breakfast. The room was spacious and airy with a window that actually opened properly to let the air in. It was quiet, overlooking woodland to the rear and had a bed that was a decent size. I have to say that the dark colour scheme of the room and bathroom would not be my first choice and this scheme is found in many parts of the hotel, including around the pool. For an hotel that looks so new on the outside we thought the bathroom looked a little tired, not helped by the dingy colour scheme. All in, I think we'd go back again and would recommend the hotel to friends. 
2; I attended a wedding at this venue and stayed for several days. The location is good, the building and grounds are also very pleasant. The facilities for the wedding ceremony and reception were both excellent, well organised and nicely presented.  Having said this, when we first checked in, we received our keys and went to our allotted room. Which was in the old block and clearly was originally servants quarters in the roof. We stayed in it for about 15minutes before returning to reception and wanting a room change. We had to pay for the upgrade and all they had available was the second bridal suite. This was in the new block, and these rooms are spacious, well layed out and pleasant. Although the decor in this room was a little odd, with aged white furniture, I can't complain about the comfort.  The hotel has a nice warm pool, hot tub and other leisure facilities. The bar was comfortable and reasonably priced, given its a hotel bar. Very nicely done, although the layout of the old block could have been better.  I'd happily return here for a couple of days. Having said that, winterbourne is not very local to anywhere, and if your planning on travelling in the area a car would be necessary. Possibly a hotel more suited to hosting events, than using as a base for visiting the area. 
2; Stayed here for one night as part of a big treat and we had an executive room which was lovely! Every detail in the room was great and it was huge with a massive comfy bed! The slight downside to the whole experience was that the check-in process took far too long given we had pre-paid the room and the coffee machine in the executive lounge was not working. Small details but for a landmark London hotel we expected it would have been faultless. 
2; Very nice hotel and friendly staff. Excellent breakfast with speedy service. Cap park needs a good clean though. 
2; Having stayed at the Old Ship Hotel in Brighton on the previous night, our room at the Abode proved to be a welcome change - spacious, modern, quiet and with the facilities you'd expect  Personally, I found the staff slightly over-friendly. The breakfast was less than generous, a toast rack would have been welcome and why it could not be charged to my room is beyond me. However, these are minor criticisms  We'd stay again 
2; Impressive lobby and service. Very professional staff at the entrance and checked into the room very quickly. Room was large, spacious and quiet. Bed comfortable. The only thing is I would hope that a hotel of this quality would provide free wifi! Breakfast came as standard and was excellent. I would recommend the breakfast to anyone! Would stay here again. 
2;"Hotel probably best described as &quot;BIG&quot; & somewhat dated as being from another era which to some may not be entirely welcoming. That said, the short stay was most enjoyable. Hotel ideally situated, just moments from the centre of Harrogate, which afforded easy walks through the entire town. Staff were most courteous & professional, evening meal was very good & the breakfast excellent (huge choices). Room was spacious,clean & well facilitated (sadly no fridge) & quiet. Recreational facilities easily accessed & modern (swimming pool, gym, sauna, steam & jacuzzi). As a base, Harrogate was ideal for excursions to Knaresborough & Ripley. Would recommend for short stays but would seek to stay elsewhere if staying again in Harrogate."
2; We pick this hotel as we wanted somewhere quiet near to Windsor. The hotel is situated in a great setting. We checked in and when for a lovely afternoon tea. Our room was fine for what we paid for (£109 for the night including breakfast) but if we were staying longer then the refurbished room would be better. We had Dinner and Breakfast at the hotel. The standard was ok but the service was very good. In general we thought the hotel was fine for what we paid for and would stay here again. Thank you for a great service on all your staff 
2; I admit, I was slightly skeptical when first viewing the hotel which appeared to be in an industrial estate, however I was wrong. Hotel was stunning inside. Staff were lovely, the facilities and the general looks inside were brilliant. The room itself was also beautifully presented, the beds were super comfy and the bathroom was delightful. The complimentary breakfast also was a nice touch. However the only thing for me which was very much an annoyance and a bit weird, was the bathroom door. This was found by a few people within our booking. No locks, glass frosted sliding door, which if you're trying to be quiet in the morning makes an awful noise. This was found in all the rooms we booked. This kept it from being 5 stars in my opinion, it was that annoying. 
2; We have walked passed the Rookery many times and it was an itch we wanted to scratch - so glad we did.  The staff are wonderfully personable and the hotel is full of great touches. On arrival the whole place smelt of beeswax and the polish of a well kept, old property. Every room is individual and comes with history for the origin of its name. The rooms will fascinate - ours had the most amazing and complex flushing mechanism on the loo! And the floor had a wonderful slant with an antique bed and comfy side chair. We are not normally room dwellers, but it was an enjoyable place to relax and be - so we used it more.In the afternoon there is tea and cake in the living room - scrumptious lemon drizzle and chocolate. There is an honesty bar stocked with really high quality drinks (soft and alcoholic) plus snacks with the same repeated in your rooms mini bar. And you can choose to take breakfast which is served in your room ( we didn't)  So, why not a 'full marks'. Well, our TV was barely tuned in, so we relied on iplayer (free wifi so all not lost). There is no tea and coffee making facility in the room. Yes, you can call the amazing staff, but some times you just want to press your own cafetière And, if you are not like me and will forgive a drizzling shower because of its restoration perfect piece of beautiful plumbing - you will not be over the moon.   Basically the Rookery split the vote - I'd go back in a heart beat, but my partner feels he has itched his scratch and would like to try some where else. 
2; Very good hotel....we enjoyed it. Staff were exceptional at welcome, and the room was good. Excellent breakfast! Easy access to centre of manchester and shops. Will most likely use it again when around. 
2;A lovely suprise visit for me and my partners anniversary. A Sunday evening stay and upgraded to a business type room which was awesome. Great for access to the city and a fabulous view of Birmingham and beyond. This is the third stay in a Radisson and certainly will stay again. Great breakfast, great service and thanks to Monica on reception who greeted us and checked us in. Would highly recommend.
2;"We stayed there Saturday night for a special family party.Booked two rooms,one double for us parents and one twin for our &quot; kids &quot; aged 15 and 23. They had agreed this once to &quot; rough it &quot; and share and save money as there are no single rooms. They had a double bed each and our bed was large and comfortable. All normal hotel facilities in room ,nothing to grumble about. Good choice at breakfast ,cereals ,fruit ,full English etc etc..Pool was nice apparently .My son is a gym God and said the gym wasnt up to his standard but Im sure its ok for less fussy.All the staff seemed to be Indian ,which seemed strange for Swindon."
2; I just wanted to send you a quick note to thank you for all of your help in organising our wedding on Friday, everything ran like clockwork and we had a wonderful day. We had many positive comments from our guests regarding Sopwell House, and we were very impressed with how well everything was run. The whole operations team were fantastic, Marcus and Jaro couldn’t have been more helpful, could you please send our thanks onto them. The spa facilites are also fantastic.    We are already looking forward to our next visit to Sopwell House. 
2;" My assessment of the 'Value' as 'Excellent' is based on the fact that we weren't paying anything like the posted room rate! I don't think there was anything on across the road at the RSC and it was mid week, we only paid £99 per room which is excellent value. This is not a new building and the internal layout is quirky and full of character to say the least. I don't know if there are any rooms that don't involve negotiating stairs so if that is a problem for you I suggest that you ask up front. It's a while since I have been shown to my room in a hotel rather than a B&B, but in this place it is more than just a nice touch; it's essential, you won't find your room on your own unless you have been there before. All the rooms are named after trees, no room numbers. It was a hot day but the very particular mention by the receptionist that I would find &quot;a fan in my cupboard&quot; was unexpected nonetheless. As other reviewers have mentioned the rooms are very well appointed indeed, mine had a sort of dressing room bit as well as a huge bathroom with a separate bath and double size shower cubicle and they have obviously spent a lot of money on the place, so it was rather surprising to find that there was no air con, hence the 'fan in the cupboard'. As it happened the simple expedient of sleeping with the window open was sufficient to control the temperature, but I don't really like doing that during the hayfever season if I can avoid it. I needed to be up fairly early in the morning anyway so the resulting noise from the street wasn't much of an issue. Ample free parking is a definite plus for any hotel in my book and especially in this location as you would struggle to find anywhere sensible to park nearby otherwise. "
2;"Everything about our stay was lovely. The price was great especially as you are just a few feet from Hyde Park.  The hotel is very modern and the rooms are spotlessly clean. The brasserie gladly accepted our Taste Card which saved us 50% on food over the weekend. The only minor annoyance was the difficulty getting the lifts to recognise the room keys. Judging from the number of frustrated people that we found trying to get the lift to move over the weekend I would say that it's a system problem and not &quot;user error&quot;."
2; I stayed overnight for a business trip and had a nice stay. The entire staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. The rooms were spacious and modern although other parts of the hotel were a bit dated.  Overall, a nice place to stay in a relaxing environment. Would definitely return. Great service! 
2; Ideal central ocation for Leeds, just next to the railway statioon overlooking the main square.  This is a large art deco hotel and very much a Leeds landmark. Privately owned, it has great individuality and character. We did not drive tere but there appears to be a concierge service which looks after guests' cars where parking is concenred. Rooms very nice and also in art deco style.   The only negative really was the basement level restaurant. Breakfasts were good but due to lack of atmosphere we did not dine there. 
2;" I needed an overnight in Cheltenham, and found this hotel on a screenscraper. 4* including breakfast for £53 looked too good to be true.  Plentiful free parking led to a swift and easy check in. Room 450 was slightly retro (think late 90s), but huge, immaculate, and in good order. Didn't eat in the hotel (10 minute drive in to town) but had a drink in the bar afterwards. Nice staff, comfortable seating, infuriating (but mercifully quiet) background piano musak. Went to bed early.  Room at a pleasant temperature, dark and quiet. Huge bed, unfortunately with a height difference in the middle, and way more comfortable on one side than the other. Good pillows. Slept well - but not for as long as I'd hoped for.  Unfortunately my room was next to the cleaning supplies, so an unwanted early wake-up came in the form of chatting, laughing, and noise as the cleaners got their carts loaded up and made a start on things. I'd hoped for a lie in, but it was obvious that the previous peace and quiet wasnt coming back - so I made my way to breakfast.  It was a treat to sit by the window watching the goings on on the golf course in the early morning sunshine, while seated comfortably (loads of space around the tables) and eating decent quality hot food.  Mentioned the noise issue to reception on the way out. &quot;That's not good, have a nice day....&quot; I assumed this was a compliant they'd heard before. It's a nice hotel - just watch your room choice if you don't want to be up early! "
2; We were greeted and checked in by some of the friendliest staff that we have met in a London Hotel. When we got to our room we were disappointed in it's position and it's size. As we could only stay one night as opposed to our original planned stay of 2 nights, we decided not to complain. We then received a call from Reception asking how our room was, I did say that we were disappointed with the size of the room but we're only here overnight so it will do. Minutes later another call saying that the Hotel were trying to find us another room as we were not happy. They tried, but unfortunately it was a busy night and there were only a few options, we said that we appreciated them trying but we would stay put for now, we were told that on our next stay we will be automatically upgraded which we appreciated. We ate in the Old Masters, and upon arrival were shown to our table and given a glass of Champagne each as part of their apology, a nice touch. Our Waiter was very attentive and very polite, we had a lovely relaxing evening and although our stay didn't start too well, we appreciated how we were being looked after. Breakfast was very good, a great choice and poached eggs cooked to order in front of you (I love a Poached Egg!). We will return to Rubens at The Palace as it is friendly, well positioned and offers fantastic service. 
2; Visited for a weekend. The hotel is on a great location for both the City and the Tower of London. Rooms are a good size and recently refurbished. Beds comfy, shower good. The room was a little hot despite the air con which also had a loud vibrating noise. The hotel fixed the noise (mostly) when notified, but it didn't make it any more effective. We didn't have breakfast but there are plenty of places nearby. We tried the bar on the 12th floor which has great views. Lifts seemed a bit slow when it was busy. Overall I'd recommend as somewhere to stay. 
2; Stayed for two nights,nice clean hotel good decor,food was nice breakfast very good,really hot water in bathroom be care if children running a bath. Drinks are reasonable price for a hotel, only downside was beds a bit to soft and the zedbeds very very soft, new mattresses please, but would go back 
2;"I haven't stayed in a &quot;chain&quot; hotel in ages, so was fearing the worst from the Northampton Marriott. However, I am glad to say it surpassed all of my expectations. The people who work here clearly care about providing a good service and generally doing a good job. The hotel, whilst not the height of cutting-edge fashion, is really comfortable and most important of all clean - something which should be a given but is often not. My bedroom was not huge but had lots of amenities, such as broadband, iron, fridge, good toiletries, nice quilt on the bed and comfy mattress. Most suprising was the scrupulous cleanliness of all areas and very careful housekeeping. My room was spotless and everything worked! The food was presented with care, room service came on time, even the notorious breakfast buffet was fresh and appealing. The only (very minor) criticisms I can make are that the burger I had for dinner was slightly overcooked and the dubious £2.50 &quot;tray charge&quot; added to already-ambitious room service charges. But these are minor flaws that shouldn't put you off a stay in a fantastically-run, comfortable hotel. "
2; 2nd visit this year (having stayed/reviewed in March. Once again, no issues, excellent check in, points used for an Exec Room, which was spotless, client and with all amenities. Bar lunch was good but a bit pricey for what it is. All staff were friendly and efficient, ample car parking which will be secure in a couple of weeks, very easy to get to. As a base to visit Oxford/friends, I highly recommend it, 
2; Went to see Classical Spectacular at the Royal Albert Hall, so booked The Queens Gate Hotel as we have stayed there before, mainly because of location. This time we had a Club Room, air-con, minibar, inclusive breakfast etc. 1st floor location, adequate for our one night stay.  Bathroom had bath with shower, also seperate shower enclosure, which was hot and powerful, great. Breakfast was buffet service, but only cold plates and warm food, which was a shame as their was plenty to choose from and quite tasty. Toast machine was usual, put on conveyor once - get warm bread, put through twice - get one side burnt. Fresh orange, and coffee machines great. We have always found the staff very friendly and helpful, another reason we go back. 
2;" I spent two consecutive weeks at this hotel while on business in November 2014. My choice of hotel was influenced by my previous experience of the Novotel Hotel, Glasgow, which despite some minor faults, proved to be a good choice. I provided my feedback to the existing Hotel Manager, Mr. Verzi, after my stay, which was more detailed than the summary provided here. Nevertheless, the positives and negatives arising from my occupancy are detailed below.  The positives; a hot buffet breakfast, a steam room and well equipped gym, clean bed linen and close proximity to Leeds City Centre and business districts. The staff were helpful (on reception, at breakfast and dinner) and assistance with minor housekeeping matters (on this occasion, a faulty iron that needed to be replaced and room kettle that required cleaning), were resolved promptly. Incidentally, Javier, the Receptionist, should be complimented for delivering his efforts to provide superior customer service.   The negatives; both rooms during my stay had minor drainage issues in the bathrooms, e.g. the bathroom sink that was slow to clear but was not unduly bothersome. Ironically my room for my second week (610 at the rear of the hotel) proved to be noisier than my previous room (641 which faced a main road) due to the constant hum of machinery, presumably from the adjacent room’s air conditioning or plant machinery. Light sleepers may need to take note. However, despite the minor faults, the Novotel is a good hotel. "
2; We have just returned from a weeks walking on and around the Long Mynd. The hotel has just bee taken over on a five year lease by H F Hoiidays. Some improvements have already been made with others on the way. Our comfortable room was No 24 (Falcon) with views over the swimming pool and the valley beyond. We did have a problem getting hot water (we had to let the tap run for a good few minutes each time). Hopefully this is going to be one of the improvements that H F will make. The food was as always at an H F House excellent and plentyful, the staff friendly and Brithsh. The grounds of the hotel are well worth a stroll with many wood carvings scattered throughout. 
2;Overall we had a very good time, hotel has had a refurbishment of some rooms and the main restruant and still has some teething problems before I could give it a better score, a little of the charm and magic was missing, new is not always a good thing.  The problems that we had were sorted out there and then so did not come away thinking we were not listern to. Food in the new restruant was very good and not over priced. Location is excellent, staff were helpful.  On the Sunday, had we not booked afternoon tea, as a resident there would have been no where to sit, this needs to be addressed!.  Great location in relation to shops, pier, nightlife etc, we organised a private escorted walk with Brighton Walks, Lyn picked us up at the hotel and included the hotels history into our tour it really was something special and well worth doing if you are there in a group.  Would I stay again? yes
2; Stayed here for a weekend in March for our tenth wedding anav. very nice room and resteraunt. Food was excellent and the reception staff made checking in very easy and informal.Lovely breakfast with everything you would want.Yes a bit pricey for our stay over all but well worth it with a good time had by us both 
2; Very nice hotel at a reasonable price. As long as you don't mind the short journey on the DLR (which I enjoyed) the hotel is relatively conveniently located, just a short walk to the hotel from the DLR station. 
2;" We live very local, but decided to get a room to make more of night of it - glad we did.  The venue is really nice, modern and the bars have a great ambience - albeit very expensive as you'd expect from a Hitlon/ Weddding. That said, you don't feel it's over priced.  A small criticism we had was that the room smelt of feet when we arrived... pretty off putting, but we checked in, left the window open and a few hours later it was fine.  The food was great at the wedding and breakfast even more so.  I would recomned, but maybe won;t be return as it's so local - unless another friend chooses to get married there!  The other slight gripe is you cannot book direct with the hotel, you end up speaking with a call centre in the US somewhere - which is dissapointing. "
2; A very smart hotel with comfortable rooms and situated in a great location. Although breakfast was nice we did find the service a little slow.  Our second visit to this hotel and it most certainly won't be our last. 
2; My wife and I have returned from a stay at the above hotel. The beds were comfortable ,the staff where very pleasant and helpful in changing our original room on the second floor to one on the ground floor because we are both not good with stairs as there is no lift . The food was very good and the whole stay was very good value . Very worth a stay if in the area . 
2; Completely in line with the metric of hotel quality as a function of stairwell atmosphere. A relief to be back after the mistake of a rather dodgy hotel in the same area last time I was in Birmingham. 
2; Bed rooms are spacious and very clean. Huge bed with lovely linen, great big decent power shower which makes all the difference.  The Hotel mainly orientated towards business and conference facilities, but set in a fantastic old hall with some lovely grounds and big mature trees. Breakfast was fabulous - the best bit by far. 
2; Great hotel, very well positioned, friendly and attentive. Breakfast was terrific !! very near to tube (Gloucester Road) Staff helpful, and rooms very cosy 
2; Once again, I have enjoyed a good stay at a Shaftesbury Hotel, this time the Park Grand Hyde Park. This time, I arranged for my parents also to stay and they were very happy with the hotel, the room and the service.  We only had two minor complaints.  Both of our rooms became extremely warm and we had to have the windows open all night.   The other small complaint was that the iron in my room was pretty useless although did the job eventually. I was in a hurry so did not have time to change it.  Other than these two issues, I would recommend the hotel and will continue to use this chain. The staff are very helpful, the rooms are clean, well appointed and comfortable. Prices were extremely reasonable. 
2; Reception dealt efficiently with a lengthy queue at the start of the check in time.  First impression of the room wasn't great, as it was cold, had a few large stains on the carpet, no fridge in the room and no ice machine available near by as an alternative. However, once we got the radiator on, closed the curtains, dimmed the light and got an ice bucket from the bar it felt like a nicer room. Bed was firm but comfortable.  Bar and restaurant service was polite and efficient. Restaurant menu was underwhelming, so went into town to eat (which was a short walk). Continental breakfast was fine, but cooked items not very warm.  £8 for car parking (raised from the £5 on our confirmation and in-room info) bit of a cheek, considering the cost of the room and the food/drink.  Enjoyed the stay over all and would recommend, but wasn't completely blown away. 
2; Bagged a complimentary upgrade to a club room. My room was a very good size for london, and well appointed. Large comfortable bed with a few chairs to sit on.  The price was fantastic and included English breakfast. Will definitely stay here again and again. 
2; The hotel is very clean and tidy, it the largest building in Harrogate. The rooms are large and spacious with two chairs and table to sit and watch the television. The views are amazing if you are on a high floor (11 floors). The walls are slightly thin so can hear others in there rooms but you get used to it. In the hotel there is a small gym which you can use, you just have to ask for a card to swipe in.  Location is good only a short walk to the bars and restaurants in Harrogate. Harrogate is a really nice town with great shopping and a great place to walk around.  You can also use the Health and spa off site it's called the academy it's about a 10 minutes walk or 5 minutes in the car.  Parking is charged at £7 for 24 hours and is underneath the hotel.   Overall a good hotel and good value for money if you get it at a cheap price.  
2;" We went to a Warners Leisure Hotel for the first time on August 8th for four nights at Holm Lacy five miles out from Hereford. On arrival we were greeted at the door and given the welcome pack before even getting out of the car and instructed where to park. We had booked a &quot;Historic&quot; room in the main house so could use the closest car park to the front door from where our luggage was portered with us to our room, number 206 with a view to the east towards the village. The room was fine with the exception of the mattress on the sleigh bed which had quite a lot of &quot;sag&quot; This was duly reported and an attempt to rectify this made only partially sucessfully. We also had to ask for a lighter duvet as the one supplied was far too hot for August! The house and grounds are a delight, large and well kept and a pleasure to stroll around. There are mini golf and putting greens and also air rifle and archery available although we did not partake in any of these as we preferred to go out during the daytime to see Hereford Cathedral, the Black and White villages and even got into Wales and saw the Black Mountains and Brecon Beacons, although it appeared many of the guests did not leave the venue until it was time to go home. Food generally was good and no problem with good choices. We tended to judge this holiday break against ships as we are long time cruisers. Ok, the actual main house was like staying in a Parador in Spain with large rooms and elegant oak staircases and the staff helpful. The entertainment in the evening was in a large auditorium called the Pavilion where sound levels were abnormally loud. I wear hearing aids in both ears and had to turn them both off and leave them in to act as ear plugs to make it bearable. The resident singers and dancers were poor and not worth watching although having said that the two acts brought in on separate nights, the comedians Lloyd Hollett and Rikki Jay were very good indeed.These were on Tuesday and Wednesday nights respectively. On the Thursday afternoon the &quot;Magic Trumpeter&quot; John Barker played outside on the Terrace overlooking the gardens and he was superb...If you think of Aker Bilk as the tops on a clarinet think of John Barker likewise on the trumpet. So, overall not a bad break, a bit like a cruise without a ship and the sea....would we go again?, yes, but to a different venue as I'm sure other Warner venues are worth investigating. "
2; This hotel is on the outskirts of York, and There is a handy Park and Ride into the centre of York two minutes down the road, with buses every 10 minutes. The hotel is roomy and comfortable, although the drinks and food are overpriced. Unfortunaterly all the rooms are non smoking, which meant a walk out in to the cold and wet to satisfy my craving. Otherwise a very comfortable hotel, where the service is excellent, and the staff are friendly and welcoming.  There is an excellent pub 300 yards down the road to York, where the food and drink prices are far better than those in the hotel, and there are nomerous retaurants and bars in York itself.  All in all, a very pleasant stay. 
2; Had a two night stay here recently, we were greeted with two glasses of champagne and staff were very friendly! Room was very clean and tidy. Very close to all the city attractions and we also mention it was my girlfriends 21st and Upton return from the city centre we was surprised to see a happy birthday chocolate brownie. Excellent all around trip and would recommend to anyone 
2; Just got back from a wkend theatre break in London,Stayed at this hotel and thought it was very nice. Our original room was a standard double which we were in to start with but upgraded to a superior double, was much bigger and worth the offer of an extra £20 to upgrade to it.The Hotel wasn't perfect but hey where is, what one likes another does not. Personally i thought this hotel was nice. Couldn't fault cleanliness of rooms, lobby was very nicely decorated, decor of rooms bit dull but still of good taste. Bathroom was lovely, big bath to relax in but have to say the bed was just wonderful, huge and very comfortable. Seen other reviews written, complaining of noise, but wasn't disturbed by noise once. The downsides were the breakfast, sausages like rubber and fried eggs not cooked fully, big selection though, the general hotel service was also very slow, ordered food via room service, it seemed to take rather a long time to get to us and when it did it wasn't particularly hot, not great when it cost approx £26 for a burger with fries and a large sandwich.The front reception can be quite slow, and waited 2 hrs for someone to look at tv as it was playing up, but by the time we had to depart the room still no one had come up to look at it.. The prices of the items in the mini bar were rather steep £4 for a can of drink, £8 for a small bottle of alcohol etc. Anyway they are quite minor moans and wouldn't put me off staying there again. Would recommend :-) 
2;This Hotel is worth every penny and more, the style and comfort are second to none.  Me and my Fiancee checked in for one night on Sunday 5th October with spa treatments. Upon arrival we were greeted by an extremely friendly receptionist who checked us in, i wish i got his name because he is a real credit to the hotel, he gave us every bit of information we would need and more even let us choose the floor of the hotel we wanted then gave us a garden view.  The room has everything you would need for it to be a comfortable night sleep we dropped our bags off and headed to the spa for a treatment at 4pm, upon arrival at the Spa we were 'greeted' by 3 young lads who just stared at us like we had arrived in fancy dress. When eventually the lad did speak to us he told us the treatment was at 3, which is bizarre as you cant even check into the hotel before 3pm and the confirmation email confirmed 4pm treatments. The only information we got was that the lockers are £1 and got given towels, all three of them stood looming around a desk was rather intimidating for myself never mind my fiancee, to say they were unhelpful and intimidating would be the understatement of the century.  We got out of the pool to head for our treatments one of the lads walked us upstairs told us to take a seat then continued to whisper with his friend and the girls who were doing the treatments, the whispering might have been completely unrelated to us however given the manner in which they had reacted to us in the first place i highly doubt it.  The Treatments however and the girls that did them were fantastic, it was my first time having anything like this done and she made me feel at ease and was very good at what she does, you couldn't possibly find a problem with the way both girls conducted themselves, very friendly and very relaxing.  Finally breakfast after a great nights sleep, buffet style breakfast which was extremely good, the selection of hot food, cereals and continental available was so good it was impossible to leave without feeling full and satisfied that you have got your moneys worth.  Overall a fantastic hotel, bar the three unhelpful guys at the spa desk, avoid them and it will be one of the best hotels you'll ever stay in.
2; We booked the Pentahotel as a last minute stop over, the bedrooms are clean & tidy, the location is great for China town, the mail box & broad St. The breakfast is by far the best of any Birmingham hotel I have stopped at, including Mal Maison. To sum up,friendly staff, good food, clean rooms and great rates, I would stay there again. 
2; My family and I stayed for 1 night in an Executive King Room, as it was for a special occasion. The room was smart, with access to the Executive Lounge, providing sandwiches, cakes and beverages. The staff members were all polite and friendly. A Turn-down service is advertised but this didn't happen and when I asked at reception, they said that as we were only staying for 1 night, we weren't getting that service. This was one of the main reasons I booked, as it was an expensive, luxurious room, and it isn't advertised as being for more than 1 night stays. I felt as if my business wasn't appreciated 'only' being there for 1 night and this ruined the occasion for us. Also, we left our room at 7pm to go out for the evening and there was a lot of rubbish in the hallway left outside 2 of the rooms and when we came back at 11.30pm, it was still there. This didn't create a good impression. I don't know if there is a lack of cleaning staff and maybe this is the real reason for the Turn-down service not happening. Anyway, it was a lovely hotel but let down by being made to feel second class 'only' staying for 1 night.... 
2; Titanic is a word that can certainly be applied to their rooms as they are huge, they are also very comfortable, have extremely good beds and an equally spacious bathroom. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and the food was excellent. The down side for me would be the lighting as this was very poor in the corridors as you exited the lift for your room or vice versa, I am sure anyone who is in any way visually impaired would struggle with this. It is not the easiest place to find either as there is a tight turn into the courtyard however once you arrive it is well worth the visit. 
2; Today, I visited the hotel for lunch with friends, and marveled at the building and enjoyed the very good service which was given, but the visit was badly let down by the quality of the steak we had for lunch. It was cooked the way we wanted but it was just barely edible due to being tough with a lot of gristle and this was echoed by two other fellow diners. We didn't complain as we were being treated, but I would ask the kitchen to please review your meat supplier. This spoiled what was otherwise a very pleasant visit. 
2; Lovely set up... Be back soon. Really loved the feel of the place. To take my lady there was brill. We loved it. Spacious rooms. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a romantic getaway in York   
2;My wife and myself often call in to The Bedford Lodge. We live in the area and often eat out. You dont go wrong here for a good bar meal the menu is simple yet good and the wine list is very good. Service is excellent and we find the Bedford warm and comfortable. Never stayed as we live nearby but we would always reccomend.
2; We enjoyed our 2 night stay at this hotel, although apprehensive after reading some of the reviews. We found the food enjoyable, the room was nice, very warm, adequate tea/coffee making facilities, quick running bath with plenty of hot water and the bed was comfy. Small pool, but again adequate. The location was ideal to explore the area, just off the M1. We walked to the East Midlands Shopping Outlet (15 minutes walk) and drove through the dales to Chatsworth House, Matlock Bath and the town of Bakewell where we had, of course, an afternoon tea with cherry bakewell! 
2; Thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at Balmer Lawn. Great location in the New Forest, and if you didn't know the hotel was in the New Forest before your arrival, you certainly did as you drove past several very cute little ponies grazing on the hotel lawn! A short walk behind the hotel takes you onto some beautiful walks and trails populated by wild horses and deer.  The hotel is worth a visit for its situe alone, but we were also impressed by the food. Dinner wasn't cheap, but you don't mind paying money for good food and it really was very good!  The Spa area is very relaxing and I can recommend the massage.  Even the rooms were decent and not as 'tired' as some of the reviews suggest. My only complaint concerns the content of the room ('Superior' by name but not by much else). Having enjoyed a pre-dinner walk, I planned to shower and then relax in a robe whilst my wife soaked in a bath and washed her hair. The plan didn't quite unfold as hoped. No shampoo (although there was conditioner?), no robe, and no hairdryer.   Don't get me wrong, me going into dinner with dirty hair and my wife going into dinner with long, wet hair, was not going to spoil our break, but it meant a potentially perfect stay wasn't quite perfect. Were we expecting too much of our Superior Room to contain shampoo, bathrobes and a hairdryer? Or have we just been spoilt in the past?!   Minor complaints considering location and dining, but complaints nevertheless.   
2;" A nice hotel in an excellent part of the city. Central and handy for shopping and Northern Quarter. Staff were friendly and helpful; car parking is available at £15 for 24 hours. Room was attractive and modern with all amenities and good panoramic view of the city. "
2; Ok, so the location isn't fantastic BUT if you take this hotel on its own merits it is very good.  Public areas are modern and very clean. Greeting at reception was warm and check in speedy.  The room was great, large and up to date and a very comfortable bed.   The bar was very nice and also quiet but drinks prices were quite high.  We didn't eat here so can't comment on the food.  The fitness centre was good. Very new and enough cardio and resistance machines to have a decent workout.  Excellent stay, especially considering the price we paid! 
2;Me my wife and our daughter stayd at the Grand Royale for my birthday and i must say that the whole service was impeccable , in particular the two receptionist Rita and Anifa.  I highly recommend this hotel.  Roberto P.
2; I used to work for a big chain hotels, so wasn't expecting a lot. To my surprise, the room was perfect, the staff polite, even the bar didn't close at 11pm precise. Over all the stay was comfortable and nice. The only downside the staff should smile more often :P 
2; I arrived late, after 11pm, after a flight from holiday in Sweden. I was processed swiftly and given a large double bedroom with everything you'd expect from a 4 star. No complaints about the room. My only moan would be that the breakfast the following morning was an admittedly generous English breakfast - eat as much as you like - but cost somewhere in the region of £16, which I regard as a bit extortionate for a fry-up.  I'll still stay there again. 
2; A good quality hotel, reasonably sized room and helpful staff. The hotel was a welcoming place to stay and well positioned for the local tube station (Bayswater or Queensway). Easy travel to theatres and other attractions in London. Everything was as advertised and it was a pleasure to stay here. 
2; i have stayed here a few times now and the position is very good it has recently had a refit the staff were friendly and beds were very comfortable 
2; Was here in late november for the Variety Children's Charity tribute dinner to the Hillsboro 96 what a great hotel food was great and especially breakfast rooms clean but smallish the staff amazing  had a nightmare with my laptop and the guy from concierge sorted it and the girl who served breakfast was so so helpful as i am on a no carb diet great staff 
2; stayed here for park saty fly package over easter 2016. Was a little expensive (£144 for room & 8 days parking) but again this package does what it says on the tin. Good rooms, good food and car looked after as expected and ready for collection upon return. Transfers to and from airport included and very prompt. This hotel was very busy when we stayed but managed to cope OK. Will definately use again when needed. 
2; We have stayed at the Lower Slaughter Manor a number of times, including our first weekend away together 5 years ago.  It is a lovely, welcoming hotel, which despite some of the grandeur feels homely (see the walking boots lined up by the front door for guests to borrow, and brandy in the room to have a nightcap).  Yes there are some quirks, but there tend to be in old British buildings. We always stay in the Charlotte room as a reminder of our first trip together, and we love it there. It has its own entrance corridor, a huge bedroom suite with two comfy chairs at the end of the bed to read the paper and have a coffee in the morning, the comfiest bed I have ever slept in, and huge bathroom with double sized shower.   The food is always great: breakfast is a continental buffet (with cooked elements prepared to order rather than left standing), and in the evening the meal is brilliant (certainly comparable to our favoured London restaurants).  The staff are always helpful, and will even contact you ahead of your stay to see whether you want anything particular arranged for your arrival (i.e. champagne/wine on ice in the room, flowers etc).  For those who like the Cotswolds, the location is pretty prefect. It is a very short walk to Upper Slaughter and the nearby mill-cafe, across the road is a nice pub/hotel (which I believe is owned by the same people) which is great on a summer's evening, and is about 15-20minute walk from Bourton-on-Water along a stream and across a couple of fields (it is well signposted).  The only downside is that it is not cheap, but we have quite often been able to find good board and meal offers that make it far more reasonable. I would not say that it is the best place for a family (no pool etc) but for a couples weekend it is pretty much perfect. 
2; What you would expect from Hotel Du Vin. Rolltop bath, fragrant bath stuff and soaps, fluffy dressing gowns, comfortable beds with ironed sheets and well appointed rooms.  The Cambridge hotel is in the centre of historic Cambridge in a grand Georgian building a few doors from Browns. Parking is a bit of a problem but I believe the hotel run a parking service whereby a driver can take your car to a secure parking area and return it at a designated time. We have always parked in the Pay and Display spaces outside which are free after a certain time.   The only place to stay in Cambridge that will bring a smile to your wife's face, guaranteed. 
2; The 3 day stay was good as was the food and service, however the weather was hot as was the room, no air condioning ?? I would say the stay in general was good the location was ok for us, there was also a bus stop close by. 
2;" We have stayed here before when it was a DeVere hotel and I am sure we will return again even though it is now a Q hotel. We stayed on a Groupon deal and were in &quot;The Penthouse&quot;. First reaction was....wow ! It is huge with a dining area, non working kitchen area, lounge area with leather chesterfield sofa and chairs, a second bedroom and of course a bathroom. The only real let down was the shower which could do with a little TLC. The water was always hot (eventually) but the wall mounted jets don't work and on inspection it doesn't look like they've worked for a long time. The overhead shower could do with being a bit more powerful (in our opinion). We ate in the restaurant the first night and the service wasn't the quickest as they had at least three coach parties booked in and not sure if they were all dining at the same time but our waiter apologised and said the kitchen was under a lot of pressure. Second evening we decided to have a bar meal as we thought it would be a little quicker (still three coach parties booked in). Service was still a little slow but after our main course my wife ordered &quot;cheesecake of the day&quot; and after 20 minutes it still hadn't arrived. We called a waiter over and he apologised and said &quot;the kitchen staff are absolutely swamped looking after the coach parties in the dining room. My response was that surely &quot;cheesecake of the day&quot; isn't a difficult order to produce a bit quicker than 20 minutes. After a further 10 minutes his colleague (perhaps manager) arrived with the cheesecake, apologised for the delay and offered us a free drink each which neither of us wanted so he deducted the cheesecake from our bill. At least he dealt with our (we think valid) complaint in a proper manner. We enjoyed our stay here and as I said above I'm sure we will return but if the kitchen are under such pressure when coach parties are booked in perhaps staffing needs to be looked at. Had we been paying full price for the Penthouse not staying on a Groupon deal I think we would have felt differently. "
2; I have stayed here on two separate occasions with work.  The hotel is clean, pleasant and the staff are pleasant & attentive (but not overbearing).   The rooms are comfortable and I found the rooms quiet (I couldn't here the trains from Euston station adjacent).  The food in the restaurant on a evening is very good, with prices being very competitive especially for London. The same food can be ordered in the bar area. The drink prices aren't aren't bad either.   My only criticism is that not all guests are told the restaurant is open for evening meals, as fellow colleagues weren't aware it was open.  There are lifts to all floors.  Check in times between 5-7pm on a Monday can take a bit of time, due to a large volume of guests arriving at the same time.   Would I come here again? Defiantly  Would I recommend to others? Yes 
2; Almost 12 years since we first visited this hotel & we've never been disappointed. We just booked B&B this time. We had a room on the very top of the old Priory building. Quite a few steps & some creaky floorboards near the top, all character stuff. It certainly wasn't the biggest or fanciest room we've stayed in here. The hotel was the quietest it's ever been when we've been previously- maybe why there was special rates- partially why we chose to go again. It was lovely to stay in the old part of the hotel. 
2; I thought the lay out was good. I wasn't to sure when I first got in but it was actually alright. I headed down from Aberdeen with my dad to watch the footie in Manchester. Overall I would definitely recommend it again and would not hesitate to stay here again 
2;" Great hotel, very clean and modern in style and decor. Situated overlooking Fistral beach, the hotel boasts great views, especially from its decked veranda (just the other side of the small car park directly in front of the hotel). Rooms and bathrooms are spacious. Very pleasant staff (especially the bar staff). Unfortunately we didn't have time to explore the spa - with the beach on your doorstep we made the most of the outdoors.  The beach is about a five minute walk away (down steep steps) and to walk from one end of the beach to the other involves climbing over rocks so not ideal for the elderly, but it's possible to drive to the other end of the beach near the beach bar and restaurant which is a more accessible way to the beach.   Breakfast was very good (with excellent vegetarian options) but there was a slight issue with service. There's a great choice of breakfast items; cereals and continental, along with cooked breakfast options. The full English was very nice, good size and good quality. The eggs benedict was also nice. The issue was that we waited nearly an hour. The first 30mins went by fairly quickly as we were being served tea and coffee and helping ourselves to some fruit, it also states on the menu 'please be patient our breakfast is cooked fresh'. Fine, so we were politely being patient but then a waiter asked if everything was ok? Said we're still waiting. Turns out the order was misplaced and nothing had been cooked. Ok mistakes happen, but what I found most unusual was that the blame was pointed to us for not mentioning it sooner. Your menu says please be patient?? 'But you should've said something'. An apology would've been better received. I also asked a waitress for a pot of tea and she disappeared never to be seen again - I didn't wait around that time! On the plus side the breakfast room interior design is very well done, stylish, clean and modern.   This is a great hotel to base yourself, from which to explore Cornwall by car. We had a day in Newquay, St Ives and Padstow, a day in each felt sufficient. Tip - in St Ives make a restaurant reservation, these get filled up pretty quickly - it wasn't even the school holidays!   I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're looking to stay near Newquay. "
2; Booked as a special offer, it was pot luck when we went for The Old Ship Hotel. told friends and had mixed reviews from them, however, we stayed in between Christmas and the New Year and all I can say is it was excellent, From the welcome at reception to the nice bright room (although extremely cold - requested a heater and one was sent to us immediately problem solved) - bathroom was also cold but spacious  Evening meal faultless Afternoon tea even better Breakfast - OK Friendly welcoming old Hotel with loads of history  we will be back for sure. 
2; This hotel is a 12 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads station and is located perfectly for shops and access to the City centre as its name implies. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was spacious with a view over the city to the front of the hotel. I've read other reviews moaning about the tired decor and whilst a refresh is due it didn't detract from a wonderful stay. I will definitely return 
2; Stayed for wife's birthday last Saturday room was spacious and clean food was lovely hospitality was good would stay again spa was not what I expected but nevertheless was ok drinks were expensive well over priced food prices were reasonable breakfast was good   
2; I've stayed here now twice on a work trip for a total of 6 nights. Both times the rooms were very modern and spotlessly clean. First I had a room on the 11th floor with a great view of the big wheel and Piccadilly, next an 8th floor room overlooking Portland Street.  The room on the 11th floor I remembered as being ever so slightly larger and completely silent. The 8th floor room was pretty quiet, but could hear some noise from next door.  Despite the rooms looking very modern, the only downside was that the TV didn't have a HDMI port so that I could connect my own devices - they seem to be getting on a bit and maybe a year or two before the HDMI boom.  Otherwise, very happy with my stay. Ate 3 breakfasts and 3 evening meals - all were good quality, but a little on the expensive side for the area. However, this is a common complaint of mine with all hotels. 
2; We have just returned from a two day break at the Ettington Chase Hotel. What a lovely hotel, all the staff are friendly, polite and efficient. They are always ready to help. The rooms are clean and very comfortable beds and the bathroom was spotless. Our break consisted of two nights bed and Breakfast with dinner included on the first night. The Restaurant was really first class with lovely décor. The restaurant had a gourmet menu which we would not normally choose. I chose roll Belly Pork, not realizing that the meal did not include potatoes or vegetables. I spoke to the waitress, who apologise and informed us that we could order potatoes and vegetables as a side order for a extra charge. My partners choice (Trout) came with mash and vegetables, she felt that the vegetables was under cook. However the food was well presented. The breakfast buffet was one of the best we have had, a good choice. My partners Birthday break overall was a success and we would recommend the Hotel  K & H, East Yorkshire 
2; We were in a room about as far as you can get form the reception and restaurant, so although it was a fair walk, it had good views over the golf course and was one of the quietest rooms I've stayed in. I would ask for the same room again (275).  All of the staff we encountered were professional and friendly.  The room looked like it had been refurbished recently and was clean, modern and comfortable (although the fridge didn't work).  The restaurant had a good menu for starters and mains, but the sweet choices were unimaginative and not up to the standard of everything else. On our second night something in the kitchen set the fire alarm off part way through our meal, so we all had to stand in the car park until it was deemed safe to go back in! When we returned, the restaurant staff were apologetic and made sure everyone's meals were sorted out as soon as possible. I got the distinct impression false fire alarms are not a rare occurrence, so perhaps someone needs to alter something.  We found lots of places to visit (Isaac Newton's house, Southwell Workhouse, Southwell Minster etc), and will stay here again as we ran out of time before we had seen everything. Belton House across the road is worth a visit. 
2; Stayed here for NEW YEARS EVE. So brilliant for closeness to Thames and fireworks. Staff helpful, Although tv didn't work when first arrived and staff slow to respond. Breakfast in room was good and filling. Only stayed one night but generally good. 
2; The Montague is lovely, very central,helpful staff and lovely rooms but beware how you book. If you book through websites you may, like us, discover when leaving the hotel that you have an extra 17.50% added to your bill. We were unaware that the room rate quoted on the website did not include VAT so when leaving we were charged £129 more than we expected.  So make sure you have enough credit on your card or extra money in your pocket!!!!! 
2;To be honest this hotel is the type you'd only use for business type purposes or perhaps to stay pre-early morning flight. Nevertheless it is a very good example of its kind.  From check in to check out everything worked smoothly. All the staff I had dealings with were both knowledgeable and friendly - and in my experience that is not always the case. Hilton it seems have a pretty good staff development programme.  The room itself was fine - it had all the tings you expect and they all worked easily. My food experience was limited to breakfast - buffet style and good and a finger buffet which was also better than average.  In short I'd use this hotel again if I were at an NEC event or had to stay in the Birmingham area for business purposes.
2; We needed somewhere to stay the night before heading off on the Eurostar so were looking for a comfortable hotel within a short distance of St Pancras. This one fitted the bill.  It offers everything you would expect from a Hilton hotel - nothing particularly unusual but clean, comfortable and with good quality service.  Upon arrival we had a very short queue for check in and whilst we waited we were given delicious, warm chocolate cookies - a definite bonus for Hubby. Check in was easy and we were soon off to our room.  The room was spacious, clean and well presented with all the amenities you would expect - basic toiletries, tea / coffee facilities, safe etc.  There is a well stocked bar serving meals as well as a separate restaurant. We opted to eat in the bar. Prices are typical London prices but not unreasonable given the location. The service in the bar was excellent and the food was good. Hubby would go as far as saying very good for the burger, which was apparently a particularly tasty piece of meat. Hubby was also pleased with the good selection of gin, and it appears there is a good selection of whisky too.  We cannot comment on breakfast since we didn't partake but from what we saw a good selection was available.  Upon check out we had a taxi to St Pancras ordered for us, approximately a 5 minute journey to St Pancras. (Though likely to be longer at peak traffic times).  This hotel gave us just what we needed and an excellent start to our short break. 
2; Stayed as a couple on a great value deal for 3 nights as a long weekend, which included breakfast and dinner on the first night up to £25 per person. Would agree with many other comments made by others:  Car park is hard to find and expensive, as would expect it to be free on site, but compared to most large city centre car parks £16 per day is comparable.  Breakfast quality and choice is outstanding, but at £17.50 per person per day is a bit steep, and would not have taken it if not in the package - plenty of local eateries doing it much cheaper though unlikely to be as good or plentiful. Dinner was also good quality, so the food offering is consistently good.  Decor etc, is on the traditional side and befits a building of this age, and everything was spotlessly clean and tidy, if a little dated - but if you want modern and soul-less then other hotels are available!  Location is fantastic, right in the heart of a vibrant city and close to the attractions, shops, bars and restaurants etc, so I am afraid some noise is to be expected, but ear plugs were thoughtfully made available in the night stand drawer in case of need.  Staff were excellent and very helpful and polite, nothing was too much trouble.  Therefore, if you can get a deal package, this represents fantastic value for money, otherwise the stay would have been on the expensive side, but you do get what you pay for! 
2; This hotel is ideal for anyone attending Cheltenham Races.  Both receptionists were very friendly and helpful.  A nice touch was the male member of staff who organised many taxis to the course for guests - he was very efficient and pleasant to speak to.  Also, we checked in too early for our room to be ready but we were able to leave our bags with reception, and when we returned after the Races our bags were already in our room - nice touch.  The room was clean, pleasant and tastefully decorated.  The buffet breakfast was a little disappointing - the bacon was fatty, the sausages a little undercooked, the fried eggs were unpleasant, and I hate queuing to make my own toast.  But the scrambled eggs were very good, as were the mushrooms.  The staff who brought tea and coffee were very pleasant.  My wife and I will stay here again when racing at Cheltenham. 
2; Stayed here for one night whilst visiting the Badminton Horse Trials. We arrived well before check in but were lucky as our room was prepared, the reception staff were excellent and very friendly. The room seemed a 4 hour walk away on the 1st floor but we got there eventually. The room was 'ok' but the bathroom terribly dated, the bath was old and grubby and I wasn't a fan of the shower curtain which was well past its best. I've seen better bathrooms in Holiday Inns and would suggest this gets addressed. The bed made noise if you shifted your weight, blinked or even though about moving - but other than that was very comfortable. We used the pool which was OK - apart from being full of wedding guests. They have a 'no children slot' between 12 and 4 but this obviously wasn't policed particularly well as a baby was allowed to splash around whilst I was in there.  We used the bar and restaurant - both of which were 400 degrees, far too warm to be comfortable. The bar area was packed with a wedding party, all of whom were very noisy (military wedding) and whilst we were in the restaurant another wedding party kept walking through the room while everyone was trying to eat. I'd recommend sticking to the chefs table, although the food was excellent all round. The waitress was very attentive and well mannered. Only other downside being you've barely put your knife and fork down from your starter before your main is rushed out.  Overall nice place, good food and friendly staff. They just need to update the bathrooms and somehow segregate the wedding guests out so the 'normal' guests can have some peace and quiet. 
2;" Stayed all last week for a business training course nearby. On check in, found reception very helpful, polite and efficient. The housekeeping staff always had a cheery &quot;good morning/evening&quot;, etc. and the doormen similarly. Breakfast was tasty and plentiful. Only negative for me was the &quot;steam&quot; bar with overpriced and very poor quality Guiness. It was changed for lager, but it was obvious to look at that it was wrong and should not have been served. By knocking off the aircon you can get a better nights sleep, but the units must have been above my 6th floor room, so always a tad noisy. But the beds were very comfy and good bar/shower/tv, etc. "
2; classic double room very nice plenty of wardrobe space and the media centre for tv a nice touch, breakfast plenty of choice both cooked and continental. we particularly liked the hotel grounds great for exploring. excellent base for exploring brighton and eastbourne.  staff very helpful and are friendly will definitely visit again 
2; Stayed one night prior to flying from Heathrow on our holiday and stayed one night on our return. Both times we had a lovely room. Staff very helpful and accommodating. Room lovely and clean with those little extra touches which mean so much. Bed very comfy. Food excellent and a good variety. Grounds are gorgeous. Was made to feel very welcome, would definitely go back again. It was also very useful that the hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to and from the airport and we were able to leave our vehicle in the grounds of the hotel for the duration of our holiday and this was all in on the price. 
2; We popped into the hotel to feed the kids some lunch before going onto Battersea Park (opposite) so we can't comment on the accommodation. We looked at the restaurant but it was very formal and pricey. We ordered a sharing platter of Mediterranean & middle eastern 'mezze' amongst other light bites and were very pleasantly surprised at the authenticity and flavours. The staff were efficient and pleasant and the cost for a family of four including drinks from the bar was a very palatable £55. 
2;Potters mooring is in a beautiful part of devon called Shaldon& bordering with Teignmouth. unfortunately the roads are very narrow in the actual village of shaldon & you need your wits about you when driving/manouvering your car.Potters Mooring has spotlessly clean rooms & excellent room cleaners & the staff are very polite.Just wish the Potters Mooring was not so close to the Bowls Club as this restricts car manouvering in & out.
2; Came here for a one night stay for a family party. Loved the room and the staff were polite and friendly! Breakfast in the morning was also beautiful although we did have to wait about 30 minutes for 2 hot chocolates... Ahh well these things happen!! Where we stayed was perfect.. One side of the hotel had a stench of cigarette smoke but that wasn't our side haha! Would go back for sure for an overnight stop 
2; This hotel must be one of De vere best hotels, in my opinion better than Loch Lomond. The staff are really friendly and often service is above and beyond normal duties. The food was excellent in the Clarity Jug restaurant and again service equal. If you like to play golf the Hunting course is one of the best top 100 courses in the UK. The Priest man course is also very good, however, not as well manicured. We will definitely be revisiting. Thank you all for a great customer experience. 
2; We spent two nights here in a very well appointed room with a startling sea view. The service was near perfect, the restaurant very good with a wide breakfast choice.  Only complaint is that the parking is on a steep slope and is hazardous even if a bay is available. Easier to park in the street - if there is a space even there. 
2; We chose the Strand Palace Hotel initially because of it's close proximity to Covent Garden. We arrived at the hotel after a difficult journey, the receptionist was very pleasant and check in was quick and easy. We took the lift to our forth floor room, which was overlooking the Strand. As we had book theatre tickets we relaxed in our room with the complimentary Prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries. After taking advise from the concierge we walked to the restaurant and theatre using the complementary map. The show was brilliant and a easy stroll go us back to our room afterwards for a very comfortable night. I certainly found the hotel to be quiet, with no noise from other guests, or door slamming I have often experienced at other hotels. The following day after using the powerful shower we set off on our shopping trip which turned out to be exhausting too. Whist we were out the room was made up, with fresh towels etc. On the day we departed we took advantage of the left luggage facility which enabled us to enjoy or final day in London, we took a stroll along the river just a short walk from the hotel, without having to take our bags with us, we collected them later before boarding our train home. I would definitely recommend this hotel based on this experience compared to other hotels I looked at prior to booking it is good value for money, the location is great for Covent Garden and the surrounding area and finally the staff a very friendly and helpful. 
2;" Staying for business. Room very spacious, funky bar/restaurant area which began with disco themed music at the beginning of the week, to slowly up-tempo'ing to funky dance by the end of the week, coupled with a glitter ball over the entrance area!  Restaurant was nice; good service and tasty food.   My only gripe - noisy dual carriageway outside the room so quite noisy, despite double glazing. Maybe some better double glazing, or consider triple glazing even as unusually noisy compared to other urban based hotels I've stayed in. "
2; Third visit this year.... so clearly my wife and I enjoy the time spent at Warners Lakeside.  It was great to find new furniture in our 'lodge' and it was ready (serviced) in time for the 2pm occupancy.... a change for the better.  The food choice and quality had changed, for the better – except at breakfast when you wouldn’t find much left if you arrived near to (within half an hour) of finishing time. Even at an hour before they were nearly out of rolls and the last croissant had been issued!  The entertainment teams have changed some personal but there was no change in their brilliance. They are a truly most professional line-up of talented individuals.  What does need to change is the system for table reservations. As I said, third visit this year alone, we are members of the Warner’s Concierge Loyalty Club, yet we still get lousy (stage-view) dining/entertainment tables! This time we checked-in at the earliest possible time (12 noon) as advised we should do on our last visit, to secure decent reservations, but still the best seating had ‘gone’! It now appears, we were told, that it didn’t matter what time we checked-in because the coach drivers pick all the best tables well before 12 noon. This statement from the staff member upset a number of the guests, like us, queueing for their table allocation, at the correct time. I just think that if you book early enough you should be able to request a decent table location. If we were to book nearer the event, if could only be regarded as fair if we DID NOT get one of the best, seats in the house. We booked ages ago. First come – First served. Adding to that …. A LOYALTY CLUB. No loyalty being shown here.  The table location, as regular guests, spoiled what was otherwise a pleasant stay. Question mark over another return stay. 
2; Great little hotel. Loved the location and friendliness of the staff would definitely recommend and come again. Doesn't matter if it's business or pleasure it is ideal for both, small but friendly. Even got a welcome glass of decent red wine.    
2; We stayed here as a surprise 20th wedding anniversary present and were greeted with a complementary bottle of champagne and a card which was nice. The hotel is a bit faded and could do with a refurb. We found the staff friendly and helpful at all times. We had use of pool / gym/ sauna etc of which we took full advantage. We were in a suite overlooking the seafront and despite the main road and construction work there was no noise once the doors were closed.  Breakfast was very nice with plenty of choice to suit everyone. If eating out then make your way to preston street which is full of restaurants to suit all tastes. 
2; We stayed here for a long weekend, butlins has everything you need on site. You can pay to have food included, but we didn't so we went to the on site restaurants instead of the all inclusive buffet ones. Unfortunately the quality of food wasn't great and there were long waits for tables even though the restaurants were no where near full. The staff were very friendly but the restaurants did not seem organised. Apart from the food we really enjoyed our stay at Butlins, which is great value for money. We wouldn't let this put us off visiting again. 
2; Very comfatable beds, modern rooms and perfect views out over London. Although not the best location if west end nightlife is on the cards as taxis are fairly steep both ways and it's a good walk from the tube 
2; This was our second visit to the Greenbank. Its situated about 10 minutes walk from the centre of the town. The hotel is based around an old coaching inn so you should be prepared for a few winding corridors and stairs to find your room but its part of its charm. There is a lift so anyone with walking difficulties should be ok. Our room was a good size,clean and the bed was very comfortable. The dining room offers beautiful views over the harbour and there is an excellent lounge. We found the staff extremely helpful especially those in the dining room at breakfast.  The breakfast menu is excellent and I found the full english very tasty and well cooked my wife chose the haddock and was very impressed. We didn't sample the dinner menu as we were out each evening with friends.  Parking is at a premium in front of the hotel although there are additional spaces on the quay and close to hotel. Overall an excellent stay. The only suggestion I would make is that in the room we stayed in there were no trays or shelves in the shower cubicle. If this is the case in all rooms I suggest they are installed to offer somewhere to keep shampoo/soap etc 
2; We had a short two day break at Saunton which we thoroughly enjoyed, except for the appalling weather which only allowed us a 15 minute walk on the beautiful beach below our room. If you have not visited before you really should do. Not as far as Cornwall as nowhere near as busy, the area is a delight with this hotel adding icing to the cake. 
2; I visited the LAAMA show this week and used this hotel as a base, The good points is that the rooms are very comfortable with plenty of room and a really good bed in which I got a good nights sleep, the bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and spotlessly clean. The restaurant was good the food and service were excellent. The only things that slightly spoiled it for me was that the wait for service at the bar was too long and that evening the hot water wasn't that warm but basically a pretty good hotel 
2;Stayed overnight following the brilliant Hans Zimmer concert. Best thing about the hotel is the convenience. It is less than 5 minutes from the Apollo and half an hour to Liverpool St station from nearby Hammersmith tube. Room was comfortable and well equipped. Apart from a bit of trouble with a lift it was a good stay and I would return.
2; I really liked the yellow submarine, aquarium and Beetles memorabilia on the 2nd floor of this hotel! The room was large and comfortable. the staff were usually helpful. There waas a good choice of food at breakfast. 
2; Stayed here bank holiday weekend, rooms basic but clean. It is what you expect with the cheap price. Great location for Covent Garden and central London. Staff friendly and ready to help. There is a bit of noise from the main road the hotel is on but it is what you expect from a central London hotel. Would stay here again. 
2; Went to Harrogate the hotel was really nice and relaxing really nice room and clean and tidy. The food was well served and well organised by the staff and notrhing was too much trouble for them.  But at night after a long days travel and arrived at the hotel I wanted a shower and when it was switched on it was freezing cold water.  No directions or water temperature dial on it it was just chrome with a chrome push button in which was pressed several times but still run cold..  The building was originally the Queens Hotel and dates back to the 1600's but the shower was out dated and could see this was 25-30 years old.  On our trip there was some disabled and elderly people in a group of 50 and they all complained as the bath was high for them to step over into the shower and so many said at breakfast like me they could not shower as it was too dangerous to use!  Breakfast next morning I spoke to the receptionist who told me that to get the hot water I had to depress the button on the shower.  Thankyou but it still did not work. She was no help at all!  Tried again next morning and spoke to another receptionist and told she would get in a fitter that day!  When I arrived back that evening I tried the shower luckily I did not stand directly underneath it because it was scalding hot and would not turn it down.It was too dangerous to use this.  All showerrs should have temperasture controls clearly this would not have met the British Safety Council for 2013,  So you could not regulate it at all.  When I got back home I wrote to the Hotel Management who replied that a member of staff should have shown me how to use it.  I am not daft and could see perfectly well how to use this and found that comment useless really. Would he use this, I wonder?  The whole bath and shower needs replacing these modern times if anyone fell down in the bathroom or got burnt and in the room alone they would just lie there on the floor.  It is a pity because the hotel I found really good, and a good service but this spoilt my holiday without a proper functional shower!  I would come back when the showers are replaced and the only time, This spolit our holiday completely as the heat was over 30c outside and need a good shower.  I spent only a week there but found this long enough stay there! The rooms was noisy with guests arriving to their rooms late at night and leaving early morning and all the way down the corridors there was a loud banging of doors. The doors are all fitted with good locks and if you pull the door shut so the lock clicks it will shut and does not need to banged shut at all,All the doors was really good, so why do people have to bang shut the hotel doors each time it is so annoying and distrurbs other guests some are sleeping no thought at all for other guests in the hotel! The staff service was excellent though and food superb which made up for the rooms really! 
2; Stayed at the refurbished Salcombe Harbour Hotel as we spend time with family in Salcombe and would have continued to stay at the South Sands Hotel but for losing so much time using taxis and the Ferry for access to Salcombe particularly when ferrying beach chairs and life belts etc.  Top marks to the Concierge and Reception outstandingly helpful throughout our stay. The Hotel has been thoughtfully refurbished and we stayed in one of two main suites which were perfectly satisfactory with excellent views from the balcony but possibly a little less than you would expect for just short of £600 a night.  The Hotel is so convenient to the town that we were able to make so much more from our days and so Salcombe Harbour will be our future choice but South Sands gets the prize.  The one disappointment was the dining where our party of eight enjoyed excellent food but not the service to match. It didn't spoil the evening but we fleetingly saw who I assume was the Restaurant Manager and I think he may have reappeared with an apology after delays and three or four apologies for forgotten orders and for one of our guests main course failing to appear. The problems were compounded at breakfast each morning with oversights and delays with only the busy Manageress apparently able to take orders. The problem was the system rather than for want of trying.  If the Restaurant operated as efficiently as the Reception then it would be a Five Star Rating. My suggestion would be to put the Head Receptionist in charge of the Restaurant as she understands and excels in customer service. I gather from talking to locals that our experience in the Restaurant was no surprise. 
2; The Bull Hotel is very charming, great location with very comfy rooms newly decorated. The hotel reception staff is exceptionally helpful and very friendly. The hotel is very clean and the public areas are appealing, especially the outside grounds when the weather is nice and sunny. Beautiful gardens well kept with comfortable garden chairs to sit for a drink, have breakfast, or a bite to eat over lunch. The only drawback is the restaurant service is very slow, tables are not regularly cleared and it's hard to get the attention of the staff. The Sunday Jazz lunch is a great idea, good Jazz band and good quality food. This would have been much nicer if the hotel hadn't organised a children’s birthday party at the same time.  All in all a very pleasant stay, we would be happy to return. :) 
2; on arrival at this spectacular hotel i was much disappointed at the décor. The greeting was much more to my standards.The lay out of the bedroom was spacious, clean and tidy. Fantastic location, beautiful gardens. 
2; A lovely stay and the rooms (The Cathedral and Quays rooms) were superb. The bar and restaurant staff are efficient and friendly, and the grounds are lovely too, A great place for a relaxing break in the countryside. 
2; There are two Marriotts in Bristol, and, yes, I went to the wrong one first. The City Centre-titled Marriott is actually slightly further out from the city centre than its sister facility, Marriott Royal, so a bit confusing... to the locals, too, who all thought that the dome-topped Marriott was the central version. The two hotels are also quite different. Since I went to the 'Royal' first, it's worth mentioning that it's the old style of the traditional grand. In style as well as in operation, the whole feel had the opulent texture of a bygone era. The City Centre version was definitely commercial but the staff were extremely personable and professional. A big trade show was in full swing for the duration of my stay here, so no good if you wanted a quiet time. Very pricey for facilities offered. For example, not a lot of change from a tenner for two very mediocre coffees, courtesy of a Starbucks franchise. I think the nearby Holiday Inn might serve the businessman better. [QED]. 
2;" Stayed overnight before a trip to Cuba in June 2013. Clean, efficient, convenient and value for money. Pleasant staff and a friendly atmosphere.  That said......I found that my newly valeted car had mud all over the drivers footwell and oddly in the back too and had managed to cover 11 miles in the trip from the parking space where I left it to the &quot;secure&quot; parking 40 yards away. "
2; In spite of the weather we had the view of the house when arriving at Littlecote is beautiful. What a place. Great welcome from receptionist, two room keys and our charge card sorted we unloaded the luggage and strolled to our standard room in the new part of the hotel. Very clean and well presented. I then went to drive the car from the drop off at reception to a car park. Quite a struggle to find somewhere to park beyond the new part of the hotel. It is best, we found, to park beyond the historic side of the hotel. OK that entailed a walk through the historic half of the hotel to our room beyond reception. Not a problem but you do not resolve the car park issue until you are familiar with the hotel layout. Some of the rooms have allocated parking. It may be an idea to check this out when booking. When you have checked in ensure you stroll across to the leisure centre to book early for the rifle shooting or archery. All spaces taken when we tried to book on our first morning before breakfast. (From your room you can call telephone number 352 which is straight to the leisure centre desk). We highly recommend the historic house tour. We did this on the 31st Jan. Really informative, lively and entertaining house guide. Kept our interest all the way through and for the older clients was most considerate for the steps and doors that were negotiated during the tour. Approx 90 minutes and excellent value. Good to explore the Roman ruins also. View the Roman ruins soon because the spectacular mosaic may be completely covered for preservation purposes. The breakfast was really good however the evening meals that we had in the Popham were a little disappointing on the vegetable side of things. We did not expect what appeared to be frozen peas and sweetcorn from a four star hotel. We found the restaurant staff attentive and very courteous. We were pleased with the price we paid but do not believe it would be worth the full price. 
2; Stayed 2 nights recently visting friends. The building is the former Liberal Club and is an impressive red terracotta clad pile only minutes walk from the station. The grand curving staircase with large stained glass windows which forms a backdrop to the reception area is an amazing sight. On the first floor at the top of the staircase is a small but nicely furnished honesty bar, open limited hours. Our room was adjacant to the bar and was large, comfortable and well furnished. The beds and pillows are very good but some traffic noise was apparent from Quebec Street despite the secondary glazing. Not overly noticeable unless you are a light sleeper.  The bathroom was also large and well supplied with Gilchrist and Soames toiletries, bathrobes, slippers and good quality towels. We had booked a deluxe room on a weekend package at around £175 for 2 nights without breakfast and thought it good value. Breakfast was available at an extra cost in a conservatory room on the 4th floor. Reasonable choice of breakfast items although in common with many UK hotels no freshly squeezed orange juice. Why this is beyond most hotels is a mystery to me.  This minor niggle aside this is a very good hotel in a convenient location and I would return in future. 
2; we arrived at the hotel on Saturday 31 Aug at about 4pm, the welcome at reception was warm and welcoming, the room was nice clean and tidy. We used the spar which again was good. I booked a table in the conservatory for dinner, that was lovely the meal was excellent and really helpful staff. Very restful sleep with no noise. (but there were no weddings on when we stayed). Breakfast in the morning well i had to send our first cooked breakfast back as it was cold, but staff attended to that issue very swiftly and returned with a hotter breakfast. Overall the hotel was very good and we will certainly look at going back sometime. 
2; I stayed at the Grand Hotel, with my partner and my elderly mother, at the start of October. My mother suffers from dementia and mobility difficulties. So the patience and empathy shown by all the staff was really welcome. I really must commend all of them for an exemplary level of customer service.  We stayed in one of the hotel's suites, because it suited my mother's needs. It had recently been nicely redecorated and is very pleasant and a very good size. However, I'm not sure that it is really worth the very high price we were charged. The only thing that lets the hotel down is that some of its public areas are looking a bit tired and are really in need of refurbishment. 
2; Near one of the main stations but quiet. Comfortable room was waiting us, but before we received a warm and yummy cookie. All the staff was nicely. Perhaps walls were a little thick and you will hear some noises and doors closing 
2; we recently stay at Park Plza Nottingham and really happy with our choice. the room is really nice - however it was a bit dark, and service is good. the hotel is really near the city centre ( 2 minutes walking), which is really convinient. 
2;We stayed here the night before the London Marathon, and chose it because of the location. But I would definitely stay here again as it's easy to get to, was great value, and very comfortable. Wish I'd had the chance to eat in the restaurant. Our room was on the 8th floor, spacious, clean, comfortable - all you could ask for in a hotel. Apart from that, the other reason for staying here as opposed to something more central is the view - it's slightly away from the centre but close to the river, and it's not surrounded by other high rises so the view from our room was fabulous. London really looked fine.
2; If you want to be close to the Airport or NEC this is the hotel to stay at.  I really liked the lounge area in the ground floor, great to have a relaxing snack, bar meal and have a drink at the bar.  The Exec lounge is really good too if your a HH member, would recommend using it. Check in was really slick and there was always staff available to help with any requests.  The gym and swimming pool were well worth visiting and if your at a conference or business meeting here you will be well looked after.  The three restaurants were all really good and I would recommend any of them, the breakfast was also really good and loads to choose from.  The rooms are really good, spacious and modern.  I really liked this Hilton and have stayed here quite a few times.   If you have any questions feel free to drop me a message. 
2; We stayed here on our way Thailand.  Really quick & efficient check in/out  Nice rooms with everything that you would need & expect from a Novotel establishment.  Only down side was that the breakfast was terrible,food was freezing cold & inedible. 
2; Great position to get to everywhere quickly. Loads of quality bars and restaurants within a short walk.  Hotel has a well stocked champagne bar. Will definitely use again.  Comfy bedroom and excellent bathroom, separate shower was huge.  We visited for a birthday and it ticked all our boxes.   
2; Nice Hotel with very good rooms. The bed, en-suite, TV, shower all good. The bar, gym and restaurant are also very good. The staff are also friendly - maybe overly (floating meter and greeters) so in an American way which is a little off putting for us Brits maybe So far so good. £15 a day for wi-fi in your room!!!! Not happy with that at all. Also a bottle of water in your room - be careful as it is £3.95. This is not mentioned on arrival, nor in your greeting letter. It is on a tag on the bottle. Now I know I should have read the label but I didn't. When my colleagues were discussing the water I realised my error and asked the desk not charge me for my mistake which they kindly did. BUT I asked how often this happens and was told once a week - so if once a week they don't charge how much do they make on this from unsuspecting people? I probably would not stay again because of the wi-fi. 
2;What a lovely treat, its like a step back in time where service is second to none.  I was lucky enough to be in a suite which was amazing. The room was warm and cosy with home made choccies, grapes and shortbread. Initially there was no tea and coffee making facilities in the room, this was no problem & was rectified.  The best bit was breakfast in bed on sunday morning......................a rare and special treat.  Its not the cheapest hotel but evey girl needs a treat every now and then.................  Easy to get into York (Taxi £8)
2; We enjoyed our stay at The Inn on the Lake. It is quite a large hotel and we had previously stayed at the Borrowdale Hotel (sister hotel). This hotel is located on the banks of Ullswater Lake and the gardens fall into the lake with moorings and piers - stunning. The area around the hotel is fantastic with lots to do.  Upon arrival we realised this is a sought after wedding venue and can understand why. We appreciate weddings generate much needed income, but felt 3 in 3 days took over the hotel, therefore would not book another weekend stay due to this hotel being focused on large wedding parties. The bedroom was well presented, clean and the house keeping staff were extremely efficient, however our room was in the vicinity above the front entrance, so was noisy at night into the early hours - wedding guests departing for cheaper hotels (no doubt if you upgrade to the lake fronting rooms, these are away from the noisy areas). We chose this group of hotels because they are dog friendly. We stayed on bed, breakfast and evening meal basis and found the meals to be fine, however we did expect better, as we chose this hotel based on their food rating - food could have been hotter (we advised me this to restaurant staff - and this got rectified) and more flavoursome. We chose to eat in the Orangery on the last evening and this was excellent.  The group of hotels are constantly seeking to make improvements and we intend to return to one of this groups hotels next year. 
2; We stayed here at the end of December as we were attending a wedding reception at the hotel, all of our rooms were fine and clean but you could tell by minor things that the hotel was about to change hands. The prices in the bar were very high, but the breakfast on both mornings was excellent and the staff were very obliging in accommodating our requests This is a excellent venue for a wedding and the staff, service and food were very good throughout the reception and into the early hours of the morning 
2;Stayed here for 2 nights in May, on business trip in the area. Staff, restaurant and bar area all fantastic. In fact the meal we had in the restaurant was fantastic. My room was comfortable clean and quiet. I knocked off a star only because rooms are quite small - not a problem if like me it was only somewhere to sleep, but perhaps would have not been so keen to spend any length of time in it.
2; We stayed here in January 2015, a very cold couple of days, but our room was very warm when we entered it, always a welcoming sign. It was a ground floor room in an annexe, just yards from the main building, and the car was immediately outside. Plenty of hot water at all times, and a comfortable room. One thing that especially impressed me was the food in this hotel. Portions were very generous, and the evening meal offered a lot of choice, including a vegetarian option. And it was very tasty! The hotel is in the centre of Burford, one of the jewels in the crown of the Cotswolds. Only real downside was that the (free) wifi was very weak. 
2; We have stayed here many times before, and keep returning due to the location, atmosphere, and superb views. The service is excellent, and food is of very high standard. The only downside is the menu which repeats every few days, limiting the choice. That is the only reason I give it four stars instead of five.  We have witnessed various significant improvements over the years, but the latest change must be the modern sun-terrace. It is great for just a drink and looking at the view, or having lunch. A vast improvement of what was there before, and you can even be serenaded by the wind on the supporting steelwork ! (Almost musical)  Rooms are well furnished, and a slight problem with the windows in our room was dealt with efficiently.   Good access to Woolacombe beach, and a pleasant walk up to Mortehoe, albeit one for fit people, due to the steepness. Quick to get to the coastal path from the hotel.  The main restaurant gives stunning views. 
2; I stayed here for one night as a stop over and had a lot of fun in the bar which has a good vibe and friendly staff. Check-in can be done self-serve and they were very kind in lending me a phone charger and ordering a taxi to pick my fiancé up from Heathrow..   Bed was massive and comfy but room was tiny so would be a bit cramped if you were staying very long but great for a short stop.  Overall ticks boxes for comfort, cleanliness, friendliness and location, especially as it has an M&S opposite.. Yum. 
2; Great location, right on the tram line. Yes its a bit dated, and could do with a lick of paint, but its clean and everything works. The room was good. Breakfast was good, staff very friendly and helpful.  The pool is small. For a hotel this size, you'd expect a bigger pool, but it depends what you want from your stay in fabulous Blackpool. If you want somewhere reputable, clean and friendly, cant go much wrong that the Hilton. 
2; After a weekend trip at Hilton Blackpool,the hotel was great, food excellent, breakfast buffet excellent lots of choices but cleaning needs improving. I was in a family room and the insides of the bunk beds where unclean and the windows where filthy. But apart from that excellent hotel, staff and facilities would recommend and go again. 
2; My wife and I found Dormy House late on a Friday whilst we were looking for a weekend break from London the following day. We were clearly very lucky to get a room at such short notice and we were also very lucky to land upon Dormy House. It's a fantastic hotel in a beautiful setting. It manages to strike a nice balance between old world charm and a more modern boutique hotel. The restaurant is really very good and definitely worth checking out - as is the Spa which is fabulous. There's a good indoor pool and a plunge pool / jacuzzi outside as well. We were very lucky with the weather and spent most of Sunday lounging around on the sun terrace reading the papers - absolutely heaven. Our room was good too: a nice bathroom, huge bed, lots of mod-cons if just a little bit chintzy (but in no way bordering on bad taste). If you're looking for a really good bolt hole just outside of London then you could do far worse than Dormy House. 
2; I stayed here with my family (3 and 7 yo plus spouse) and enjoyed the stay. The hotel is obviously one of the old National properties and has the 70s look of these properties but the hotel has had money spend where it matters. The beds are very comfortable, the breakfast is great and the room layout (coffee machine, good desk, great towels and toiletries) were all up to standard.  Though the hallways and door frames looked straight from 1976, the room was clean, comfortable and well appointed.   Though this was a pleasant surprise, the real treat was how friendly and attentive the staff were. They really made my children feel welcome and were genuinely friendly.   Thank you for a great stay. 
2; Really convenient location, minutes from Chinatown, Deansgate, and the main business area. Around 10 minutes walk from Piccadilly station so great access. Friendly staff, good breakfast, recommended for a stop over. 
2; Booked as part of a combined parking (not parking at holiday inn) and hotel deal. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel was clean and quiet what more could you ask for a hotel stay. I knocked a star off on a minor detail in that the bar staff served a cup of tea with the tea bag on the side not in the hot water and then followed that up by pouring a whole Guinness in one. Train the bar staff properly in the minor details and this would get 5 stars. 
2; We booked The Royal for our Wedding Anniversary for two weekday nights, taking the ferry over from Lymington to Yarmouth (an eye-watering £80 car return pre-booked, which must inhibit some visitors to the IoW).  Nevertheless, despite this and some pot-holed main roads, we found our way to Ventnor and The Royal. What a lovely hotel although the website photos are slightly misleading because their is a lightly used road just outside the hotel frontage, which is not clear from the pictures. Our room (#9) did not have a direct sea view although others down the corridor e.g. #5 definitely did.  The staff were all helpful, friendly and in some cases, e.g. barman, quite knowledgeable about the food in the restaurant. The food was faultless, really good and we greatly appreciated a lovely touch at the end of our evening meal on the day of actual wedding anniversary which was a complete surprise.  Although it is now autumn, it was quite hot in our room even though the radiator was off, which was a bit of a puzzle. The shower was the easiest ever to use because it was a 'classic' Mira from well, maybe the 1950s. Anyway, it worked well which was the main thing. The sash window in this heritage building room were a bit clunky but only to be expected and functioned ok.  The bed was extremely comfortable indeed. There were a number of elderly guests and possibly some with hearing difficulties had their TV's blasting away but the walls were so thick that we barely heard them.   Outside the front of this grand hotel, I noticed what seemed to look suspiciously like damage from a machine-gun burst along the front wall, which may well be the case, as just a bit further down the road a blue plaque identifies a spot where another hotel had become 'a casualty of war'. NB. Ventnor hosted a radar station in WWII which the German Luftwaffe attempted to destroy at various times.  Ventnor itself is transitioning into a highly desirable place and one property on the beachfront, easily reached from The Royal is currently on the market for £1.5M. Incidentally, The Royal owns land opposite the hotel, seen in some of the website photos, which offers guests a place to relax with great views out along the coast and into the Channel.   All-in-all, The Royal is recommended and I hope we can return, especially if the ferry price over to the IoW comes down to more realistic levels. 
2;" Booked this hotel with 3 course meal and bed and breakfast for partners birthday through secret escapes. Upgraded to superior room when we got there. Bed was really big and comfortable. Staff were very friendly and helpful and gave my partner a lovely thoughtful present. The mussels and lamb I had were delicious and my partner really enjoyed his chicken dish. Breakfast was also very tasty and there was so much to choose from. Only advise I would give is if you go &quot;off menu&quot; check what it will cost you as I thought the cost of the meal I had booked was not taken off the total, but partner did not want to query it. Having said that I would stay again. "
2; The hotel was fabulous, we asked for a ground floor room, which we got but it was a good distance from reception,bar and restaurant.the room was very clean,nice bathroom, but a small Tv.we ate dinner in the bar which was excellent, so was breakfast,but lacking in staff both in bar and dining room, we had to wait till staff appeared.bed was very comfortable and lighting was good. 
2; Good, modern hotel in a great location - recent refurbishments have enhanced look and feel of the rooms. Good, efficient service and a bright atmosphere throughout, especially in the evening around the bar areas. Recommended. 
2; During the 2012 'Dancing On Ice' programme we stayed there for many weekends and everyone was so helpful. They couldn't do enough for us. Well done!! 
2; So to be clear, this is not a luxury hotel, but one of the better places to stay in Milton Keynes. If you hate budget brands and want somewhere functional but more comfortable, then the Hilton, Milton Keynes is a good choice. Having read the reviews I rang in advance to request a refurbished room which was nicely appointed, clean and with a very comfortable bed. Not quite designer or boutique luxury but above average and being recently refurbished not tired looking. Dinner in the hotel was again acceptable but nothing more. Breakfast on the other hand was good. At one time Hilton was a flagship brand and they have tried to move upmarket with their Doubletree hotels. However, they have as a result created a double standard for themselves. Staff were charming but stupid things like a tray charge of £5 for room service and serving tinned tomato soup suggest Hilton are pitching their range to a particular client group as opposed to offering one very high and consistent standard to suit the most discerning traveller. In this case it's a hotel to book your middle management and company guests you don't want to put in a dump but are not bothered to impress. Value - probably yes, but memorable no. However, if I was rebooked there again by my client I'd be happy enough as it does what it says on the tin, even if the soup comes out of one! 
2; We stayed 1 night at this London Docklands hotel flying out from London City Airport the following morning. Great Docklands location in the Thames waterfront and just 5 minute drive to the airport. Good spa facilities including a pool, parking and bar/ Restaraunt. 
2;" We secured a voyage price deal at The Green House hotel on Easter Sunday for a 1night dinner b&b with afternoon tea. We arrived at 4pm to a pre-booked tea of fresh home made scones and clotted cream, delicious. We had a small but very comfortable room on the second floor, only complaint was being opposite the lift so hearing the &quot;ping&quot; ever time the lift arrived was a pain, but didn't distract our sleep.  Room was very well equipped, lovely double bed with crisp white sheets, tea and coffee facilities, flat screen TV and a Bose iPod dock, nice touch was complimentary filtered still and sparkling water and biscuits. The bathroom was very clean and modern with a large walk in corner shower, no bath though, and plenty of lotions and potions. The hotel claims to be the greenest hotel in GB and may well be. They certainly pride themselves on sourcing sustainable materials in the refurbishment of the hotel and sustainable practices in the continued management, a very noble achievement. We ate a six course taster menu in the restaurant with a complimentary glass of prosecco, very tasty food and great presentation. Service a little off the mark but very pleasant staff. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment, having accepted that they provide breakfast until 10:30 we had a lie in and arrived at 10:10 only to find they had run out of most things and what they had was a little on the stingy side when it came to portions and quality, and unfortunately the staff appeared inadequately trained in customer service.  That aside none of these idiosyncrasies spoiled a very enjoyable stay and we would certainly return. "
2; Can only concur with all the positive comments about the Mint - stayed on Saturday night, booked in advance through LateRooms.com. £79 B&B, including the complimentary jug of Pimms, which we enjoyed in the Skylounge on the 13th floor. Room on the 3rd floor overloking the river - nice clean and airy with bathroom (shower) including all white accessories, including bathrobes. Location is excellent, 5 minutes walk from the railway station, so handy for everything in the city centre (bars, restaurants etc). Enjoyed breakfast with the deal (normally £15.95 !)  All in all, unbeatable for the price, considering it is a city centre site - will definately be returning !! 
2; Recently under new management Poets House is located in the centre of Ely amidst the medieval buildings and in sight of the Cathedral. In recent years it has been refurbished to a high standard - now matched by the prices - the rooms being comfortable and spacious. The staff are very helpful and trying to put the past behind them. The restaurant is good and will improve. The only down side, and the reason for 4 not 5 stars is the absence of a car park within a reasonable distance of the hotel. 
2; We stayed here with friends after returning from holiday via Birmingham airport and although we were in the hotel for only short time it was a lovely stay and definitely a hotel we will use again. It is an easy drive from the airport and the NEC and makes a refreshing change for the normal chain type hotels one gets near the airport. We had a deluxe room and it was excellent, very clean and very comfortable. We arrived fairly late and decided to have a bar meal in the restaurant. For me the food was disappointing, gammon steak overcooked, a few expensive chips, altogether overpriced and not satisfying. Breakfast was better - individually cooked and they cater well for anyone who is on a gluten free diet. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. We did not use the spa facilities but they looked to be excellent with a medium sized swimming pool and what appeared to be an excellent fitness suite. 
2;My date and I visited this hotel for a tea&coffee. It is a lovely and grand hotel with Doormen a Concierge Desk and lovely staff. Especially the female receptionist, and the two Bar Waitresses. I paid for a tea for myself and a coffee for my date. I found it surprising that they give and did give 2-3 refills of my tea.   I also asked if they had any available paracetamol for me, they did. The waitress went and checked with reception to see if they did. They did, but they couldn't supply it. which I understand. But I think she even asked if she could go out and get some for me. But she couldn't. She even supplied me with an extra tea bag, just in case I was a resident of the hotel. So when I left the hotel I gave them £3 to split between them. As I know from my own job, it's nice when you get a tip.   Thank you for a lovely atmosphere.
2; Stayed in a king room and it was very nice, clean and the bed was very comfortable, however the price for the night I stayed (a Saturday) was very expensive. I know it is a Hilton but the price was definitely excessive for what you actually get for that money. I would say the room was excellent and could not fault it !  
2;A stunning new hotel in an iconic building. The staff all young and enthusiastic make you feel welcome as you step through the door. The room we had was large and nicely appointed the bathroom also big and had every facility. As it is so new the young staff do need some more training as they can be a bit raw around the edges. We had a turkey meal in the restaurant which left a little to be desired. The turkey was cut thin and looked as if it was ironed and it tasted like cardboard. Certainly not fresh. We complained to the young manager Jack Tomlin who was excellent. He took our complaint and proceeded to make us feel better with the attention he took in trying to solve the problem. He was a great find as he spent time and took us around the hotel and showed us all the splendid parts of the building. He was so enthusiastic about the place and new all the history of the building that he got us enthused as well.. He was so friendly to us during our stay that we wanted to mention him and his great PR abilities. We ate in the restaurant the following evening and everything was just great. The pool and spa should be mentioned as it was a cut above many others. A good hotel and with some more training for the enthusiastic young staff this could become a great find. 
2; The hotel is excellently placed for easy walking distance to the central areas of London. The room was large and very clean. Having shutters on the windows reduced daylight and helped reduce noise (as the Strand is so busy!). Although there was tea and coffee in the room, it would have been nice to have fuit teas and hot chocolate as well. The staff were all very helpful, friendly and polite. The only issue we encountered was that 1 of the lifts was out of order and this caused some inconvenience to the guests having to wait. I would certainly be happy to stay here again. 
2; Anniversary 2 night stay whilst in London we chose here as we had tickets for a concert at RAH & having checked it out on TripAdvisor. Was very impressed with the entrance less so with the choice of hip hop music to greet us in reception The girl on reception could of done with some assistance, I felt sorry for the women who was still on hold when we got in the lift to our room. Our room was a superior & we were both very happy with it I was also particularly pleased with the complimentary bottle of wine & box of chocolates to greet us, thank you There are renovation works still on going at the time of our stay but we didn't find them a problem. We would definitely stay here again 
2;"Stayed in room 109 which was excellent facing the street with 3 steps down to a lovely bathroom. So the room was large and comfortable. The Malmaison chain are always a little dark I guess it is their thing it would be nice to get more light in the room without opening the curtains...but that aside for the £85 I paid for a Saturday night without breakfast you couldn't get a better deal. Duvet and bedding were of top quality as were bathroom products. Staff at receptions were excellent and the morning maids all said &quot;Good morning sir&quot; enthusiastically as I passed them on the way up and down almost as if they meant it ;-). Location just a few steps from the station exit and a short 130m stroll to the centre of town. I will use this as my go to hotel for future trips to Reading...well done to everyone at Malmaison."
2; Good for a base for Henley and Oxford.Room good clean comfortable but cold. Restaurant could do a bit of a make up seats with cow hide a bit no no.Steaks very good .If you go to Oxford the open top site seeing bus over price and wasted of time buy a cheap book on Oxford for 3,50 not 25,00 for the bus 
2; We went for the soul weekender, ourselves and 10 others, asked for 3 silver apts close to one another and thats what we got. Apts were small,(upgraded bronze apts really),but where o.k. We had a two bedroom apt, a double and a twin. We drew the short straw and had the twin, the beds were very narrow, however they were clean and the apt had everything you would need for three days,and nearer the venue, so not so far to walk,bonus!!! Have been going to this weekender for years, and have never missed one.. The music, the d.j.s, the people, are all great. Must be one of the best soul weekenders on the calender(Thanks to Dave and Donna)!!!!! The David Guest legends of soul was excellent, but to be honest we go for the music in crazy horses, and a dance, you cant beat it!!!!!!!! So untill next year K.T.F. 
2; Nice hotel located 5 minutes walk from Angel tube station and near lots of shops and restaurants. Room was modern and clean with a large comfy bed. Full buffet breakfast was £10 each and I felt this was good value.  The only downer was the 10% service charge at the bar. Whilst I can understand this for waiter service, I think think it is a bit rich for a UK hotel to add this sort of mark up when I have waited at the bar to order my drinks and taken them back to my table. This is the reason that I did not give this hotel a 5/5 rating. 
2; Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Fike Lakes resort on the 8/9 October for a Golf Weekend. After reading some of the reviews, we did go there with a bit of trepidation but couldn't have been more surprised. In our experience we could not find any fault with the whole weekend.  We played the Lakes course on the Saturday and throughly enjoyed the course and were bit dubious about the Links course due to things we have heard and some of the reviews but we found there was not a problem with it at all. OK it is not as nice the the Lakes course but it is fine.  The rooms were lovely. We had a buffet meal in the evening and that was really nice, just what we wanted. A jug of beer on the table was also a nice touch to greet us at the table. We then went to the bar for the rest of the evening/morning and had heard the drinks were expensive but we spent not much more in there than we would normally spend in a night at the pub. The breakfast was also very nice.  The staff that we come across were all friendly and helpful.  All in all, we had a really enjoyable stay and would not hesitate in going back there whether it be for a golf weekend or for a stay with our wives for golf and spa. 
2; Stayed on a two day Travelzoo offer, friendly welcome, room overlooking the golf course was good with a large comfortable bed. Restaurant lacked ambiance in spite of being very busy, young staff were enthusiastic and very pleasant, food was good without being exceptional. Golf course was in good condition and not over challenging. Would revisit. 
2;"We spent one night at this lovely grade 2 listed 17th Century country house hotel, with parts dating back to 1588. By its very nature, one knows that such a building will have lots of character and quirky features that a large hotel chain with their modern rooms will not/cannot provide. The public rooms are full of Georgian charm and very much as seen on their web site. I believe that the hotel was desperately struggling last year and allegedly went into receivership, but thankfully is now under new management since December 2014. If this is the case, then it is understandable that certain areas are now looking a little tired and in need of redecoration and general maintenance, which, judging by the Manager's responses to other reports, is what they are now addressing. Like any business, cash flow is key, so hopefully their programme of improvements will slowly be evidenced by the water stained ceilings and the odd patch of wallpaper hanging off the wall (particularly the restaurant) being refurbished.  As part of a group staying at the hotel, I was able to get to see rooms 1 (a massive room with 4 poster), Room 3 (a tastefully modernised (large) standard room) and room 9 (a very large superior room) in addition to our room - room 11. All rooms are nicely furnished with lots of period furniture (adding to their charm and appeal) the en-suites in all these rooms are nicely equipped and (with the exception of room 11) really spacious. Sadly for us, although room 11 is also nicely furnished, it is a considerably smaller room than room 3 costing the same price. Understandably, being a grade 2, 17th century property, rooms are all shapes and sizes adding to the charm. However, had I previously stayed at The Shelleys in room 3 and returned for another stay, I would be greatly disappointed on seeing room 11 (particularly, as was our case, not being able to swap due to full occupancy). In addition, as reported by another visitor, the toilet window can be viewed from other windows further along the corridor, resulting in the roller blind needing to be used to achieve privacy. Another down side to this room (if you are a light sleeper like me) is the noisy extractor fan from the kitchen, which thankfully gets switched off when the kitchen is closed up at night. However, there is still an annoying hum emanating from the lower floor which also sounds like an extractor and kept going all night. There is also a door somewhere directly below that needs the fire closer mechanism adjusting to stop it crashing closed!   Our biggest disappointment was the restaurant evening meal. The Shelley's web site states: The Shelleys offers discreet service, with high standards, within a uniquely calm ambience, with friendly staff who anticipate your every need. Sadly the last part of this statement: anticipate your every need, cannot be further from the truth due entirely to the inability of the majority of the 'waiting on' staff to understand basic English. The time taken to serve the main course in particular was excruciatingly slow, resulting in those being served first needing to commence eating before we had all been served. The chef and waiters clearly lack the input and guidance of an experienced 'maître d'hôtel' who would undoubtedly address these issues. Our final debacle was the 1 hour it took at the end of the meal for our individual bills to be dealt with; they came out 1 or 2 at a time, followed by the waiter disappearing again for about 10 minutes. It was only after the meal when we joined the other guests for the evening party that we realised the same staff were also serving drinks at the bar!  When booking out the next morning I asked if there were any customer feed-back forms, but was advised there weren't any; hence this report being my feed-back to the management In sum, a charming country house with a lovely ambience, but sadly let down by non-English speaking staff in the restaurant for whom it must also be highly frustrating to not understand what they are being asked."
2; Just celebrated a birthday with two nights at this hotel in a room with the largest bed we have ever slept in! The heating in the room was temperamental or not working at all, but the room itself was just fine and when we left we were told the plumbers were just waiting for our departure to go and sort out the heating, and and our bill was adjusted in compensation without our even asking. The staff were delightful, friendly, welcoming and helpful, and the breakfast was great. As for the location - perfect!! 
2; My partner and I stayed at The Oxford for 1 night during the bank holiday weekend. We arrived just before check in and staff were happy for us to check in early. The staff were very helpful letting us know about all facilities and were nearest bus stop is etc.   Def stay here again   Bonus - plenty of parking :-) 
2; My wife and I have stayed here many times before in a variety of rooms. On this occasion, the only real problem was that the bathroom was far too cold with no means of heating it. The service and food were as good as ever though. Definitely recommended. 
2; We spent two nights at the Daresbury Park Hotel , while we were in the area to see the 3 Cunard Queens in Liverpool.  Initially we thought the hotel would be a bit far out of the city, but little did we realise the problems with traffic and the extent of the road congestion too. So it was fortunate that we were in Daresbury, half an hour or so away from the city.  The visit to Liverpool was one we will never forget . It was truly amazing seeing these three large ocean liners so close up and so close together  The Daresbury Park is an excellent hotel, has a large car park and is out of the way of loud passing traffic. The restaurant is very good . It provides a self service sort of dinner with large bowls for piping hot soup . The main course is a carvery with several different sorts of meat and loads of vegetables of many kinds. The sweets are varied too, with both cold and hot available. Tea/coffee was available in a different room where there was also a bar which had entertainment on both of the nights we stayed in the hotel.  Breakfast had a wide choice of hot and cold food, with servers behind the serving area to help when/if required.  There is a good swimming pool and steam room and Jacuzzi as well as a gym.  We were fortunate in that our room was coincidentally next to the leisure complex The room was comfortable and clean , with both bath and shower. There was free wifi throughout 
2; We attended a Christmas party on 22nd December. The atmosphere was brilliant, the band were entertaining and got everyone in the spirit. Food was superb and all dealings with staff from reception through to the restaurant and bar staff was great. Nothing was too much trouble. I'm glad we didn't let the adverse weather conditions put us off, once there we were not disappointed. The bedrooms were warm, comfortable and clean. Breakfast was hot and in abundance. Well done - we'll definitely come back next year.... 
2; great rooms, fantastic breakfast service, slightly lower quality evening food and cocktails than I expected from a hotel that was otherwise outstanding. The wedding I attended was well managed, ran smoothly and was accommodating of our party size 
2; We stayed here 1 night over August Bank holiday. The room was pretty large, with sofa, desk & table etc. The bathroom was also a decent size, with a bath. We ate at the hotel on the Saturday night, we were offered the standard 3 course meal (£22.95) with a choice of options. For £23.00 the meal is fairly average, with 5 choices on starter, main & dessert.  There are cheaper options, if you only want 2 courses or less. The hotel is pretty large, with function rooms & a seperate bar. The setting does make up for soem things, it's situated right alonside the Thames, with views from the veranda down to the river & a large garden/grass area. 
2;"Call me old fashioned, but I do like to tell the truth! The Harbour is a seriously nice old hotel that's been given a stylish 'boutique' makeover.   A spectacular elevated position above Porthminster beach so some great views from inside the hotel, the spa and from the huge sun deck.  Decent food, a relaxed atmosphere and the staff are friendly and attentive. So we can certainly recommend it!   But. . . why in 2015, are all dog owners still treated like second class guests by most UK hotel owners? We regularly travel all over France without any problems only then to visit dear little St Ives and be designated a pokey 'cell' on the 3rd floor and be told that our beloved Bischon Frieze is &quot;barred from all public rooms&quot;! Woof Woof !!"
2; Booked this hotel for a one night stay with 4 days parking pre a trip overseas. Its big attraction was the closeness to the airport (transfers to and from the airport terminals included) and on-site parking. We arrived late the night before our flight, so had already eaten, so did not sample the evening meal menu, however, breakfast was excellent. The following morning, transfer completed easily to the airport for our flight. On arrival back, using a courtesy phone made the pick up simple, and we were in our car on on our way home in a short space of time. We had selected a Superior Double Room, which was very comfortable and meant we got a good night's sleep. I would definitely use this hotel again 
2; As a retired couple my wife and I opted to spend our second consecutive Christmas away from home. This year we selected the 3 night Festive package offered by Ox Pasture Hall, close to Scarborough. We were not disappointed. The Hotel sits in an ideal location within it's own grounds and has many manicured sitting areas which will be ideal for those considering a quiet retreat during the summer months.  The Hotel provides impressive accommodation by way of a variety of rooms and our twin-bedded room was maintained to the highest standard throughout our stay and catered for our every need. Beds were comfortable and the Heating system was superb with piping hot water available at all times. Our package included 2 nights Dinner in a clean, pleasantly lit Restaurant and the choice available on all courses was excellent in both variation and quality. The Breakfast options were again more than adequate and any cooked breakfast was excellent. Throughout our stay the whole Staff were exceptional in their desire to serve and at all times carried out their duties with the minimum of fuss - and importantly, always with a smile.  The Ox Pasture is a friendly, pleasurable Hotel which goes out of it's way to achieve customer satisfaction and comes very close to reaching that goal. However,if I were to offer any advice on improving even further the excellent service on offer then I would ask them to perhaps consider the following suggestions for their Christmas Day presentation.  1) Extend or add to the seating areas close to the Bar as space and comfort were at a premium on Christmas Day. 2) Try to ensure that in busy times food is presented in a hot condition. Sadly,my main course Christmas meal was only lukewarm and the restaurant was so busy that it would perhaps have taken an age to get it re-heated. 3) Finally, could I suggest that in future Christmas packages then the Residential Guests are allocated to sit within the main area and not in a small 'backroom out of the way' as was my experience on Christmas Day.  In summary my Christmas package at Ox Pasture was most certainly value for money, all the staff, particularly Lynsey and Leonie,made our stay very pleasurable and I hope that in 2017 the Hotel will go from strength to strength - it certainly deserves to. 
2;this is a really nice hotel and location to explore Liverpool.it's handy for all the attractions the city has to offer.the rooms are very spacious with everything you need.if you can get a room on the front of the hotel you will have great views of the Mersey.the breakfasts a fabulous with a wide choice.
2;" Having read some bad reviews on T/A,we were a little apprehensive as we had already booked our weekend away here with Groupon, but we always have an open mind when it comes to a new &quot;hotel stay&quot; for us.On arrival we were pleasantly surprised by the décor of the reception area. The young man on reception was very friendly, efficient and made us feel welcome. Our room (No.64) was quite an eye opener with a large bathroom and over bath shower, spacious bedroom and (unexpectedly) a sitting room/ dressing area.The room is on the top floor and set into the roof. Having said, this did not deteriorate from its appeal, in fact the angled window added to it, with views of the Warwickshire skyline and (if you are tall enough) views over the surrounding area. Being at the back of the hotel, we found that it was very quiet also it is the only room on this short corridor by the lift. On the negative side, we noticed that there was no Fire /Emergency procedure information that we have come to expect in other hotels. Also there was no land line 'phone in the room, a trip to reception quickly resolved this although we did not use it as the mobile signal was very strong, as was the free wifi. We found our room excellent, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom clean and the whole room very smart and tidy (if not a little &quot;tired&quot;), but nothing to worry about. Downstairs, as mentioned before, the whole reception area is very pleasing to the eye and the mirrors add atmosphere to the area (you would have to visit to understand what I mean). The dining room leads off the reception area, it is very modern, well presented, the staff both breakfast and dinner always have a very pleasant and helpful manner. the food at dinner (during our stay) was three courses of a varied, tasty and well presented food. There was very little left on our plates at the end of every course. We are not great connoisseurs of wine but the choice was, for us, very adequate. Breakfast consisted of a good selection of buffet style cooked food as well as choice of cereals, toast and conserves with unlimited tea and coffee on demand All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend away at Honiley Court and will not hesitate to book there again.  Can I end by just thanking all the staff for helping to make our weekend so enjoyable. "
2; Stayed here for one night for work  Lovely stay. Room was huge, facilities in room were good e.g. Teas, coffees, flap jacks, iron, etc bedding was great too - lovely pillows!  Breakfast was nice too. Lovely selection of fruit - I think there was 6 different types of melon!!  I went for a run and when got back the reception provided sliced fruit and cold water - I wish someone did that for me after every run!!!!  Would stay here again 
2; We enjoyed an overnight stay at the Regency Hyatt in Birmingham and would say it was certainly on par with hotels within this market sector. It was ideally situated to access the Glitter Ball or Symphony Hall via a covered link bridge. The only disappointment was that the breakfast buffet was poor in terms of not being maintained adequately whereby the hot food was left to run down and the scraps allowed to become cold. 
2;This hotel is ideal if you want a short break in Lincoln. It is located by the Brayford Pool opposite the University at the end of the waterfront that now contains lots of bars and restaurants. The main shopping area is about five minutes away, and the historic Cathedral and Castle a short walk up the steep hill. It is a modern hotel so if you are looking for old world charm perhaps not what you are looking for, but if you want a comfortable hassle free stay its ideal. The room we stayed in was big and well equipped. The staff were friendly and very professional. The top floor restaurant has superb views of the Cathedral, we only had breakfast here, but it would make a special place for an evening meal. We stayed here over Christmas and found it very peaceful, its just possible that on a Saturday night when the students are back it might be less quiet. Only draw back was they seemed to charge a lot to park a car
2;" Despite living locally, we decided to stay over night having attended an evening dinner dance function last Saturday. We were impressed with the quality of accommodation which was spacious with good sound proofing; reception were a touch indifferent on check-in but very pleasant on check-out. The function itself, see food photos, the meal was very original and appropriate for a special occasion (see function room photo). Downside, for me, price for breakfast was excessive (& strangely varied in price as I saw 3 different prices - online, on arrival and if deciding on the morning) and we chose to avoid, so I can't give a view on breakfast in this hotel; a personal choice of course, but we had breakfast in the town a few minutes walk away for a fraction of the cost. "
2; What a pleasant experience!  I visited my wife's daughter, who is attending university in the city,  and finally we have something we agree on: this place is fantastic.  Great wine, great service, comfortable rooms, an all round winner. My only grumble is that my stay wasn't longer! 
2;" Stylish, attractive, relaxing room: quirky, interesting design and furnishings; very comfortable bed; good restaurant - interesting, well-prepared dishes; good selection of reasonably priced wines, inc by the carafe/glass, and good value. We had soft-shell crab burger with lime mayo - very tasty. "
2; A nice hotel with lots of charm. Rooms clean and basic but ok. Staff friendly and polite. Good location within walking distance from the station. Restaurant staff in the morning non existent then quite abrupt and rude. Breakfast standard with the normal offerings 
2; Very friendly and helpful staff. Room clean and spacious, food excellent. All in all a most enjoyable break. I would recommend this hotel to anybody who wishes to stay in this area. Use of the spa is a bonus 
2; A very good welcome from a freindly receptionish was a good start to a two day stay using this hotel as a base for a golfing break. All the hotel staff encountered were execeptionally freindly and helpfull. They have smallish car park close to the hotel which is usefull as it can be a busy place to park. My room had a small double but as i single occupancy this was no probelm but i could imagine the room being a little small for two.Bathroom was very clean and shower etc all worked well.The cooked breakfast was excellent . The only minor critism was coffee was via a machine and tea was not provided in a tea pot.  I had one evening meal which was good but nothing exceptional. Overall a good place as a base which i would use again. 
2;" I have been moved to write this review having read a comment that business travellers seldom comment. I am a frequent guest(?) at the hotel and recognise most of the comments made in reviews here. It's a great place with friendly, helpful and courteous staff who always seem to want to do their best. I'm not convinced that they are always able to do this because of the constraints imposed by the management.  There are certainly recurrent problems with the heating and hot water and this is both frustrating and uncomfortable. The rooms and equipment are getting pretty worn so there are many minor irritations. In general things seem to take a long time to get fixed.  For a modern hotel, the in-room entertainment is pre-historic. With most rivals offering a full Freeview service (and some providing Appple iMacs!) the absence of anything other than the main TV channels (and no Radio 3) is astonishing.  But finally the food. It isn't good - it's barely adequate and is very poor value for money. Whenever possible, I eat out in the many decent pubs that offer excellent food at great prices. When work demands, the in-room/bar menus are dreadful - small portions of poorly cooked food based around a preponderence of chips. What you get varies from week to week and two nights in is getting a bit much. Breakfast is generally good although watered down fruit juice and an excess of melon is tiring (almost as bad as queuing at the toaster). The lack of easily accessible 'continental' items (meats, cheeses) has only been explained buy a poor excuse that doesn't seem to apply in any other hotel I've stayed in. It all smacks of penny-pinching, I'm afraid which doesn't fit with the four-star aspirations.  Finallly, if you use the regular guest system (&quot;Jump the Q&quot;), remembver to make sure they've remembered to put your daily newspaper or alarm call on - it gets overlooked. "
2;The hotel itself is quite impressive, but you do not get to park your car for free. My room was situated in just the right place to pick up a lot of late night noise from others. Didn't get much sleep. Have stayed in a lot worse. The following night, I stayed in the nearby Marriott, which was much better and worth the extra.
2; A nice location for the Leicester area. The rooms are good and spacious. Breakfast is reasonable for a buffet meal. The Swimming pool is nice if you have the time, we spent several hours in the pool with a granddaughter. 
2; stayed for 2 nights in room no. 1 which is a large double. very clean and well presented with a modern wall mounted t.v., a setee and small table,and plenty of storage room. the bathroom is clean and modern with a lovely walk in shower. the bar is large for a hotel this size and the bar seating area is big too,with direct access to the large garden. Booking was on a B&B basis but we had our evening meals here as well, and all the food was lovely. I do not hesitate in recommending this hotel to everybody. 
2; I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The location was very central and so was excellent for all my needs. Rooms were clean and i will definitly be staying here again in the future. 
2; Rooms were clean comfortable and large with communicating door between the family rooms. Bathrooms were clean and to a good standard. Only criticism were the wasps around the terrace and gardens....this should be addressed! Great stay for the park and a success for the family. Recommended!  
2;" We had a room with a Thames view for 1 night and the view didn't disappoint! Of added interest was the helicopter pad adjacent to the hotel. Comfortable bed, excellent cleanliness. We had food at Lunch time at the restaraunt. The food was good and reasonably priced before gratuities were added. My only complaint is there are far too many gadgets in this hotel. There is a TV in the bathroom we turned on but took a few hours to turn it off and I still don't know how it worked. We also got locked out of our room because I put my room card in my pocket next to my mobile phone. Apparently it deactivates the card???? Be warned. I am not against gadgets but would appreciate a &quot;how to use &quot; guide rather than being expected to know EVERYTHING. "
2; We booked an executive room well worth the extra, spacious with very good beds, we have stayed here before and can say it is just as good as last time, reception very fast, took no time to book us in with a smile, breakfast excellent , with a good spread. Will stay again next time we fly out of Manchester. 
2; Just returned from 2 night stay at the Carlton. Reception and all staff were friendly and room was fabulous. I booked a single room but was upgraded to a large double. Room was clean and had everything I expected. Breakfast was served buffet style and was good. Drink prices in the bar were a little expensive at £4.35 a pint, but all hotels nearby charge similar. The hotel is approximately a 10 minute walk from the town centre and has an excellent position on the East cliff. I have stayed at many hotels in Bournemouth and will return to the Carlton. 
2;Stayed on Easter Sunday as part of a Golf Break. Firstly the golf courses are superb, the Huting is tougher than the Priestman but both are excellent courses and were in great condition considering the recent snow. The hotel itself has many bars and restaurants. My favourite was thw 19th hole which is a cocktail bar. Unlike most hotels each bar felt like its own area with own personality. We ate in both the Claret Jug and Hadrians Brasserie, both of which were of very high quality with excellent service. The prices in the bars are high but nothing too shocking for a hotel bar. The only downside, which isn't anything the hotel can do much about is that the mobile phone service for many providors is very poor with none or limited coverage.
2; My Son and his best man were booked into the hotel the night before the Wedding and found the place Excellent apart from a little Expensive to eat and drink .  Free Wi fi would not work at all even staff Failed on this.  My Wife and I met up with them there and we found the place neat Tidy and very clean Service from Staff very pleasant and friendly overall a good place to stay 
2; Cool & chic. Amazing, lighting, decor, stylish features and ambiance. lighting and PS4, pinball and pool really different. Great staff and service. Will be back for certain when I m next in Birmingham 
2;"The Hilton Newcastle Gateshead occupies a spectacular location high on the Gateshead bank of the River Tyne just alongside the Tyne Bridge. Get a room on this side of the hotel and you will enjoy glorious views of the city rising on the far side of the river. From here it is a short walk across the Swing Bridge to the foot of Grey Street and a walk up into the city along one of the finest Georgian streets in Britain. The Sage, Gateshead’s world-class concert hall, is five minutes’ walk away on this side, with the Baltic Arts Centre and the Millennium Bridge close by. The area is helpfully served by the Quayside Bus.  The hotel sets very high standards in almost all areas. It has a spacious reception area, leading to a bar and restaurant which offer an excellent menu and service. Downstairs there is a fine pool and spa, and up on Level 5, a well-run Executive Club. Throughout the hotel staff are lively, friendly, and skilled. Rooms are spacious - although bathrooms are somewhat small – and are pleasantly fitted out. But in our experience of a number of stays in 2009, each for a duration of some three or four days, there has been a constant and very strange drawback.   First, we think you will need to request feather pillows straightaway; the ones provided by default are, to be honest, like boulders. (We have heard the inside story on this problem). But at least this is something which can be rectified. Of greater concern is the regularly poor quality of the mattresses. In our own case they have never felt less than rather elderly and battered, even though we have been assured that they are regularly changed. Just sit on one to find out what we mean! We have discussed this with reception staff, housekeeping, the Deputy Manager, and have now left two survey forms drawing the Manager’s attention to what as regular visitors we see as a remarkable lapse in quality for Hilton, but we are having difficulty getting the message through (although we hear a refurb is planned). It is for us a truly bizarre drawback for such an otherwise wonderful hotel."
2; Arrived Saturday afternoon and was promptly checked in to room 216 'Deluxe room' which was second floor next to the lift. The room faced out the front of the main building and was large and spacious with nice décor, bathroom, big TV. Went down stairs for a quiet drink at the bar before dinner in 'Oscars' restaurant at 7pm. The atmosphere and décor of the restaurant was very nice and contemporary and had a cosy feeling. The food was very good and service was excellent, would highly recommend the Fillet steak which is aged 21 days and was superb. After a very nice meal we returned to our room for a quiet night watching TV. We must have fallen asleep whilst watching TV to be woken by kids playing out in the corridor shouting and running about and playing in the lift because the 'ring' of the lift could be constantly heard. Eventually I went to sleep, the room was warm and the very old windows had to be handled gently not to damage them to let some air in. I was then woken again at 3AM with only to be described as 'inconsiderate piss heads' in the corridor shouting and laughing as they staggered off to their rooms. It took till nearly 4am before I got back to sleep. Woke next morning after a poor nights sleep after being woken twice by kids and piss heads. The breakfast was very good, lots of choice and great tasty local produce which we really enjoyed. The hotel, food was great just a shame when the rest of the guests have no consideration for anyone trying to rest!. 
2; I have stayed in this hotel from time to time when visiting the Euston area on business, and have generally found it rather dingy and the rooms rather tired. This time I was delighted to find a room refurbished and stylishly modern with an excellent bathroom. The reception area has also been much improved. Breakfast was fine though not exceptional. I would not hesitate to stay again. 
2; The Highbullen is a charming hotel which we had the pleasure of staying in recently. Although the weather wasn't great I still managed a round of golf, the course is well kept and in good condition. The highlight of the stay was the 'Loft Suite' in which we stayed. This super modern suite offered space, luxury and a modern feel in this characterful hotel. The food was excellent and service to boot.. Can firmly recommend a stay.. 
2; I could not fault this hotel of I was going on a business trip. It had everything you need, the location was great and the food and service were excellent. I found that it lacked a bit of the character I look for when taking a trip for leisure and perhaps it is has too much of a corporate feel for such an occasion. 
2; Stayed here for one night before our flight. Although we live in Manchester we always like to stay in an airport hotel before a early morning check in. We stayed on the 6th floor overlooking the runway. The room seemed it needed a good refurb but we had a good nights sleep. The food was good but very expensive. We are going to stay here again on our next trip. 
2; Had a one night stay in this beautiful old classic hotel. The room was lovely with high ceilings and very comfortable king size bed. Very clean and breakfast was tasty. The staff were all wonderful, especially at the front desk and in Marlow's bar. Great location for entertainment, dining and the market. The only drawback was the parking lot. The payment machine was out of order so we paid at the front desk. The parking ticket is valid to get you out of the parking lot for 15 minutes. When we tried to exit, the card would not work so had to park again and get the ticket re-validated even though we well within the 15 minute window. 
2;An excellent hotel very centrally located near to Covent Garden and ideal for the theatre and many restaurants. Great value for a 4 star hotel. Service was excellent and staff courteous. Would highly recommend this hotel if visiting London.
2;We stayed while visiting family Our room on the first floor was lovely, clean and had everything we could have needed. Bathroom looks old and needs a refurb. Despite being on the side and near a main road it was quiet. Was amazed the aircon had been updated and worked The breakfast was great, everything you could have wanted , staff helpful and friendly
2; We stayed here for just one night when we were down in London for a Arctic Monkeys gig. The hotel is lovely and we were pleasantly surprised. The location of the hotel is also spot on and is even in walking distance to leicester square and 2 or 3 tube stops. Would definitely recommend and stay here again 
2; I stayed at the Copthorne in Slough last week for a business trip. When I booked I found the breakfast to be very expensive so did not book it. When I checked in I upgraded, for £10 and recieved free parking (£6) and free wifi (£5). The room was nice and spacious and had been refurbished, albeit on the cheap. The Gym was limited with a pungent smell, it needed a good clean. The pool was tiny and more like a plunge pool. The bar was nice enough although I didnt eat in the hotel that night. I suggest people try Yummies round the corner. The website advertised breakfast at £17 yet in the room it was advertised at £13. I chose neither and went to Tesco down the road. I would stay again and happily recommend it but I would not say it is 4 star.. 
2;Stayed here the end of May. Staff, food, and facilities were excellent. My only surprise was that the room furniture and decor was tired and the ironing board ready for the tip.   I will be back in a month's time and will see if another room is a little more pleasant.  
2; This hotel is lovely and comfy hotel. staff can't do enough for you right down to the Scottish guy at breakfast he was very polite explaining where everything was.  The hotel was central to the pubs clubs and Liverpool one shopping centre. About a 10 minute walk. James street railway station was just around the corner. Very enjoyable stay. 
2; Beatiful looking hotel in a beautiful setting. There are some lovely garden, immaculately kept.  The interior decor is a little tired, but then it is a very old building, and there is a modern block of apartments on site We had an upgrade to the main house, with a big-sized room and lots of window space Great breakfast followed by a 40 minute around the grounds. When there, check out the Hare, a gastro pub 10min walk away 
2; Stayed here a number of times and after a shaky start with some teething problems the hotel now offers great service and comfort. The parking can be a little hectic on a first come first served basis. Alto restaurant very nice if a little pricey. 
4; I would just like to say what a fantastic service Marks Tey hotel provided for a wedding we went to on Sun 1st May. Everything from the attention to detail (from the excellent front of house manager) to the impeccable service of the waiting staff this was just a fabulous experience. I had no expectation as I hadn't been to Marks Tey hotel before but in terms of value for money and the quality of service (plus immensely friendly atmosphere) you can't beat it. Well done guys!!! 
4;Everything you could wish for in an overnight stay: friendly staff, comfortable bed, great shower and tasty breakfast. We used the swimming pool and spa facilities, not many people there which was lucky as it's a small pool. There was a good choice of bar snacks, although we didn't have a meal, others appeared to be enjoying the food in the bar area.
4; We have used this hotel for over 30 years and during this time it has never failed to provide excellent food and accommodation. In a world of ever lowering standards of service in all areas, its a comfort to know there remains at least one bastion of top quality hospitality. A visit to the Marygreen is a good antidote to the faceless corporate owned chain outlet misery that is the modern hotel experience. And long may they continue to do so. 
4; Had a fantastic stay. The staff are exceptional and nothing is too much trouble. The food is faultless and a great choice. I would highly recommend it.  They have great entertainment nights as well.  Good selection of wine and beers. The gardens are well maintained and everything is clean  
4; Booked this hotel for something slightly different whilst enjoying a couple of days in Brighton Reviews were good and it certainly lived up to expectations. A very pleasant change from bland hotel properties, with a popular coffee bar on one side and a busy restaurant on the other, and in a great location for shopping and the sea front. Dinner in the restaurant was superb with a very interesting menu and great authentic Asian flavours, book in advance to guarantee a table. Room & corridor were decorated in pink Indian decor and the room had a nice atmospheric coloured lamp in the corner. Staff on the desk also very pleasant and let us have an early check-in. All round a wonderful couple of days, and as weather was so bad spent a lot of time in and around hotel. 
4; Decided to stay here after our son's wedding and we were not disappointed.   We in fact did not check into our room until after midnight, but the reception staff were extremely helpful and very accommodating and this also applied to the bar staff too, who looked after us very well throughout the rest of the night!!!  The room was extremely comfortable as were the beds and pillows. I always pack my pillow wherever I travel throughout the world, but it was not needed at this hotel. The shower room was also well laid out with nice little touches, with the toiletries.  The breakfast area was laid out in a very casual and relaxed way and here again the staff were extremely accommodating in putting tables together for a large party. The buffet style breakfast choice was more than adequate and the hot food was in fact hot with the egg yokes very acceptable, as against how eggs can end up after being cooked in advance, which is always a plus for me. The range of the food available was also very good ranging from the hot breakfast to nicely cut ham, smoked salmon, cheeses, pastries and fresh fruit for those wishing to have a continental style breakfast. And I did notice in the ice bucket was a bottle of fizz complete with champagne glasses laid out too, which is a nice touch. The staff in the breakfast room who were probably from Eastern Europe, were extremely hard working, very polite and could not do enough for us. They certainly deserve credit for the way they approached their duties and I can't wait to have breakfast there again.  The s 
4;" Stayed for a business trip last week.  The girls and guys in the restaurant are very polite and professional. Constantly asking if &quot;everything is okay&quot; etc. The food is very nice and large choice.  This is how a hotel should be run. "
4; I have had occasion to use this Hotel on at least three occasions. The Staff are friendly and helpful. I liked the breakfasts and the Bar seems to stay open as long as you like and you can relax here. It is often fully-booked which speaks for itself. It is an old building with a young and friendly Staff. 
4; Returned after 5 years to celebrate our wedding anniversary. By coincidence we were put in the same room. It was nice before but has been refurbished since and is better than before. Great views over Ullswater. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Evening meal was excellent, For an extra £5 we had our breakfast served in our room which we ate admiring the views. Hope to return again to celebrate in the future. 
4; Stayed here on a visit to Chester booking through secret escapes. Itw as top quality and good value, our executive room was perfect and finished to high standard with lovely en suite. The whole place was beautiful inside and also smelled nice , lots of antiques and paintings but also felt modern. Both Nelsons bar and the very ambient Ciro's Brasserie were excellent for food. Gym and pool area was great and my wife enjoyed a very nice spa treatment. Highly recommended to anyone staying in this area. 
4;Hambleton Hall remains one of the loveliest and most welcoming small hotels in the country, blessed with a beautiful location overlooking Rutland Water and a Michelin starred chef who consistently turns out exceptional food. The wine list is extensive, carefully chosen, and includes good wines in all price ranges, without large markups. Easily one of the best restaurants in the East of England
4; We were here May last year while racing at Carr Mill Dam and had a great stay as you will see by the review I left then, Well a year on and we are having another great stay I can honestly say this is one of the best Hotels we stay at throughout the Powerboat Racing season and we stay all over the country, Once again we have our two German Shepherds with us, And as last year all the staff are very helpful especially the girls on reception who can't do enough for you we are here for another day and can't wait until we return again next year  So thank you to all the staff for making our stay great  Norm Kent Limos 
4; The history of the building & grounds adds a certain comfort and romance to staying here..   I stayed in one of the master bedrooms, and it was perfect, huge luxurious rooms and bathrooms, never wanted to get out of bed.. But the grounds made me.  Taking a walk around the gardens and lake is beautiful.  I have to say the staff there are just ask good as the place, the chef catered for my allergies also which really added a personal value. Also to say I did enjoy the cocktails, which they happily catered for as I'm rather fussy in my cocktails..  All in all I loved everything cannot fault it.. I shall be there for the champagne evening. 
4; We recently spent 2 days on a Regional conference at The Red Lion in Cromer 17/7/12. The staff were 5 star and were genuinely eager to help and please. our rooms were exceptional and the service excellent. The restaraunt was fantastic and during our stay we sampled most of the menu during 2 lunches and one dinner, fantastically fresh produce and served fresh and in very good time, all meals were served together and were hot (10) people. I would have no hesitation in reccommending this hotel for a luxury weekend break at a very reasonable price, views of the pier and sea, Excellent thanks Jo 
4;" Had a wonderful stay, nice to not worry about cooking and cleaning at Christmas. Service was brilliant and everyone was friendly, aproachable and accomodating. Only down side was an 8:30 fire alarm, but that was handled really well with a ready supply of &quot;space Blankets&quot; to keep people warm. "
4; As other reviewers have noted, the staff here is fantastic.They are friendly, capable, and accomodating, and are this hotel's best attribute. The rooms are spacious and pristine, though cleanliness is probably to be expected in a new hotel. Many of the hotel's features are ones that you would expect from more expenseive hotels--large TVs, comortable beds, and well-functioning air conditioning. Even the restaurant was excellent. It is located in a quiet neighborhood but London's main attractions are easily accessible by public transport (2 train stations nearby). Of the seven hotels we stayed in on an extended European vacation, this was my favorite. At current rates, I couldn't imagine finding a better deal. 
4; I was stupid enough to leave my keys in the safe when I left but when I contacted the hotel Mirka Turancova made sure that they were recovered and courieried to me. It is great to see first class service in this day and age and is one of the key reasons I keep coming back to this hotel. 
4;After having to make a last minute decision to stay in Bracknell, I called the Hilton who advised they did have a few rooms available for that night - The staff on the phone advised the room type, cost and all options without adding any pressure to book.  When I arrived to the hotel the receptionist remembered my earlier call and offered me a free upgrade as there were plenty of rooms available.   I was situated in one of the newly refurbished deluxe plus rooms. The room as spacious and actually had an iron that worked and was clean! This is my pet hate in hotels...Irons that are old, non steam and dirty!   Breakfast is buffet style with a large selection, constantly refreshed and the restaurant has plenty of seating.   I'd certainly look at this hotel first before others in the area!
4; I was on a business trip and was very glad to find this hotel. It is tucked away but it is worth the journey. It had everything I needed, clean well equiped room, free wifi, swimming pool, good meal in the bar. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
4;" We were not residents of the Nent Hall Country House Hotel because we already had a booking for two nights at the nearby Lovelady Shield Hotel. We called in for an evening meal at the hotel after spending the day at Hexham and exploring the delightful countryside in Northumbria. We found that the car park was spacious and it was easy to park our vehicle in the process.  Our meals were substantial and delightful and served with a smile. We had good &quot;vibes&quot; soon after entering the place and the restaurant was certainly busy as we left the establishment. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The service was efficient without rushing diners.  The menu had a good choice of meals and our main courses and desserts represented good value for money. We would recommend the Nent Hall Country House Hotel for evening meals.  What more can travellers say? "
4; We went down to Manchester and again decided to stay at Crowne Plaza this is a great hotel friendly staff and meals are also very good and a plus is its only 5 minutes from the hotel to airport T1 and we have enjoyed our last visits 
4;Thoroughly enjoyed my weekend. Very cool rooms each unique and original with complementary drink and snacks which were a fantastic touch, great character, very friendly staff and a good selection of beers.
4; We stayed in this lovely hotel for two nights on 30th and 31st December 1015, and have to say that everything about it was just great.  From the welcoming reception, the waiting and bar staff to the management, there was just a lovely 'we cannot do enough for you' attitude, that it made you feel at home and relaxed.  We had dinner one night and breakfast on two days and the food and service was very good. We did not want to join the New Year dinner and dance so made our own arrangements, but even though our room was above the bar/dinning room, we were not really disturbed.  Well worth the cost and we will likely go again 
4; Stayed here with my girlfriend for an over night escape. Lovely hotel set far enough away from anywhere to be relaxing but only 15 minutes from Bicester village for shopping. Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff! Breakfast was only weak point although still very edible and for only £5 had it delivered to the room which was a real luxury!! Would highly recommend to friends and family and will most likely be returning in future, Bargain! 
4; We had a short break to celebrate a birthday at Moonfleet some 2 years ago and it was wonderful. So we decided that it would be good to repeat the experience for our 20th wedding anniversary. We were not dissapointed. Wonderful friendly service, fabulous food, fantastic location and glorious eclectic mix of devout and furnishings Definitely not your `corporate designed, homogeneous hotel. Love it 
4;Me my girlfriend and our dog sky stayed for a very enjoyable 2 night break last week in room 12,can't complain about anything at all,All staff friendly and couldn't do enough for us,breakfast and evening meals 1st class & a good selection of drinks at the bar at reasonable prices,room nice & not too small,would definitely recommend anyone to stay here and we will be back again
4; A really great experience for a London hotel. The room was spacious and well appointed, light and we had a corner room with 2 windows which made it airy and pleasant. The underground is a five minute walk and the bus a three minute walk. The buffet breakfast is adequate and all staff were pleasant and helpful. Would stay there again but make sure Chelsea are not playing at home if you are there a Saturday night! 
4;" This hotel provided everything we needed as a pre-flight stopover. We travelled via tube/bus, and it was easily accessible. Busses from the hotel run to the airport from 4 am, which is great if you have an early start.  Check in was a breeze; our room was on the ground floor and was well equipped and clean, though was showing some signs of wear and tear. Good sized TV with on demand movies (bit pricey at £11), as well as play station games. Wifi was also in all rooms, and they provide take away coffee cups for the morning - great idea! We had room service which was prompt, and the food was good.  Restaurant and bar were also pretty good for an airport hotel, didn't have breakfast as we left early. Staff helpful and a good lounge with pcs, would recommend - surely one of the better hotels by heathrow, and at £52 an absolute bargain! "
4;" This was the first time we had stayed in a serviced apartment instead of a hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience; we won't be going back to a hotel. In fact we have found the ideal place to stay in London so we don't even have to think where to stay any more. It is well located in terms of the museums and central London (and not too far from some of the outer London Attractions such as Kew Gardens) and yet situated on a quiet, pleasant road. The apartment was spacious, well supplied with everything you might possibly want , very clean and came with an outdoor area complete with table and chairs. Customer service is amazing - nothing is too much trouble. "
4; I booked this hotel after staying in a Novotel hotel in France many times. I was not disappointed at all! Great service from reception when we arrived, we had an executive room with loads of little extras. good size comfortable room and a great nights sleep. I will be returning when I next stay in London. 
4;We chose this from comments on TripAdviser and weren't disappointed. We were upgraded to a huge and splendid room with two sofas, looking out over the square. Despite being directly above the bar on a warm evening it was not noisy at all, and we slept well apart from loud thunderclap in the night! Staff really friendly and helpful, and breakfast set us up for the day. A bit of mould on some tiles in the large bathroom, but this was a minor point in an otherwise spotless place. Free parking and wifi both very handy, and only a short walk into town.
4;What should you expect from a hotel next to Buckingham Palace? Well, quite simply a hotel fit for a King or Queen. The Rubens hotel certainly didn't disappoint at any level - yes there is room for slight improvement but this was merely due to the fact that the rooms are beginning to look a little tired, but let's not forget this is a very old building with a great deal of history and it has a fantastic amount of charm.  Proudly owned by an independent hotelier, the staff are all very passionate about what they do and they cannot do enough to help, courteous and polite and always welcoming with a smile. We stayed for a long weekend while attending the garden party at Buckingham Palace, and although we arrived earlier than normal check in time, the receptionist did everything she could to get our room ready for us to check in early so we could change.  The Rubens also has several areas for a quiet drink and also a formal restaurant and less formal bar area for lighter bites, and if people watching is your thing then their Champagne bar is a must to sit and watch the many people passing heading to and from the Palace.  Overall a wonderful place to stay perfectly located for a stroll just about anywhere in the city, 15 mins walk to the London Eye, 15 mins Trafalgar Square, 15 mins Covent Garden etc, and with St James' Park on your doorstep too what more could you ask? If you are looking for a modern hotel then you may be in for a disappointment but if traditional and quaint is your thing then this ticks all the boxes.  Well done all and thank you for your hospitality.
4;" Every aspect of this hotel is superb. Large, well equiped (Samsung tablet, large TV, and high quality DAB radio included) and tastefully decorated rooms; modern, well equiped and stylish spa facilities including a reasonably sized pool and external secluded hot tub; comfortable and cosy lounges with open fires: excellent food that is fairly priced; friendly staff; easily accessible from A -roads but far away enough to be quiet, near to Broadway Tower with amazing views and close to other Cotswolds villages and towns. Will definately visit again. Thank you Dormy House Hotel for making our stay so special. "
4; Great rooms with a fantastic view London Eye. Very close to Big Ben. Facilities like the swimingpool and fitness center was very good. The children liked to take a swim after alot of walking during the days. 
4; Back at the Ramada for the Southport Air Show, not disappointed at all apart from the weather on Saturday but more than made up by the sun in Sunday great weekend,got the bedroom we wanted ,food very good and the service was very good, only critic is that it's a pity that at breakfast they staff don't serve the toast with the coffee or tea, far better than hanging around with a hot breakfast going cold why you have to fight a toaster 
4; Placed between the transport hubs of Euston, Kings Cross and St Pancras, this hotel is easy to get to and great for visiting the Southbank and the West End. The rooms are comfortable and, although some reviews complain about the cleaners, I have no complaints whatsoever, after 3 stays. Remy and his team at the bar serve up great cocktails and look after you well. The breakfast buffet is amply supplied. All in all, it is great value. 
4; We had my wife's 40th Birthday party this weekend at the Belfry. Chloe was excellent organising our event from start to finish and the rest of the team on the day were fantastic. We had 17 bedrooms booked and every one of our guests were very impressed with all aspects of the hotel. The young man Paval (I believe) who was on bar duty and then again the next morning running Breakfast was a class act and a real credit to the hotel. The young gentleman who looked after our event in the evening was very attentive and a really nice lad (works in the gym) and you can tell the hotel is completely focused on customer service. We received so many positive comments on the food, function, hotel and the staff and would certainly stay again in a heartbeat. Thank you all so much for making us and our guests feel so welcome and you genuinely have an amazing team to be proud of. 
4; This was my first time staying at an Amba hotel, I was extremely impressed with the customer service and friendliness of the staff. The rooms are of a high quality finish, a great hotel in the heart of London. 
4; So we got their, next day we had a flight. They had a problem with the reservation, after an hour they apologised and as they were booked they upgraded us to the presidential suite.   It was excellent, though we get the standard so I cant comment on it but the presidential suite was perfect. We had a complimentary breakfast, it was a buffet. It was very good. Free WiFi as well and it was good enough. It is also near Heathrow, it was a good place for relaxing before a 24 hour travel.  Now for the negatives, a drunk comes out and is like flirting with my wife, it was both funny and sort of pathetic. Please control the damn drunks. 
4; A lovely seafront location with a traditional and quality level of service. Charming rooms, restaurant and bar and at prices lower than some budget motorway hotels. Couldn't fault it in any way and a lovely City to spend a weekend. 
4; After reading previous reviews I expected my single room (11) to be small - and it was just that. However, it had everything I needed for a one night stay and the location close to the Albert Hall was great. Room at back of hotel and view of brick wall 10 feet or so away, but being at the back it was very quiet and I slept well with windows open and heard no outside noise. Bathroom small with VERY small shower cubicle. I imagine some people would have trouble getting in and closing door, although I just about managed to get in, shut the door and turn around. For the price, in Central London and a good position with good quality fitments in room, I don't think it can be bettered. 
4; We were delighted by the the service received at Hill Valley, it was attentive without being over the top. The staff were very friendly and efficient, breakfast time was a joy possibly some of the best service we have enjoyed. I would highly recommend this hotel, even if like us, you don't play golf. 
4;I took my son to the children's Easter party on bank holiday monday and we both has a great time. The entertainment that was provided was great fun all children of all ages seemed to enjoy the magic tricks and juggling. The way that the Easter Egg hunt was done I thought was brilliant, ensuring that all children went home with the same number of eggs, my son loved walking around the garden finding the chocolate eggs. The food that was provided was brilliant, plenty of finger food options for the children and great afternoon tea for adults. Was great to have such friendly and welcoming staff around, I am hoping that you will be arranging more family events again in the near future.
4; We booked through a spa break company for a special occasion. We were very happy with the room, service, food, location and spa. Could not fault the and the staff were really helpful and were able to meet any special requirements. 
4;Can't fault the place. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Clean room, good dining areas with top quality food. If your room is above the third floor the views are superb .Right next to the shopping area. Not too close to the station, but there is a frequent bus service (number 8 and 9), £5 in a taxi or if you don't mind a five minute walk through the park opposite, there is a ferry boat service??
4; Our hosts Jeff and Sandra were very friendly and Jeff showed us directions for the locality - very helpful. The room was comfortable including the bed and the bathroom was spacious and a very good easy to control shower. Breakfast had a lot to choose from with fruit, yogurt, lots of cerials and a excellent cooked breakfast by Sandra. Everthing was smooth running and relaxing. The bus stop is on the main road outside the hotel, so very convenient and also about a 15 minute walk to the promenade. We would definitely stay in this hotel again if in Torquay and highly recommend it. 
4; We decided to stay here as it was very central to go out and about and for the station, as we arrived by train! The rooms were very clean and the staff friendly, we were a group of 6 in 3 twins and as girls 'do' viewed all the rooms to see who had the best! None of us were disappointed and enjoyed the very varied breakfasts. Through out our first day we dropped our shopping off at reception and it was no trouble what so ever for the staff, they were only too pleased to have been of assistance. None of my friends had been to Shrewsbury before and all said they would revisit and definitely use The Prince Rupert again. 
4; My wife and I stayed at the Casterbridge for the night while visiting friends in Dorchester.  It is very close to the centre, had dedicated parking a block away, a comfortable airy room, and the best cooked breakfast I've had for a long time. Nice staff too.  The only slight minus was a slightly saggy bed (but a beautiful four poster).  Bravo. 
4; Had to visit a company in stamford. Found this hotel close by. Must say the hotel should pride themselves with excellent levels of customer services and excellent food. The hotel had option both formal and non formal settings. Very relaxable stay. Sometime it seemed I am staying at a King's Castle. 
4; The Oxfordshire Golf Club and Hotel offered an excellent peaceful and quality meeting venue in a great location. The setting and views from the bar and meeting rooms across Oxfordshire countryside are superb and this is backed up by attentive staff , great food and a venue that facilitated an excellent meeting venue choice. 
4; Despite drizzly weather my wife and I had a fantastic weekend. Tremendous hospitality from Syd Jenny and their team. The facilities, particularly the pool and gym were great, the food was wonderful and the entertainment first class. Thank you. This was our first visit but it won't be our last. 
4; The hotel was chosen for the following features:- Location, Good sized car park, Excellent leisure centre with good sized swimming pool, 2 gyms, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna & Jacuzzi.  The booking was easy and very clear, reception greeted us professionally by friendly and throughtout the stay we felt that the staff could not do enough for us. On arival we were given a map of Bournemouth and the receptionist was able to point out key locations that we wanted to visit.  The Buffet breakfast was excellent and set us up for the day with a comprehensive selection of hot and cold food.  Throughout the hotel there was free wireless broadband and in the room there was access via RJ45 sockets if you did not have woreless.  The rooms were well lit with good sized windows and a large comfortable bed. The flatscreen showed a good selection of Freeview channels.  The bathroom was fully tiled and decor was execllent. The water suuply was such that the bath filled very quickly and the toilet system refilled in a very short time. The over the bath shower also performed well.  After a day out we found the bar very welcoming and the prices reasonable.  We plan to vist again early next year 
4; Just stayed here on our way to the USA. Very good service at reception, went to our rooms and they look just like they do in the pictures. Clean, cosy and very comfortable beds. Got a great deal through Holiday Extras with 3 weeks parking, so can't go wrong. Tried out the bar and got a sandwich and fries with a beer, considering we were in London, not too pricey. Got the Hoppa bus to terminal in the morning which took just 20 minutes. Will stay here again when travelling. 
4; Great hotel.rooms small,very central for all theatre,close to underground stations.wine & cheese put on by hotel every afternoon.The staff were wonderful,nothing was two much trouble to make our stay fabulous.nice comfortable beds.Large TV.Thanks again for making our stay fabulous.Will stay here again next trip to London. 
4; Superlatives do not do this Hotel Justice  We stayed with friends for a wedding anniversary and enjoyed all the facilities.  The rooms were fabulous and the food completely faultless and superb, as was the service.  We look forward to our next stay.   Thank you to all the staff. 
4; I recently had the pleasure of taking my partner to this wonderful hotel for a one night break and have to say this experience from beginning to end was AMAZING. All the staff are friendly, professional and very knowledgeable especially Marco in the restaurant. We will be back to Rushton Hall very soon. Thank you all so much for a truly wonderful experience. 
4;A great hotel we had a problem with the iron in the suite but it was sorted out straight away. The staff were very helpful and polite throughout our stay catering to every need we had. the room and hotel in general was very clean throughout and the bar had a great selection of whiskies. A great stay and was very relaxing and we would happily stay there again on our next visit.
4; Stayed here several times and never disappoints. Beautiful spacious room finished in a fantastic modern style. Has everything you need and more. Staff always tentative and friendly, more than happy to hell with anything, Good continental breakfast offering with options for hot breakfasts available. So well located with bus stops outside to Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square and so on as well as Euston Bus Station and Euston, Kings Cross and St Pancras tube stations a stones throw away. Also a 30 min walk from London Zoo. Brilliant hidden gem of a hotel! 
4; We had an excellent Business Conference during the day at Rudding Park in glorious grounds and a wonderful building all of which was fully supported by a fantastic lunch and tea and coffee services during the breaks.   However as always, you may have been overwhelmed with the oppulence and setting for this meeting during the day but you can't help getting that special buzz when you enter your room for the evening. To top it all the service received has never been matched from anywhere else where I have stayed.   Its a real pleasure to stay at Rudding Park and the team who work there make it so. Its a credit to them all. 
4; Had a very nice stay here in December 2014. On arrival we were given a free upgrade to a suite. The furnishings were slightly tired, but very clean and nicely presented.   Hotel itself is lovely and staff very friendly. Within walking distance of Westminster and the London eye. Some rooms have a view of Big Ben which is a bonus. Highly recommended. 
4; Bristol has many four star hotels offering great weekend online deals. This is the best for me, superb location five minutes from Temple Meads Railway Station, close to a good Italian restaurant. main shopping area is 10 minutes walk. Large well equipped superior rooms and the ultimate cooked breakfast. Under hotel car parking with lift access. Orange wi fi at 1.5 euro, will soon be upgraded. 
4;All I can say is wow, fantastic, brilliant, that's right great service and fantastic food...we arrived here about 2pm on a very wet Saturday after getting soaked at Manchester Central comic con exhibition. ..we were welcomed with a very warm receptionist who immediatly saw to our needs an offered us a free upgrade to an executive suite, which we gladly accepted, however as check in time is 3 our room was not quite ready but our daughters room was so we all went to her room to chill out and dry off, then back downstairs to the bar area where we ordered some lunch, I had a minute steak and fries which at £12.50 thought was a little expensive but when it arrived it was to die for about an inch thick and cooked to perfection and the fries were just as I like them fresh and crispy...nothing in this hotel was left to chance, needed some extra teabags no problem...they also have a lot of pulling power at some of Manchester ' hard to get into restaurants, they got us on the priority list at the Hard Rock Cafe in the print works Manchester City centre and voila we got in at 7.30pm without having to queue at all, all I can say is this hotel is highly recommended and would definatly come back here again...great value for money an executive room with full English breakfast for £85.00 FOR 2 PEOPLE..we also used their car park which is situated just behind the hotel and is extremely secure but if there is a downside to this hotel it's their price for parking of £20.00 for 24 hours....Other than that faultless.
4; I first went to the Park Plaza when it initially opened, and couldn't have faulted it in any way. I have recommended this hotel to numerous people and as it was our 25th wedding anniversary, my husband and I decided to go to London for a long weekend.  I had raved about the hotel, and it's great location as he wasn't with me on my first visit so wanted to see what is was like.  On our arrival we were told that we had been upgraded, which as lovely has this meant we had a small lounge area with sofa, etc. The standards though are just as good as the normal room. The bed is great (hubby can suffer with his back sometimes but he had no problems). The linen, towels and shower are wonderful. The location is brilliant as just minutes away from the London Eye and things along the river bank. Just how far you stroll is down to you, we walked to the Globe theatre, across the river and then back round and over Westminster Brigde.  Don't be put off by the hotel being on a main road, the sound insulation is superb.  On any subsequent visit to London, this hotel will be my first choice! 
4;We booked this hotel for a 50th birthday treat. The room was a junior suite and was fantastic. Lovely and spacious with excellent amenities. What made this extra special was the attention to detail that the hotel offered. When we informed the hotel that this was a special 50th celebration, they were fantastic in offering a bottle of champagne, birthday cake treat and card signed by the team. This was a lovely surprise for my husband and made us feel special.  The location was great for visits to central London and theatre land. We were minutes away from Oxford street shops and Marble Arch tube station made this a perfect location.  Well done Radisson Blu Portman Hotel and thanks for making this a special weekend.
4; It's easy to get bored with business hotels - they all start to blend in each other when you travel a lot. It's really nice to find somewhere a little different - Really nice room, shower was more than a dribble and the free soft drinks and snacks in the mini bar is a nice touch.  Price is very good for London and extremely handy if your business is in the city. It's only a short walk to the Tower as well if you are doing the tourist thing. Aldgate Tube station a stone's throw and the most reasonably priced car park in the whole of London. Good selection of restaurants and bars close by. Would certainly revisit when back in town. 
4;" I booked this rather last minute, and decided to give it a go because of the attractive rate of £85 per night. I was initially worried how it would be (too cheap to be nice?) but in fact it was absolutely fine for what we needed....  The reception at this hotel doubles as the counter of the lobby cafe - and in fact it feels a LOT more like a cafe than a reception area. They also do standard cafe / deli drinks and snacks.   Although you can't check-in until 15:00, it was no problem to leave our bags in their luggage room while we went off to explore London. When we *did* get to our room, we found as expected that it was absolutely tiny, but (to our relief) it was spotlessly clean, and it included everything we needed.   I did a little work in the cafe downstairs while my wife slept, and I was amazed by how good the early evening complimentary wine and cheese were - good choice of cheese and decent wine - and no charge of any kind! I was going on to dinner, so I deliberately limited myself, but if I had been on a business trip I'm sure it could have done me for my evening meal. I have stayed in a lot of expensive places (for work) but none were so generous with their free food and drink, and the waiter service for drink happily avoided any guests &quot;over doing it&quot; due to free drink!  Overall, I was really happy with the &quot;small room = small price&quot; deal here. The tiny room would be beyond luxury on a plane, and better than I've experienced on cross-channel ferries. For a short stay, or for a cheap stay on your own, this could be a very good base.   Final thought: prices do seem to vary airline style i.e. the same room could cost more than double what I paid, later in the week. I am sure I would not be so happy with this hotel if I had to pay e.g. £180 a night, but if the rate is £80-120 I would happily stay here again "
4; Great hotel. Would definitely stay here again. Very comfy room, clean, spacious, stylish and nice view. Good cocktails in SkyLounge. 
4; This was almost certainly the best pub-meal of the hundreds we have had in over 45 years, and well ahead of most of the restaurants too.  Our party of four had lamb shank, beef stroganoff, crayfish & avocado risotto and salmon steak, followed by chocolate brownies (shared), cheesecake, and fruit pie and ice cream. My risotto was superlative, but the other three adults were equally complimentary, and my wife's stroganoff, as well as being delicious, was enormous. The staff were welcoming, cheerful and efficient, and (on a busy evening) our main courses arrived at the table only 20 minutes after ordering. Altogether a very impressive experience. 
4; Had a night there following a Christmas function / Conference. Very helpful staff, great place and food was wonderful. I would recommend this place to anyone, If we travel to Leeds in the near future we will be booking here. 
4; I booked this hotel to celebrate a Birthday however due to a mix up the Ala carte menu was unavailable.They phoned me to tell me this on the day.I was initially disappointed but they offered me a free buffet and a free bottle of wine as compensation,The food was good and they gave us a lovely room overlooking the sea. 
4; A great and peaceful hotel, in perfect surroundings near the canals and docks. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Nearby restaurants and bars offered fantastic entertainment for the evening and the breakfast was a perfect hangover cure. We will likely be staying again. 
4; Really good stay and a super location. Staff excellent and vert attentive. Room was very well appointed, clean, comfortable and quiet. Sunrise over the bay was a delight. The restaurant was very good and food well presented and tasty with a good selection. All in all an excellent stay and good value. 
4; Recently stayed here for my girlfriends birthday. After quite a lot of hotel searching, i decided to go with Malmaison and was more than pleased with my choice. From check in to check out, it was perfect. Started with being upgraded to the Romeo and Juliet suite which was amazing and very much appreciated ! Then we had our evening meal in the restaurant, which was fantastic with more nice birthday touches from the staff. The morning after we arrived downstairs 20 minutes late for breakfast, but they were still more than happy to cook for us and the full english really was delicious, glad i didn't miss out! Everything from the room, the staff, the food and the hotel in general was just brilliant. Thank you to everyone at Malmaison for a fantastic stay and making my girlfriend very happy on her birthday, we was well and truly spoiled! Will definitely be returning in the future and 100 % recommend this hotel, specially the date night offer. Great value. 
4;Just returned from a 2 night stay here. Staff are outstanding. Welcome from Reception is just excellent. Second time stayed here now - and with the free parking at the front of the hotel, I would not consider anywhere else in London for a short break. Rooms really have everything. Nothing to improve - well done. And thank you.
4; Everything about our recent stay with you was exactly as one would expect from a hotel of your standing. Restaurant staff and food excellent. Rooms and service as always exceptional. Golf course in pristine condition and very welcoming. Thank you all very much, we will be back again soon. 
4; Came here for dinner on Christmas Day and I can honestly say it was the best Christmas dinner we have had. Each course was immaculately presented and was simply exquisite . What really made this day was the service, it was so fast and every member of staff was so helpful and cheerful. The atmosphere was brilliant and all of our party really enjoyed it. 
4; Just got back from a short stay at this hotel, £134 for 2 nights, breakfast included and a meal on one of the nights for 2 people. I am a first time reviewer but feel that I should review this hotel as we found it excellent value. The bar area is nice and the food was good too. The staff were really friendly but a special mention must go to the Ops Manager Mr Alahakom (or something like that, sincere apologies if I have got that wrong), who looked after us impeccably. He is a really nice guy. All in all a very enjoyable stay and we would not think twice about revisiting in the future. 
4; Had another lovely stay at the Holiday Inn, Harrogate. After the free upgrade, which was totally unexpected, we had a lovely executive room with a glorious view on the 9th floor. We have stayed at the hotel a few times now and always find the staff excellent and the service the same. Clean and comfortable hotel which is a only 5 mins walk from the Hotel. Happy to go back again sometime. 
4; The stay was outstanding. The service was fantastic with every query being answered, this includes food service in the sealevel restaurant. The room was immaculate and the sleep quality was amazing. The bed was comfortable and there was no outside noise to disturb us sleeping. I would highly recommed the Marriott hotel due to the fact that it is perfectly placed for access in and around Portsmouth. We enjoyed every moment. 
4; A very comfortable experience made special by the warm and friendly staff - incredibly committed and attentive making the whole experience a special one! I look forward to returning very soon. Babs and Hannah made a great impression, looking like they loved to be at work. 
4; Stayed only for one night. Our first room unfortunately had been decorated and still smelled of gloss paint. Reception moved us to another room immediately. The room was spacious and comfortable. It had a lovely view of the bay. The bathroom was huge and well fitted. Breakfast was excellent. Will definitely stay again. 
4; We stayed here before our long haul holiday as we had an early flight, excellent position for quick access to the airport. Since we last stand (March 14) we were pleased to see that the corridors and rooms have been refurbished. Our room has comfy and clean, big bed and had a bath with shower, we had a great nights sleep. The hotel bar was good value and had a good selection of drinks. Likewise we ate in the restaurant, quality food and generous portions. Would definitely recommend this hotel. 
4; What a delight to stay in a hotel where the staff have pleasure in providing a brilliant service. From registration to departure the team demonstrated excellent customer care skills and quality service throughout. The room was well appointed, quiet, comfortable, we needed for nothing. The breakfasts were very good. The staff all smiling even when they weren't serving customers....they seemed pleased to be on duty...what a delight compared to many hotel breakfast teams that look tired and bored! Well done Supervisors for encouraging their teams.  The front of house staff did everything they could to provide us with first class service from phone charging to plugs to guidance on accessing the WiFi and directions to other places.  We strongly recommend this hotel for a good stay in central London.   Well done Team Doubletree Victoria!  
4; WOW this hotel really has put a smile on my face. My Wife and I have just spent a long weekend here for our first wedding anniversary and had just a perfect weekend.  We booked this hotel through 'Travel Zoo' and to be fair got a really good deal but you always have in the back of your mind that your going to get treated differently to the full paying customers. This was not the case, service was second to none! We had a standard room and it was excellent, huge plasma TV, huge and comfy double bed, huge bathroom, dressing table for the wife, fridge for the men (wink) and a dinning table under the window overlooking some beautiful views. Only bad thing i can possibly think of was the water pressure in the bathroom but it wasn't something to moan about. We had a 3 course meal in the evening which was spot on, very filling and tasteful. Breakfast in the morning was first class with plently to choose from hot and cold, couldn't ask for anything more! Oh and if you like Tea, go for the afternoon team for 2, you get a lot more than you expect! I just say anything bad about this hotel, i will certainly be going back and recommending to many. You wont be dissapionted!! 
4; Lovely Hotel, Great value. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. All were friendly and courteous. Excellent view from room over gardens. Food was well prepared. Breakfast range was extensive and very enjoyable,My wife loved the freeloading cat! Would certainly stay here again. 
4; Stayed her with my girlfriend when attending a concert at the o2 arena. Couldn't have asked for more really perfect location and everything from the staff to the rooms and food was of the highest standard. Not the cheapest in the area, but you get what you pay for and here you pay for quality! 
4; Really liked the Old Ship, I managed to secure a great rate via TravelRepublic and was more than happy with everything on offer. From the chap who checked me in, which was very efficient. Having booked online, I literally had to show my confirmation and was then given my room key and on my way.  The lift to the rooms is via the bar which was spacious enough for this size of hotel. One gripe possibly is that there seemed to be only one rickety old lift, this was fine but my room was on the 4th floor and I did find it easier sometimes to walk up and down rather than wait around.  The rooms were fine, spacious and you can pay for a sea-view I didn't this time around as I wasn't planning on spending too much time in there. The free wi-fi is a bonus, it's a little patchy in its connectivity, that said it's free and was adequate.  Sound enough sleep, no noise and this was at the weekend so really pleased with that. The breakfast was fantastic, really good selection of juices, cereals, bread and hot food that included sausages, mushrooms, bacon, egg, beans, hash browns and much more.  Well worth the money and if you shop around and get a good deal then even better. I have stayed in a good few hotels in Brighton now and this is definitely up there with the best in terms of value. 
4; We stayed at the The Osbourne Hotel Torquay the weekend starting 6th March 2015. When you arrive at the hotel the views of the bay and hotel take your breath away, this was probably helped by the fact it was a lovely sunny day!!  The hotel was built in the 1800s so the architecture is a regency building, the hotel has an indoor swimming pool, outdoor swimming pool (closed because of the time of season) a very good fitness centre and a very good restaurant, and the overall feel of the hotel is fabulous.  Upon our arrival we were greeted by the receptionist Jade, who made us feel very welcome, she informed us of our room and asked if we would like someone to help us with our bags, you don’t get that at the Premier Inn!! We asked her about local attractions and she could not have been more helpful. The next morning at breakfast we were greeted by waiting staff who showed us to our table, the breakfast menu was very good, offering lots of choice, the breakfast was a very good portion and very well cooked.   We would highly recommend this hotel, it is as beautiful inside as it is from the outside. The only negative I could find, and it’s not a Biggy, was that our room had “no service” on our mobile phones, as the hotel is situated in a bay, as soon as we went down stairs, service on the mobiles resumed. 
4; Just returned from a short break at this hotel, we had seen the previous comments re the bistro but had no such issues. The hotel staff were very friendly, the bistro was very busy and the food arrived promptly. We have stayed at a couple of other du Vin locations and found the Harrogate hotel to be at the standard we have come to expect from this group. 
4; A fantastic stay, probably the best bed ive ever been on, fab location with good restaurant near by, professional and very helpfull staff, very welcoming. really good hotel and i highly recomend it! a little pricy but worth evey penny. 
4; This was our second visit to the Crowne Plaza and it was just as enjoyable as the first time. We were there for the Paul McCartney concert and were made to feel most welcome from the minute we arrived. This time we had a river view room and what a view! Secure car parking was also a bonus as this is rare in Liverpool. Breakfast was really good with a wide choice. The staff were helpful and friendly, special thanks to Kayleigh who is a wee gem and an asset to the hotel. When in Liverpool again we would certainly stay here as Liverpool people are just fab.xx 
4; We stayed on a special winter deal for 3 nights in March and we rated this hotel perfect, all the staff were professional and efficient, we were upgraded on arrival and the room was spacious, modern and spotless, when we booked we didn't realise what a perfect location it was to see so many of the London sights and our room overlooked the back and was so quiet it was hard to believe we were in such a large, busy city, definitely recommended 
4;This hotel always makes you fell very welcome. The staff are always polite, friendly and remember who you are from visit to visit.  I have been staying at the same hotel now for more than 10 years spending 6 nights, 3 times a year, the staff rarely change and that is why they remember you. The restaurant staff are really great, always service with a smile and the food is really great. Never ha a complaint or a bad meal, service is 10/10
4;" This was our first stay in the Pullman Liverpool, a new hotel with decent reviews so our expectations were high. First surprise - on arrival there is no formal check in desk a such. Instead you are greeted by a friendly member of staff who leads you to a comfortable seating area and runs through the hotels many facilities and explains where the restaurant is, what times breakfast is served etc before handing over your room key - we found this such a huge pleasant game changer when checking in - we hate queueing at a reception desk waiting while a receptionist works their way through a queue of people all stood in line, overloaded with bags and other personal items and all you want is your room key! The Pullman way immediately provided a relaxing air to the whole checking in process, setting the tone for our stay. Our next surprise was our bedroom. Huge, air-conditioned, sleekly furnished with dark wood floors and tastefully modern furniture and furnishings, the (corner) room was light, airy, spotlessly clean and equipped with a huge super king bed (which was uber comfortable) and a fully tiled walk in wet/shower room with a brilliant rainfall shower and all finished classily with quality fittings and fluffy towels, bathrobes and slippers. Again, the bathroom was spotlessly clean, as was the bedding which was crisp and of a good quality. Ditto the pillows, which were vvv-comfortable. Views from the corner room were stunning from either side of the room, thanks to floor to ceiling windows. On one side the Mersey seemed to be within touching distance (the hotel is situated virtually on the river embankment) whilst through the north facing windows we had views of the 02 Arena, Big Wheel and the Liver Buildings beyond - again stunning views of these famous city landmarks. Once you became familiar with the views, a wall-mounted 40&quot; flat screen TV with channels galore was welcome, as was a COMPLIMENTARY refrigerated mini bar packed with beers, small bottles of wine, soft drinks, water etc - a really nice touch. The room was also equipped with full tea/chocolate making facilities, and in addition to the ubiquitous electric kettle was a Nespresso machine complete with an excellent choice of pods!! The hotel corridors were tastefully decorated and v-clean, lifts super quick and the bar area welcoming and comfortable, the perfect place to enjoy a coffee whilst perusing a book or magazine or an evening cocktail before enjoying a meal. The deal we booked included a 3-course dinner offer, so the restaurant also came under scrutiny. The choice of food on offer was excellent, staff very friendly and efficient and the wine list very reasonably priced if a little limited in choice. Best of all, the food was very good, something that would be mirrored the following morning at breakfast. Served buffet style, this was one of the best breakfasts we have had the pleasure of experiencing in any hotel anywhere in the world, with lots of quality products on offer and/or used in making the breakfast. Again, the staff were polite and very helpful.  Parking (which is a bug bear for us as we own what we think is a nice car) was painless in a multi-storey situated yards opposite the hotel - a 24 hour stay enjoys a £9 discounted rate, which meant that after parking up for the day on arrival at 4.30pm left us until the same time the following day to enjoy a day exploring Liverpool before returning to pick up our car, even though we had already checked out of the hotel earlier in the day. We took a taxi from our hotel to the back of the city centre then walked our way through the centre back down to Kings Dock, seeing all the sights and enjoying some retail therapy in Liverpool One - The taxi cost all of £3.00!!  All in all a magical stay. The Pullman receives a 5* review from us. It ticks all the boxes in what we look for in a hotel whilst not providing any niggles in other areas. We've stayed in quite a few Liverpool hotels but the Pullman in our eyes is by far the best all-rounder, and those riverside corner rooms are amazing!! "
4; Our second visit. A very well run hotel with pleasant staff and excellent food. The bedroom was well furnished and had a safe and modern TV. Our only comment was that if you are elderley you should ask for a room on the first floor so you don't have a steep flight of stairs to climb, the lift goes to the first floor, also the bedroom on the top floor was rather hot. One highlight was a short boat trip from Padstow on the Jubilee Queen around Puffin Island where we were lucky enough to be surrounded by dolphins and also had a good view of puffins although they will not be around after July. We can recommend this hotel as one of the best we have stayed in in the UK. 
4; We went to the du Vin as we are regular diners, but have never stayed there before, the experience was very good. The rooms and food are excellent and the service very professional and friendly. Thoroughly recommend it!!  
4;" We stayed over for a big night out with friends. The &quot;mini' apartment we had on the 18th floor was very spacious and funky looking - fabulous views over the City, the fresh orange juice (with oranges in the fridge!) was a welcome cure for the mild hangovers. Very stylish place, very helpful front desk (thanks Alex!), highly recommended. I did have some troubles with the booking - first the web site didn't actually complete the booking, giving me some error codes on the screen which was odd, then a couple of efforts to get email confirmation....but that was before staying, and didn't detract from our stay! Great night out, and a spot on location to visit the German market - it starts just outside the front door! "
4;" Hotel located in the centre of Southampton. For a traditional hotel I thought that it was maintained to a high standard. The bedrooms in particular were very good, especially the en-suite bathrooms, which all (I saw in 3 of them) appeared to be very modern and probably recently refurbished. The first room I was allocated did not suit me as it was ground floor, with no opening window. During my stay it was 27%C outside (I always sleep with a window open anyway). No air conditioning &quot;as a listed building&quot;, but fans provided. The reception staff were very obliging (all of the staff I saw were friendly and helpful) in finding me a fourth floor room with opening window. The first room I had been allocated was very quiet. The second room was overlooking the High Street and I was advised there might be some noise, but actually it was very quite from, say, midnight to 07.00 a.m. I was very comfortable in there. The lift only goes up to the third floor - not a problem for me. Virtually next door is a Wetherspoon's: traditional English breakfast £3.29, unlimited filtered coffee £1.15. The 'Tavern House' (bottom of High Street, turn left along Town Quay) was an interesting 'quirky' pub; with occasional live music. Oxford Street was quite I lively area at night. "
4; We had two rooms one double one twin, both spacious ,nice shampoos etc.Teas,coffee, hot chocolate and biscuits very nice. In room safe very useful, flat screen TV. Room and bathroom very clean slightly old fashioned decor, staff very pleasant, did not eat in restaurant so cant comment.15 minutes walk to race course or taxi for £5.00.There was a shuttle bus from the hotel to racecourse which we thought was free but £2.00 per person.Would rate 4.5 due to the windows being old sash windows, just being picky !!! Will definitely stay here next time and forgot to mention swimming pool and gym looked very good. 
4; This hotel corrects many of the things that so many hotels get wrong, especially in London. Free Wi-Fi, free non-alchoholic mini bar, wide range of breakfast options at very reasonable prices for an hotel of this standard. Rooms and bathrooms are all you would expect and the reception staff are quite exceptional. We arrived via the Heathrow Express, after a long flight , at 8.30 am and despite the hotel having been full the previous night, the staff rushed to get a room prepared and we and our luggage were in our room in not much more than half an hour. 
4; I took my wife to the Compleat Angler for a romantic night away and we were not disappointed. The hotel is situated in a lovely location right on the river. We were shown to our room which was spacious and well presented. We liked the old-world feel of the hotel which has none of the pretentiousness of some of the newer, expensive London hotels. The staff throughout our stay were friendly, helpful and a credit to the hotel.  We ate dinner in the Riverside restaurant and the food was superb, certainly comparable with top restaurants in London (again the restaurant staff were excellent).  We spent the next day wandering 'round Marlow which has a nice 'village' feel and there are lots of shops and bars where you can while away a few hours.  As we live in London we wanted to get away from the city but didn't want to travel too far. We really enjoyed our trip to the Compleat Angler and we're already looking forward to our next visit.  
4; I really enjoyed my stay here for several reasons. The first is the staff really seemed to enjoy working there and are friendly and efficient. Secondly, it is very clean. Thirdly, it is good looking and has plenty of charm and my room was of a decent size - and the food is excellent.   The location is also very handy. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  We were there for one night and it more than met our needs. 
4;Had a weekend in London for shopping and culture. The location of the hotel is perfect, right in the heart of Soho. Plenty of great bars and restaurants on the doorstep. A short walk to Covent Garden, Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street how much more shopping do you need? Also a short walk to The British Museum, Royal Academy of Art, National Portrait Gallery all very cultural. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel has great character and charm, an island of calm right in the centre of the action. Our room was a bit on the small side but this is normal for city hotels. We have put this one on the list to use again for our London visits.
4; We stayed at the Bewleys once more and we were very satisfied by the service, the cleanliness and efficiency of the staff. A little drawback was the price of a glass of wine (125ml) in the bar. How could a £5 charge be justified? Everything else was excellent. Strongly recommended. 
4; I would like to thank for an excellent service and delicious cocktails the bartender whose name unfortunately I do not remember, but I am pretty sure he was a Polish guy. Me and my girlfriend went for a drink on saturday night to Sky Lounge for a first time and already were surprised about this place. Sky team greeted us very welcome and provided us an excellent service and nice chat. Certainly we' ll come back again. 
4; The name City Inn immediately makes you think of other more well-known rivals such as Travel Inn or Jury's Inn. I will tell you now, its NOTHING like that whatsoever. Its much nicer. Located just behind Millbank Tower (HQ of the Labour Party) and next to the Tate Britain Gallery - for politicians and art lovers this is the place to stay.  Midweek the rates are around £130 - but come weekend at it drops to around £70. And THAT is a great deal. Its cheaper because let's face it, you're staying in the business & political district of London. There ain't much open really. There are many shops nearby - they're about a 10 minute walk away towards Victoria. So it can seem quite peaceful at weekend. Westminster Tube is about a 15 minute walks - Pimlico is just around the corner - about a 5 minute stroll... but as for the hotel, you won't be disappointed. The rooms are fabulous. There are suites available, but the one we stayed in looked swank enough for my tastes. See the pics i've taken. The pillows and bed here are some of the softest I've stayed in. The bathroom comes with condiements from the White Company (like a poor man's Molten Brown!). You also get a flatscreen TV, CD player, DVD Player too and a safe. The air conditioning works well too and to put the heat on after braving the London cold was just what we needed. Its spotlessly clean too.  The staff here are friendly also. Extra towels were devlivered within minutes... and after coming in from the freezing London night, we were greeted by a man in the lobby handing out free gin-based cocktails. Actually - it was a lovely surprise and most unexpected. You can pick up a free newspaper in the lobby, or just lounge around on one of the chaise-long's. There's also a large restuarant here and a rather posh-looking Millbank Lounge. This is basically just a bar, but it looks great dressed in the hotels minimalist red and white colour scheme.  So, say 'City Inn' and you can see why the name doesn't do it justice. But maybe that's why its one of Millbanks best hidden hotel secrets.  
4; Chose this hotel to treat my girlfriend on her birthday. Inside was stunning and the Norman Shaw suite which we stayed in was fantastic. The double whirlpool jacuzzi bath was a great way to get ready for a night out and even more fun to come back to when drunk!   There was a lovely bottle of Prosseco champagne on arrival and even a birthday card from the hotel set up on the table.   With it already being in the city centre there was no need for taxis to restaurants/bars and there was a complimentary continental breakfast in the morning.   10/10! 
4; We stayed at this hotel in the little town of Ogbourne to break up two legs of a walk along the Ridgeway. The rooms are on the small side but quiet and very pleasant, with everything you'd need, and a very comfy bed with more pillows than you can shake a stick at. What makes this hotel really stand out, though, is the food. Frankly, it's brilliant. I had the best evening meal I've ever had in any hotel (ham and eggs - just amazing) and breakfast was similarly sensational, with nothing but locally sourced food. Just wonderful. The hoteliers were kind and friendly, and all things considered I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. 
4; We decided to take a short notice trip to Cambridge and found the Varsity Hotel. We could not have been happier with our stay. We phoned the hotel in advance to talk about our requirements as we had an 18 month year old with us. The staff could not have been more helpful or attentive, they were responsive to all of our asks/demands (!). We were even given a free upgrade to provide with extra space for the cot. We used the valet parking and car was available for us right outside the hotel at the time requested. I even decided to treat myself to a massage at the spa and found availability at short notice and very reasonably priced. We would definitely go back there, we found no negates with our stay. 
4;" We've been up to Leeds from London three times to drop my son off and pick him up from the university. This hotel was so good in every aspect.  I've stayed in far too many so-called five star hotels which are really 4...or even 3. This is the other way round. Our room was as luxurious and spacious as the the one we had at The Dorchester in Park Lane, central London for my niece's wedding. Honestly! And it makes such a welcome change to have hot breakfast served to your table by a professional waiter (remember those?) rather than the buffet scramble at most hotels. The room on the 4th floor for breakfast is just right. The two young women and one young bloke (Chris?) at reception were genuinely friendly and helpful; they were clearly proud to work for this hotel and the owners are lucky to have them. This is our hotel in Leeds now. Period! (as the Americans say). "
4; We first stayed here when we had to pick a family member up from an early morning cruise drop off in Southampton. Perfect for this purpose as only15 minutes by car away from docks but on the edge of the New Forest and both the scenery and town are spectacular. Perfect for long walks along the River Test. Anyway we enjoyed it so much that we returned this time with three teenage boys and two dogs. Boys stayed in a standard room, which we had last time and was very passable and we upgraded to the penthouse. Penthouse was fantastic for the money. In the eaves of the original building it had plenty of space with a sizable bed, chaisse longe and three comfortable leather armchairs looking ata large flat screen TV. There was also a very clean and well appointed sizable bathroom with a roll top bath. The room overlooked the market square and the only issue we had was the early morning noise when we slept for the first night with the windows open as stall holders set up. However, this was easily solved on subsequent nights by closing the windows and using the effective aircon to deal with the heat. On the first evening we ate in the recently refurbised restaurant which we have frequented before and I believe has to be one of the best in the area. The ambience is excellent, the menu selection about as good as you will get anywhere, the wine reasonably priced for the quality it represents, the food excellent and even a little eclectic and the service (as throughout the hotel as well) very professional if a little impersonal. The Head Waiter/Barman is especially personable and well informed. On warm days you have the option of dinning for breakfast, lunch and dinner in the beautifully presented courtyard which is also something of a sun trap. Breakfast on both days was excellent and wide ranging. It included a well stocked buffet with quality pastries and very nice local yogurts and the hot a la carte menu covered all the usual options. On the second day we decided to forgoe dinner and instead have a cream tea. Ohh my god - the most amazing cream tea I have ever had and an absoute must if you are the least bit interested in such creations. The qantity and quality are off the scale and the way the tea is surved is kind of special. A word of warning though - avoid breakfast in preperation for this gargantuan extravaganza. 
4; Booked this B & B based on the reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed, The B & B is centrally located, within walking distance to many pubs and restaurants. As it was my partners Birthday a bouquet of flowers was requested, and on arrival these were waiting in the room (paid for by me, they were not freebies)  The rooms are decorated to a high standard with a great shower, they are clean and have tea and espresso making facilities.  We had the cooked breakfast, served in your room, on both mornings which was a great start to the day.  The owner is very welcoming and will assist in anyway possible to make the most of your stay,   Would highly recommend - 5 * 
4;Thank you so much. From the customer service from Karly via email. Thank you for all your help. To the fantastic room and view and breakfast. Fantastic location on broad street across the road from part of the christmas market and bars. Car park only a few minutes walk away at paradise circus. Only a couple of minor gripes. Be careful which we way you get into Birmingham due to the closed roads. But of course not hotel fault. and the queue at the bar, had to wait quite a long time due to the charity ball. Table service was on but again a long wait for that.possibly another bar needed in these times.
4; This hotel is a little gem . Less than ten minutes walk from Oxford street so pretty central with plenty of bars and restaunts near by and a tube stop 5 mins walk  The hotel its self is modern clean and tidy with helpful staff with an ncp car park underneath . 
4; My wife, daughter and I go to Bournemouth about two/three times a year and always stay at the Marriott.   The weekend we had a Junior Suite and stayed Friday and Saturday night and the service was first class as usual!   It's also nice to see that they are doing some painting to refresh the decor!   See you next time ! 
4; We have just returned from spending the Jubilee weekend at Saunton Sands and had a great time. Loads of activities and facilities for the us to get involved in - plus a great surfing beach on the door step (even great in the bank holiday rain). Great beach views from the bar and restaurant and a really friendly family atmosphere throughout - not clinical like large chains. Would def recommend. 
4; Stayed at Hotel March 2015. Hotel is in a great location, close to Gloucester Road tube station. Friendly staff. Breakfast choice excellent for the price. Highly recommend this hotel.  Good value for money 
4; Attending a two-day business event, I was booked in at Conference Aston Hotel by the event organisers and was very impressed. With free Wifi, this clean & well-equipped hotel is very professionally presented on-campus at Aston University, which is convenient for the City Centre and Railway Station(s). 
4; We stayed at the Grand at half term and paid a bit extra to get a larger seafront room. It was definitely worth it as the room, and the view was absolutely beautiful. The bed was really comfortable and the Bluetooth player was great. We ate in the restaurant one night and that was outstanding.  Generally we had a really great time only having a couple of negatives.  While we were there the hotel was having regular power cuts, every few minutes, so the lifts were out of action. This meant that the lifts were also out of action and our room was on the fifth floor so quite a walk and that limited us a bit. Also it meant that hot food was not available for a good chunk of our stay. When we checked out there was a general kind of apology but I did feel that it had impacted ours, and everybody else' stay significantly and was surprised there wasn't some sort of discount.  The other negative was that on the Saturday morning the service at breakfast was a bit slow. We were seated but then overlooked by all the waiting staff, nobody came and asked us what we wanted to drink.  But generally I would recommend the Grand and would definitely stay there again. 
4; Just returned from butlins (Monday - Friday ) holiday. It was our first time visiting and we was surprised how much we enjoy our self's.  Family of 4 youngest being 3. Check in was easy just can't get in your room till 4 but you can park up and use everything on site. Stayed in a silver apartment which was nice and clean and had everything you needed. Beds where ok and slept fine. Only problem we had is the walls are plaster board and had hear alot from next doors and especially from above If you are ground floor. Parking Was about 20 second walk out of the door but you can park anywhere. Fairground - My 3 year old could get on about 4 of the 8 bigger rides if with one of the adults but there is also a smaller fair which is designed for under 8s also.  All are free other than karting and trampoline thing. Swimming was great, though it was busy still room to swimming and lots of places to watch. Entainment - was fine does get very busy, people do que to get in and get to the front but we wasn't bothered so went in after the que. Food - didn't eat on site we drive to local pubs and you can get back in showing your Card.  All the staff red coats and security were friendly. Overall had a nice time and the kids had a really good time.   
4; their mark up only had a night's stay but wish it was longer. The suite at the front, room 101 (I know it made me smile too) was huge. I lay in bed knowing the history of this place as the former BBC head office then a BBC training center. Dr Who used it many times as it's so full of atmosphere and intrigue. I wondered if a Dalek had stood where I slept and as a child used to hide behind the sofa. The evening dinner was really good with a fab selection of some cracking wines, even a Margeaux 2005 if one was willing to splash out for it. Although, knowing wines, the mark up was very reasonable. The staff were attentive and genuine. Made me smile and definately wanted to make sure you were satisfied. I stuffed myself with an excellent breakfast and made a mental note to return. 
4; Just returned from a long weekend at the Langtry Manor and the quality is as high as ever. The restaurant and staff are highly recommended. Many thanks to Tara and her family. 
4;I stayed here for three nights and chose the hotel for its location. Its ideal as its in the heart of Manchester, a little noise from the street - buts that's to be expected. The staff are friendly and professional, I loves the room, tea & Coffee and we spent £20 upgrading to a huge room - well worth the money
4; This is the 2nd time we have stayed at The Apex City of London Hotel and once again we loved it. The staff were welcoming and incredibly helpful. The room was excellent and the food was great. Their cooked breakfast should be sampled by everyone and set us up for the day. The location of the hotel, 2 mins walk to the Tower of London is great with excellent tube and train connections. I'll certainly be back, and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. 
4; What a beautiful grand place to stay , friendly staff , beautiful location and second to none accommodation,met with champagne and Michael caines restaurant fabulous will be returning soon can't recommend highly enough 
4; A beautiful hotel, with beautiful views and in a great location. One of the nicest rooms I've had the pleasure of staying in Cornwall. I would highly recommend this hotel not only for the above but also as the staff couldn't be more helpful. No request is to big or small. 
4; We stayed just the one night, but we found the hotel to be really nice. The reception staff were friendly, effiicent and helpful. The room was clean, tidy, well presented and the beds were very comfortable. In the morning we had the buffet breakfast and it was fantastic - lots of choice, good quality and again very good service. Nothing to fault this hotel - it's bang in the middle of Reading centre and I'd very much recommend it to anyone who wants a decent central place to stay.  A cautionary note on the parking - the on-site parking doesn't have many spaces and they fill up fast, so don't expect to be able to park at the hotel itself. Fortunately there is an NCP and other car parks all within 5 minutes walk of the hotel. 
4; We have just been to Thoresby Hall Hotel on a spa day, on a reduced price through Woucher.com. It was from 9 am to 5 pm and included a two course lunch. (Third course optional for £5) You can use the swimming pool, suanas, steam rooms, jacquosis, ice room, hot room, coffee lounge, etc and it's all extremely good. Well worth it and we will be going again. 
4; i always have a great stay at this hotel, i will always return. the service was great , the room were very comfy . well done to the hilton staff and i will see them very soon. lovely hotel and worth all the money spent 
4;" What an amazing transformation; we stayed as a family of four when it was The Waterside, we thought it was lovely then. A fantastic location with a friendly family run atmosphere. We stayed for three nights at The Daffodil in August, the Hotel has gone through a complete refurbishment/rebuild and is now a fantastic luxurious hotel that is setting the standard for all others to achieve. It has the trappings of a large chain of luxury hotels together with the friendly family run atmosphere. We stayed again as a family of four in a junior suite, room 201 (Butterflies). It consisted of two rooms divided by sliding doors, the kids had their own space with quality sofa beds . Our room had an enormous bed, all the facilities you'd expect in a quality hotel, a bathroom with separate bath and shower stocked with Molton Brown toiletries. Room 201 has a fantastic view out across Grasmere lake. The Spa facilities weren't open, we were shown round and they look fabulous! The buffet breakfast is substantial and excellent, evening meals are quality (you won't need to visit the local fish and chip shop after eating in this restaurant). What an amazing experience, it puts the icing on the cake when visiting the Lakes. "
4; Stayed here on the 06/06/15 the night before our flight, and then on our return home on the 13/06/15. It was myself and my wife's first time flying from Heathrow so wasn't to familiar with hotels near the airport. We decided to go for this hotel as I am a IHG Rewards Club member and try to stick to IHG hotels where I can as I am always happy with the standard of most hotels I have stayed at and you get points for stays which is a added bonus.  The hotel is in a great location only 10 minutes from Terminal 3 (not sure if any further for other terminals). Reception staff polite and friendly, Rooms nice, food was good (only had room service mind).   Would recommend to anyone flying out of Heathrow, and we will definitely will stay here again if I am flying from Heathrow when we next go on holiday. 
4;" This small hotel restaurant is excellent. The rooms are very well furnished, the food is excellent and the staff first class. The &quot;silver service&quot; is equally first class. Naturally such high standards do not come cheaply, but the cost is well worth it. This was our second visit and we plan to stay again next year. "
4; Great hotel, adjacent to Manchester Airport terminals and the railway station. The hotel runs a complimentary shuttle service to both. Large comfortable room and hotel had clearly been recently refurbished. Good to find American style customer service in the UK at an affordable price. 
4; I have been travelling to Ilfracombe for most of the past 60 years (since I was four): my mother lived here for over 40 years until she died last year so, suddenly, I had no reason to come back. On a whim I decided to become a tourist and found this hotel online. From the moment Adam met me to the moment I left Paula and Adam after three nights' stay, I could not have wished for a better place to act as a base. I stayed in Room 7, right at the top, and it was perfect for my needs. The breakfasts were very good (as an inveterate hotel traveller I have had far worse in so-called top hotels) and I just felt at home. Guests are all made welcome and newcomers to the area given plenty of practical advice on where to go and what to do: yet you are also free to come and go as you please. I have never written a hotel review before but Adam and Paula deserve this praise and I will come back next August.  Anthony Hunt 
4;Excellently located hotel, just off Oxford Street, with friendly helpful staff.  we stayed in a queen size suite on 7th floor and was super quiet with excellent air conditioning. Only grumble was the windows had wooden slatted Venetian blinds that look great but were not fantastic at keeps the light out in the morning. We ate at the brasserie on Friday night and was impressed but did not have breakfast in the hotel as we found the Ivy Cafe, just round the corner that was superb. Would certainly stay again.  .
4;" A bit of a mix-up over rooms but quickly sorted out. Clean, well-equipped room with comfortable beds. All the staff we dealt with were friendly and efficient.  The breakfast in the restaurant next door was excellent; nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were constantly replenishing the buffet items.   Large free car park that we never had any trouble finding a space on. Overall, excellent value for money. When you consider the quality of some other budget hotels then you can't fault this. "
4; If you enjoy good company and a fantastic staff then I recommend to stay here. We arrived for the weekend , and from the very beginning we where looked after. I was first greeted by Jessica. with a lovely smile and a soft spoken voice made us feel at home . The rooms were clean smart and had a very warm feel to them. the bar area in the lobby was great after a long day walking in Manchester. On arriving back our drinks served with a smile by Kim hit the spot, the weekend went great and so did the hotel. 
4;" A superb authentic English Country House. It felt like staying in Downton Abbey or Gosford Park, only this is the real thing. Furnished with exquisite antiques throughout the public rooms and the bedrooms.  We stayed two nights in one of the second floor rooms in the main house, with a view over the front lawns and lake. The room was enormous, with extra king-size bed, very comfortable. Walk in closet; very spacious bathroom, and quaint traditional touches like window seats in the dormer windows, and traditional English blankets from Witney. Superb hi-speed wi-fi. Returning the second evening to our room it felt like a cosy mini-apartment. The ground floor rooms and salons ooze loads of period character and are furnished in superb taste. Each room is practically a different style as if the house has evolved over three centuries of interior architecture. The parkland compact and very easy to walk around.  The spa facilities were also superb and very relaxing. Even had a chance to use the outdoor hot tub which was a novelty for December in the UK. Steam room, jacuzzi and pool. The pool is only 4ft 6 in deep throughout. A most comfortable and restful break. Very courteous staff. "
4; Rang in advance for a table at lunchtime on our 52nd Wedding Anniversary 28th Sept.Arrived on time having driven from Derby.We were warmly welcomed in reception by Will who was our waiter.Drinks were served in the bar and very shortly after ordering we were taken through to the very pleasantly appointed dining room overlooking the extensive front lawned area.Our starters and main courses were very filling and well presented,we had no room for desserts but did manage coffees.Will looked after us admirably.We have been to Kelham House several times before and have always been well looked after.My wife and I would highly recommend the food and service in this restaurant to anyone travelling near Newark,having spoken to other guests that day it was indicated that the accommodation also was good.Will definitely be eating here again. 
4;" My wife and I were looking for a convenient location to visit National Trust and similar properties. We chose the Prince Rupert Hotel which proved to be an ideal setting for such a holiday. The members of staff were unfailingly friendly and polite; the hotel seeming to operate with quiet efficiency at all times. The breakfast provided each day was of the highest quality, with waitress service to match. Our recently refurbished room was well appointed, clean and very peaceful. We would recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, friendly place to stay. "
4; We booked this hotel quite last minute (2 days before), location being our most important factor as we were volunteering 'planting' poppies at the Tower of London. Paying about £129 per night, not excessive for London - Premier Inns were more expensive on this particular weekend !!  The hotel is very accessable, a couple of minutes from Tower Hill tube station on the DLR / Circle / District Lines. The hotel gives a very clean, welcoming and stylish feel on entering the reception, with a wonderful seating area and small bar located not far from guest services. We were very quickly dealt with at reception, with excellent service from the desk staff, a welcome cookie being a pleasant surprise.  The hotel has a wide range of facilties, the bar as mentioned, two restaurants, an excutive lounge with restricted access, a gym facility, and a spectacular rooftop bar with amazing views if a little expensive. The room was very clean and well looked after each day by the housekeeping staff. Rather than a standard TV each room is provided with an Apple which gives access to additional features like the internet along with the standard TV channels. Our room looked onto an inner courtyard of an adjacent building so not much of a view, but we spent so little time in the room this wasnt an issue (7th Floor Room 730).  We received excellent service over our 3 day stay, and were very impressed by the facilties and the location. The hotel provides a left luggage facility, so take advantage of this to extend you sighseeing / shopping experioence.  We usually stay at the Holiday Inn Stratford Westfield, but from now on will be staying here. I wouldnt hestitate to recommend this hotel for your london stay. 
4; We have just returned from a lovely weekend as a family of four (7 & 8 Year old) We came here to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary, as we got married at the hotel. Very relaxing weekend, great pool, sauna, and steam room. The kids have already asked to go back again. Unfortunately didn't get chance to have a Spa treatment as it was fully booked, so I would recommend booking before you arrive. Food was very good but again would advise you to book early. The only negative comment I have is that it is hard to get served at the bar as a resident, as there seems to be a lot of none residents that also use the bar. 
4; This year my companies party was a themed affair at the Goodwood Hotel. The hotel helped with the organisation of the evening in every way they could. They were helpful, and very proactive. On the night the staff did all they could to make sure the event went smoothly. The food was very good and the service excellent. After the party some of the guests finished off the evening in the Richmond bar which was very welcoming. The rooms were good and clean and breakfast very good. Highly recommended. 
4;" We've stayed before at St. Anne's Manor Hotel and had previously experience excellent service and this stay was no exception. We were at the hotel for two nights to celebrate my father's 80th birthday and altogether there were two families of four plus my parents making 10 of us in five rooms. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were totally overwhelmed by the service and attention to detail given to us by all members from every department in the hotel. At check in we were expected and it was smiles and professionalism, the rooms have been refurbished to a very high standard, the meals especially, the buffet, were plentiful, hot, well presented and very tasty. In the restaurant, nothing was too much trouble whether it was at dinner or breakfast. The rooms were bright & clean, the shower was amazing, the bed was so comfortable my wife and I had the best night's sleep in ages. Bearing in mind we had a range of ages from 14 to 80, there was plenty to do for everyone. In the public area there was a Wii, the leisure club has an excellent gym, the pool was warm and the sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi were perfect. The ice cold water machine at the poolside was very welcome when coming out of the sauna. We brought a surprize cream birthday cake (which the hotel put in their fridge overnight) and some candles with us and ordered cream tea. Unfortunately the lettering on the cake became faded so without prompting the chef re wrote happy birthday etc. on the cake and the base board and brought it in to the conservatory singing happy birthday. Cream tea was amazing, finger sandwiches, cake, scones, cheese cake far too much but my father loved it as did all of us. The buffet dinner had a fantastic selection of Hot & cold hors douvres, a soup, several hot dishes for anyone's taste even for younger kids who might just want chicken nuggets & chips. There was curry, different types of fish, braised steak, veggie options, loads of salads and the desserts were superb too, tiramisu, trifle, other cakes and fancies, ice-cream, fresh fruit salad & fresh fruit. The hotel is set in acres of grass & woodland, we saw a deer in the garden and it's great to explore. The location is great for shopping locally in Wokingham and is not far from Reading for &quot;big&quot; shopping (for the girls) and also near by the Coral Reef water park and the Look Out set in Swinley Forrest. All in all, I couldn't fault the Hotel or its staff one little bit and so I'm scoring it 10/10 for everything. We will definitely be coming back. "
4; Had an amazing meal here for my step-daughters birthday. Very helpful staff, lovely setting and brilliant food. Would definitely eat here again. Was perfect for a special occasion. A 3 course menu costs you £23 with a wide range of choices for each course. The hardest part was choosing. 
4; For one day with kids, its great hotel and clean also spacious room. The toilets door was creative.....Free car parking which good deal. nice experience and we will stayed at this hotel when we visit Bristol. 
4;We met for a family 'rendevous' at The hotel is perfectly situated for a walk with dogs and then we went for a swim - the facilities are immaculate. We were welcomed for lunch at the Seaside Restaurant despite being 30mibs late for our table - nothing seems to be a problem in Storitz land! From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave the service is excellent. We were a party of 15 with 7 kids and all enjoyed our trip - being able to send the kids out to play at the end of the meal is an added bonus. If you are in Cornwall and are looking for a good Sunday lunch spot look no further. The perfect place to kick back and chill.
4; My wife and I have stayed at the Feversham Arms on a few occasions now but, each time we stay it just seems to get better. From the moment we arrived right through until we checked out the following morning the service and experience was simply wonderful. We had the benefit of a very sunny weekend which meant that we were able to spend most of the time sat beside the pool relaxing, which makes a pleasant change from being at home with our four children. Our room was spacious and very comfortable and the staff were always available to help without constantly hovering around. We will definitely be returning again this summer. 
4; Lovely building set in extensive well maintained grounds close to good transport links with great leisure facilities including a pool.. Only spent one night here as part of a visit to LEGOLAND and this was part of a great couple of days. The staff were very professional and child friendly and the dining experience was to a high standard 
4; We hired Buxted Park on an exclusive use basis for our wedding on Easter weekend.  In the build up to our wedding we found our wedding co-ordinator helpful and attentive to our needs and always received a quick response to emails.  All of our guests on the wedding day itself commented on how impressed they were with the venue and the service. Nothing seemed to much trouble.  We had several foody types (chefs etc) in our wedding party who were all very complimentary about quality of our wedding breakfast.  Expensive, but great value and worth every penny. 
4; We recently stayed for a weekend here as a treat for my wife's birthday and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Dinners in the restaurant were superb and the food and beverages manager Kemal made sure we were made very welcome. I can certainly recommend this hotel as it is in a fantastic location in a beautiful Cotswold village. Ample parking is available for the hotel as I know this can be a problem in tourist locations. Everything combined to make this an enjoyable and memorable visit 
4; Check in was polite, Informative,efficient, welcoming and above all friendly. Thanks Hannah!  Terrific room with a view and looking forward to my jacuzzi bath tonight :)  Still got twenty characters to write... 
4; Newly refurbished, delightful staff, excellent room. Everyone was accommodating, just really enjoyed the whole experience.   The club room wasn't overly big, but the furnishing and freebies made up for that.  Free car parking, quite fast Wifi and complimentary club room breakfast was awesome. I would highly recommend this hotel. 
4;" The beds are crap, just frames which are creaking uncomfortable & loose. We asked for the noisey bed to be sorted out, the nice lady at Customer Services (screamers & complaints) said &quot;yes, Ill send a man&quot; we returned to the room later & the bed was much better. However it had been pulled away from the wall and the pillows were going to vanish slowley down the back as there is no headboard. So I pushed it back up the wall, then it made creaking noises again, even when I pulled it back out. Contreversal but, there is a lot of special needs adults with very good careers, never a problem & Butlins is a good safe location were people can feel comfortable & safe. There are some kids who should be at school & Butlins advertise deals for children during school time, is that inticement or entrapment or colusion ? sorry about the spelling. Premier dinning is great, Paid extra for Skyline upper lounge, but the settees are straight back & very uncomfortable.  Splashworld is great in the water or just lounging on the laid out side relaxing areas. WiFi needs to be better & more of it. Front room coffee shop has short opening hours. We have taken the kids for 20yrs, now we go just as a couple smashing holiday. "
4; My wife and I (I still can’t get over saying that!) have just returned from an amazing 2 week honeymoon and I thought I would just send this message to Thornton Hall to thank them for our fantastic wedding day. From the start of the day to the end, they couldn’t have been more helpful. We were treated like VIP’s and kept informed throughout. My wife had organised timings for everything, but there was really no need as the staff knew what we wanted and ensured nothing was forgotten. They even sorted out our glitch, forgetting the mother of the bride’s present and they organised for flowers to be delivered just in time. We had pictures taken in the gardens and champagne was brought out to us by the staff. The manager then announced us into the room and he had everyone on their feet clapping and cheering. The staff also formed a line welcoming us. The room was gorgeous and they had laid it out just how we wanted it. As for food, we had chicken and liver pate to start, followed by roast beef and a selection of desserts. Our wine just kept flowing and even though we only ordered half a bottle per person, the waiters just kept coming round and refilling our glasses, we both wondered if they forgot the amount we ordered but we are not complaining! The meal was fantastic, thank you! After the speeches it was then time to relax. I couldn’t believe it was evening already. Before long the buffet was served, which like the wedding breakfast looked great and tasted even better. The manager then invited me outside on the gardens for a free cognac and cigar, which was a surprise! My friends and family were also invited to join me for this and we toasted the day in style.  A little while later the first dance was announced and the DJ invited all the guests to join us. It was great to see so many dancing and having fun. As it was such a warm day, we then went outside and drank cocktails, finally getting to our suite at 2am. We both had a fantastic day and would like to say a massive thank you to all at Thornton Hall. You made our day so special and we will never forget it. 
4; After having stayed in different hotels in London, it became my favourite one. Rooms are very nice and spotlessly clean, the staff is very kind and helpful. Breakfast is good value with plenty of choice. The location is convenient, only 5 minutes walk to the tube station where many different lines are available. The bar is a very pleasant place to have a drink, managed by the friendly Pavlina who makes the best mojitos in the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel for all these reasons and the affordable rates of the rooms. 
4; I stayed here for four nights on 29th June. Everything was included including Premium movies. My only minor comments was that premium wifi was extra and I would have expected it to be included in a hotel of this standard and price range. Also the parking was extra (£3 per night) but otherwise staff were very friendly and relaxed. 
4;My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Flemings. ALL the staff were very helpful and friendly and welcoming. Excellent service. The room was well appointed and a good size for a Central London hotel. We were very happy with every element of our stay. We can't wait to return! Thank you Flemings.
4; On arrival at the hotel the reception staff were very friendly and assertive. They made sure everything was to my satisfaction and in order. Later, when I noticed a very small issue with one of the electrical appliances, I called reception and was offered another room straight away. It seemed that nothing was too small and that the staff really cared that our time at the hotel was perfect.  The hotel styling is clearly the creation of a very talented individual. The finish in this hotel is second to none with great styling and top quality bed, general furnishings and bathroom facilities.   The hotel bar is vibrant and has a great atmosphere. The hotel is in a fantastic part of Brighton known as the North Laine. The North Laine is a vibrant, cosmopolitan part of Brighton with a real bohemian feel to it. Lots of independent shops, restaurants and bars dotted around every corner.  This trip was a real treat! Totally recommended . 
4;Just had two nights here on 21 and 22 October and had a great stay. This is our third or fourth stay in this hotel and can't fault it. We arrived a bit too early so left the suitcase with the concierge. Arrived back in the afternoon, bag in the room and two minute check-in. Yes, some of the rooms can be a bit dated but nothing to ruin your stay. A lot of people comment on this but I think that is part of the charm. There is a refurbishment underway. The staff are excellent! We received excellent service at the bar during the half price cocktails and would have stayed longer but we had plans. Breakfast was great and again, the staff were very attentitive, especially the young blond guy and the French maitre D, we did not have to wait for anything. Sorry not good with names. The only issue I have is some of the rudest guests I have ever came across. How the staff retain their composure is beyond me. Will be staying here again on our next visit, without doubt.
4; Stayed here following a rugby game at Twickenham and the hotel was very easy to get to after the game. The location is ideal with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. Museums are easy walks away as are Hyde park and Kensington Gardens. The hotel itself is excellent with friendly staff and large rooms with comfortable beds. The breakfast was arguably the highlight of the stay with both cooked and cold items perfectly prepared. Extremely impressed overall, especially with the price in this key location 
4; This hotel surpasses expectations, it's evident that the management have gone to great lengths to create a tranquil, warm, welcoming envirnoment that you would associate with a boutique of this kind.   The staff are friendly, engaging and accommodating  The bedrooms (I'd recomment the Junior Suite) - beautifully appointed with real attention to detail  Breakfast was lovely   My only disappointment was I only stayed for 1 day/night .... Wished it was longer 
4; Thirteen of us stayed here for a meeting on the 3rd/4th September on business. Having being the first off-site meeting I'd attended I didn't know what to expect. However from the start the staff were very friendly and willing to help. They stuck to the agenda we agreed on throughout the day and were happy to settle any enquiries we had throughout the day with much efficiency. We could not complain with any of the meals we had, from the executive lunch, to the 3-course dinner and breakfast in the morning not one person had a bad thing to say. In addition the rooms themselves were very impressive, nice big comfy beds with pleasant views (helped by the sunny weather).  Overall we were all very impressed with the Abbey Hotel and would certainly consider visiting again in the future. 
4; Had a two night break ,great location ,friendly staff,Blancs brasserie attached,best spot in bath Queens square,dont miss this one,would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants a two night break in bath. 
4; One of the outstanding things about this hotel is the staff - fropm check-in to check-out, they were all extremely courteous and efficient. The hotel itself is of a very high standard and if you have breakfast included, it's really impressive, good selection and tasty. The breakfast serving staff were cheerful and helpful but not in your face. Location wise, the hotel couldn't be better placed. I look forward to returning. 
4; This is a great hotel with very friendly staff. Good food and drinks and ideal place to stay if visiting any of the events at Goodwood race track. Stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed it, not the cheapest place but very nice. 
4;Stayed at this hotel for one night whilst children stayed with grandparents, so the location was ideal as it was close. The hotel is modern and well equipped, perhaps too modern for some! In early Janaury cheap rates were available. The breakfast was excellent, a mixture, of buffet and made to order. The king size room was large and vert confortable. Thé hôtel is well placed for Weston and Cheddar and the adjacent garden centre!   My only real complaint? The usual exhorbetantr bar prices!  Definatley one to visit again.
4; Stayed here for two nights whilst visiting York for the girlfriends birthday. Clean and spacious room, a small but adequate swimming pool. Car parking is expensive, but it's convenient and I had no trouble finding a car parking space. Definitely recommend for a weekend away. 
4; Excellent hotel in great location with very friendly and professional staff. Great buffet breakfast and comfortable rooms. Definitely would recommend it highly. 
4; My wife and I have just come back from our 10th wedding anniversary at No. Ten Manchester Street Hotel. One word can describe the experience .... magical! The service was second to none, the food was perfect and the cigar terrace a place to tell your grand kids about (when they are old enough to enjoy a fine cigar of course!). I phoned up the day before to ask for 10 roses to be placed in our room before we arrived and sure enough we had the nicest bunch of flowers we will see in a long time. The staff really knew what a good cigar is all about but never forgot that my wife didn't smoke by providing her with a box of chocolates each night. I'm only 33 and have been lucky to stay in a number of exclusive hotels but No.10 is right on top of the list and we will be visiting again. 
4; Excellent service and top quality hotel. Bar a little lacking in atmosphere but the breakfasts were exceptional. So convenient for Heathrow and a quiet oasis so near to such a busy location. Room service top notch. 
4; Stunning hotel matched by the excellent standard and attitude of their staff. They consistently went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, and were polite and knowledgeable. The hotel itself is beautifully appointed and the room was spacious and comfortable. As other reviewers have said, the room provided all the equipment you might need - hairdryers, ironing board etc - and was very quiet given its location. We both slept very well and were offered a complimentary newspaper in the morning. We were staying one night for my Wife's birthday (went to see a musical at the Apollo) and the hotel suprised us with a little birthday cake for her, which was a lovely touch. The next day the hotel let us stash our bags whilst we explored the local area, which is easy as everything seems to be a 20 minute walk from Victoria! Overall I thought it excellent value (admittedly we had found a discounted rate online) and wouldnt hesitate to stay there again. 
4; Went to Brighton for the first time on a stag weekend and chose the hotel for location and price so before arriving my expectations was not high as i only wanted a bed for a few hours between drinking sessions. Well all i can say is if jmy expectations was high it would have still been met as i found the place the location and omre importantly the staff to be an absolute pleaseure from start to finish. Yes the place is old and of course maintanance must be ongoing on a large old building like this and if you looked hard enough you will be able to pick fault but thats ony if you are sad and got nothing else to do. this is a clean place with lots of character but what makes any place for me is the staff who here could not do enough for you! every one pleasant , helpful and had your best interests at heart all the time. This you will find from the top with the manager to Calre Sylvester to Racheal on the reception and the lovely women at breakfasts how starts your day with a warm glow. Speaking of breakfast you cant fault it !! This is not the Grand but it is not Grand prices and to be honest I would be here any day. if it is a clean warm welcoming hotel with a great central location then look no further. Well done Old Ship and more so well done to the staff that make the place. Regards a bunch from nottingham on a stag party 
4; A great hotel, wonderful room with all the disabled facilities you could wish for. The service in the restaurant was top class and the overall experience was 1st class. Highly recommended for disabled people 
4; Stayed for one night in June, clean rooms, hearty buffet breakfast and lovely staff. The hotel was busy when I stayed, but I was still made to feel special and would recommend a stay here to anyone. Easy access to A12. Be careful,with postcode and satnav as it might leave you on the A12. 
4; A new and vibrant hotel in an excellent position, on the waterfront and close to the city centre. Staff were friendly and the hotel appeared to be very efficiently run. Will definitely use this hotel again for my next stay in Lincoln. 
4; We have an overnight stay in Newcastle every 6 weeks or so to wind down. Of all the hotels we use, the Vermont is the best. Always a nice reception, rooms very warm and the beds are so comfortable. Great location and car parking available on site. It's the best for the price. 
4; Both the hotel & restaurant are superb, the staff are very attentive and actually want to help nothing is too much trouble, we would not definitely stay here again and the restaurant is really good, the  variation of different types of Asian cuisine is highly recommended.   
4; Very pleasant, helpful and polite staff. Excellent clean rooms and fantastic breakfast. Great facilities. Superb situation for the city and very easily found. Brilliant. 
4; Stayed in Norwich for a few nights. The price was a little more than we wanted to pay, however, we were glad we made the choice. Stayed in the Queen Elizabeth room, really is worth the money. The hotel is old and has its own character, far better than the big chains. The restaurant was very good. Food and service was excellent. The local wine is worth a try. 
4;The hotel was to an excellent standard and very friendly staff. Its an excellent base for sightseeing in London, with The Tower of London only 5 minutes walk away and the Tower Hill tube station on the circle line closer still. We didn't have breakfast in the restaurant but we had drinks in the very swish bar. Overall, excellent and I would recomment it to anyone wanting to stay in London. 
4; Arrived to find we had been upgraded from a de-luxe to a river view room (109) great view of the river and bridge. More compact than the rooms we've had in past but then the view more than made up for a few feet of space,not that we spend a great deal of time in the room. This like a lot of the hotel now refurbished to a high standard, even the residents lounges have had the treatment and look superb, this year a total of 12 of us stayed for 3/2 nights some of our party have been coming for the past ten years, again local parties making use of dining in what must be the best restraunt in Barnstaple and glad to say the same faces were there to greet us again speaks volumes that the hotel keeps it staff year after year. The food as always superb and service you receive in the dining room first class, lot of hard work goes into making this the best in the area and after coming here for a few years now and knowing some of the staff they really enjoy their jobs as much as we enjoy coming, partly due I expect to it being family run with everyone knowing each other right from management down to housekeeping, yes once again a enjoyable stay as always will look forward to our next visit. 
4; I've stayed twice at the recently opened Hilton hotel in Bournemouth. The staff were very friendly, the rooms modern, well equipped and clean and overall I would rate this hotel for anyone staying in the area on business or leisure.  The gym, pool and spa have to rate as one of the best in the UK I have encountered of late. The gym is spacious with up to date modern equipment and good air conditioning. The pool is huge (for a hotel) - feels like its around 20m long so good if like me you like to swim a few lengths. The spa is also reasonably priced and the staff there were very friendly and helpful.  The top floor Skybar has excellent views over the town although maybe my expectations of the Bournemouth skyline at night were too high as I was left somewhat underwhelmed by the view (once you seen Manhattan at night everything else so of misses the mark!). Anyhow the service was quick and the atmosphere nice - plus they had a good range of wines, beers and spirits. Food options in the bar are more limited (mainly tapas and sharing dishes), however the main Schpoons & Forks restaurant on the ground floor more than makes up for that. It's not cheap but the food is freshly cooked in an open to the seating area kitchen. My business partner and I both opted for the steak, which were excellent along with the red wine recommended to go with it.  The hotel is well placed in the centre of the town and near the beach. 
4;From booking to check out the Nadler was an excellent choice. Communication was outstanding, warm and friendly greeting. Room (superior double) was bright, clean and well fitted out with a kitchenette and Nespresso coffee machine. Bed was big and comfy, power shower excellent. Staff were very helpful and happy to be working at the Nadler. I was certainly happy staying there! I also reserved one of the 2 car parking spaces which was really convenient. Earl's Court tube a 3 minute walk away, some nice eateries nearby too. Well worth a visit!
4; I have stayed in this hotel four or five times in the past few months and I really enjoy the experience. The rooms are smart and clean (if on the cosy side), the breakfasts an experience in themselves (I find visions of their eggs benedict keep me going on my morning runs) that will sustain you past lunchtime, but the highlight of each stay is the quality of the service offered by each and every member of the staff – they really do make the difference to one’s stay.  During my last stay for example, I was impressed at how Dyllan managed my check in. Not only was he polite to a fault, but he went over and above to make sure that my check in experience went smoothly, escorted me to my room when my first keycard did not work and then followed up with a call a few minutes later to ask if everything was in order… I find it is little touches like that that make one feel welcome in a hotel! 
4; The hotel is large and modern. The greeting and check out done sat down, no queueing at a desk which makes a nice change. Room excellent, went for a look at the gym but could not get in. The hotel lives up to its 4 start rating. Access = it is very near the revamped Albert Dock and a short walk from town. Nice in good weather but could be pretty uncomfortable in bad weather. No car parking at the hotel - we chose not to take a car and apart from the comment above we felt this was a good decision. Lots of eateries nearby so we didn't use the restaurant or bar, which looked standard large hotel places. 
4; Booked via the web, dinner bed and breakfast, not cheap but well worth it. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, lots of smiles. The food was excellent, Chateaubriand the first night and a very enjoyable taster menu for the second, neither cheap, but again well worth it. Breakfast, just as good. Do I recommend The Black Swan, most definitely, will I return, I hope so as there's a lot to see in the local area. 
4;" Lovely hotel tucked quietly into the busy Shepherds Bush area. Great for a shopping trip to Westfield and for having fun in West London. Room was spacious and the staff friendly and available. Much cleaner than other central London hotels and doesn't have that &quot;worn&quot; feeling. Only downside was that my quoted rate was excluding VAT and that always comes as an unwelcome shock when checking out! "
4; Stayed here recently as I was taking part in the Great Birmingham run. It's very centrally located, near all the shops. It does not have its own car park but there is an NCP round the corner that does special rates for residents, £8, for 24 hours.  Reception was quick, efficient and friendly.  The room was a decent size, comfy bed, and all very well maintained. A decent buffet breakfast in included in the price.  Overall it suited our needs perfectly and if I was staying in Brum again I would definitely consider staying her again. 
4; A lovely hotel within a few minutes walk to the town centre. Very clean and excellent service. No restaurant but you can order room service from the Thai restaurant next door. The room had plenty of space for a cot bed and the hotel staff had the foresight to remove the table and chairs from the room before we arrived to give as much room as possible. We would definitely stay again if we find ourselves in Peterborough again. 
4; Stayed overnight when in Bournemouth overnight for work. Double room was clean and tidy with a very comfy bed and fast wifi. Enjoyed lunch in the garden (can recommend the club sandwich) Staff were polite and helpful. Special thanks to Rod who helped us with our luggage and directions towards town. Would be happy to stay again next time I'm in Bournemouth. 
4;I always choose to stay here when working in Leeds and in my opinion the Clayton Hotel is the most convenient place to stay in the centre of Leeds offering excellent quality for what you pay. You're literally a minute from the M621 (Jct 3) and the hotel has an excellent car park that isn't overpriced. You can walk into the centre of Leeds in 5 minutes. I've stayed at other major hotel chains in Leeds but they seem to lack atmosphere and parking has always been tight and awkward. The Clayton hotel offers a great bar, never had to complain about the food either and they always show the major sport events which is a bonus. The restaurant has always served a great buffet breakfast and dinner, again no complaints. The staff are always very helpful and a special thanks to James on reception and the girls in reservations who always go out of their way to help you. The 8th floor offers a small gym and Executive rooms are located here (£10? extra) these are spacious, always clean and offer extras such as spring water, washing gels, and bathrobes. Rooms on the other floors are always clean and tidy, I have no complaints given the price. From my experience, if you don't book early they're usually full and that for me is a great indicator of quality. Thanks guys!
4; Although the bar area was very very busy and noisy (understandably being the best pub around) the restaurant was a haven of peace. The menu was varied and extensive, the wine list more than adequate and the service spot on. A perfect night, and all at a reasonable price with no hurry to throw us out .(even though it got after midnight). Scallops, lamb and some nice wine... perfect meal in excellent company 
4; My spouse and I had a wonderful weekend at this hotel. It is very conveniently located to the center of town and the RSC. The hotel is certainly well-cared for as everything was clean and fresh. Lastly, the staff was excellent. Specifically, we left some mobile chargers in the room and the staff sent them to us, via postal mail, for no extra charge. Thank you for that! We highly recommend the Crown Plaza! 
4; Just across the road from Meadfoot beach. Indoor and Outdoor Pool are great. No problem with parking (plenty of space at the rear of the hotel if the front is full). Good food. Friendly helpful staff.  Lovely grounds with fantastic views. Charles Darwin stayed there. Nice walk to Kents Cavern and Ilsham Marine Drive. Convenient bus serice into town (easier than parking)  Half an hour from Dartmoor. Canoeing at Ansty Cove 
4;Just returned from two nights at this hotel and had great comfort and service. The hotel is very nicely situated and the staff are first class. It has a lovely garden in the middle with kio carp in an attractive pond. The full English is exactly what is says with proper bacon and not turkey slices as in some establishments.Will return.
4; We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of January as breakaway club members, in a QStar Double Room. we had asked for a King Bed when booking the room but when we got there it was only a double bed. We had a member of staff who helped us and he was called David Walker, he was so helpful, really nice, couldn't do enough to make sure your stay was the very best, (so thanks David for all your help). If i have to moan and i really don't like to, it would be that we was only down for 1 nights stay, so the 2nd day our key card cut off leaving us outside our room locked out, with no telephones on the 8th floor corridor to phone down, it meant going back to reception to change the key card. Another luxury i liked about the Qstar room was the turn down service they offer, we have stayed in other hotels that offer this too, but unfortunately it was never done for the 2 nights of our stay. As we had the use of the 8th floor exec lounge, we knew there was newspapers in there, usually when you have a Q Star room you get a newspaper in your room of your choice, i was disappointed to find on both days only 2 newspapers available, both political papers. On the first evening i got makeup on my pillow, when the room was cleaned i was surprised that she left the pillow case on by turning the pillow over. The drinks in the Q Club are very good, but during the day there was only water, tea & coffee available, no other soft drinks like other hotels that have the exec lounge do. The staff are so lovely, and friendly from the reception staff, concierge, and restaurant staff. We will definatly stay again, Leeds is great for shopping. 
4; We had an excellent stay at the Royal Duchy hotel in Falmouth.  All credit to the staff for maintaining a high standard of service and making us feel so welcome.It was our first visit we look forward to our return.  
4; What can I say. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was perfect. We arrived at about 1pm to ask staff if we were able to park in the car park and they informed us that our room was ready to check in if we wish.   The room was number 4 at the top of the stairs, so was a little noisy from the restaurant downstairs but really didn't impact on our stay at all. The room has lovely amenities and is a great size too. The bed was super comfy with plenty of pillows so it is easy to make yourself at home.  Even though we didn't have a dinner reservation they made us feel really welcome and managed to squeeze us in. The food was outstanding, the service was 100% and despite being pregnant and not being able to eat certain foods, the staff were very accommodating and just couldn't fault them.  On checking out we had a lovely chat with a few of the receptionists who gave us some great advice on local walks and we ended up spending a few more hours in Old Amersham and exploring the countryside. Thanks for the tip!  Old Amersham as a town is beautiful and we will absolutely be heading back. And when we do we'll be staying at The Crown Inn. Thanks a lot for a lovely stay. 
4; We had a delux room overlooking the lake which we found very comfortable. Everything there including a welcome glass of port! We did not eat dinner here as we were visiting the area for a family re-Union but we did enjoy the breakfast. Good range of both cold and hot items. There was a wedding whilst we were there but it did not interfere with our stay at all. All the staff we encountered were very welcoming and pleasant. 
4;" My wife and I and our two friends returned to this delightful hotel which we &quot;found&quot; last year.  This might well become a very nice habit.  The rooms are great with fantastic beds and excellent an shower in the bathroom.  We stayed for 4 nights with dinner included and the food is beautifully prepared and cooked.  The only issue we had were that the menu stayed the same with only a few extra dishes of the day and we also would have liked a dish or two of extra vegetables in the evening between the four of us. Breakfast was a delight each day . We expect to return next year and enjoy the experience even more. "
4; This is a family owned hotel and you are made welcome from entering the front door. What can I say about the food that Liam and his team create, wonderful, exquisite, imaginative, SUPERB! And that's only the breakfast. DINNER has climbed to an even higher level.  The success appears to be that all the staff endeavour and reach a standard of excellence. 
4; We spent two nights at the Prince Rupert in January 2014 and I can honestly say I would return at the drop of a hat. The staff made sure we felt at home from the first minute we arrived and also upgraded our room to one of the suites{great touch} which where absolutely amazing. The location of the Hotel is probably the best in Shrewsbury nestling bang in the middle of Shrewsbury. If your going to Shrewsbury we can't endorse this Hotel enough. 
4; Me and my fiancé stayed in the sanctuary for a romantic mini break.  I was surprised at how friendly the staff were from arrival to departure! A true credit to the hotel as they couldn't do enough for us during our stay!  The room was outstanding!!!!  As soon as we arrived, there was champagne and chocolates awaiting with petals sprinkled over the bed to set the tone.  The heating and range of lighting was just right and added a very cozzy feel to the place.  The glass bath tub is amazing!! And best of all the hot tub outside was very swish with outdoor speakers to play your music from an iPod!!!!!  I was wowed at the choice of breakfast on the menu, as you could also have it in your room! I loved every minute of being here and would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a relaxing weekend away!  It's close to the centre where we ate at some lovely restaurants and walked peacefully to the lake.  This is definitely a good choice of hotel for a romantic getaway for two!!!! 
4; we stayed at the bloomsbury hotel for my wifrs 30th birthday weekend arriving on the friday and departing on the sunday. firstly the location is great. getting off the tube at tottenham court and walking up the steps to the dominion theatre you know you are in the heart of things. a few hundred yards of a walk leads you to this great hotel, in a quiet side street. on entering the hotel you get the wow factor with elegant surroundings and staff opening the doors for you. check in was simple and as we were early the consierge put our bags away and brought them to the room for us when it was ready. the rooms were big enough for what you get in london with a mini bar (charges applied) wide screen tv, wardrobe, ensuite, hairdryer and all the other bits you would expect. hotel bar was a bit expensive but you expect that in a place like this although not as dear as drinking in the south of ireland. atmosphere in the bar was great too. didnt eat here as we had dinner booked in claridges gordon ramsey restaraunt. just around the corner is oxford street which is busy but comfortable. i would recommend this place especially if you are going to oend a few hours around the hotel 
4; The hotel is off the main Earls Court Road less than 5 minutes walk from the tube station. It's a traditional town house which has been completely renovated and modernised inside - and decorated to a very high standard. The rooms are very small but with everything that you need. The bed is extremely comfortable - although it may be a tad short for anyone over 1.85m tall (about 6 foot) that likes to stretch out. I'm 1.85m tall and just fitted in comfortably.The showerroom is also a small area...but perfectly adequate and beautifully decorated. All of the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly. Breakfast is continental style...eggs, meats, cheeses, breads...all nice and fresh and plenty of it.  I really enjoyed the hotel - it's location, comfort, quietness and the modern, fresh decor and comfortable furnishings.  Definitely somewhere I'll stop again in the future. 
4; Great hotel, lovely staff and good food! Only downside is the location but that's our fault.   The room was spotless and had a great amount of space with good size bathroom. Also had a superb breakfast, not usually a fan of buffet style but they do it to perfection here!!  Like I said a bit of a trek to central London but will not mark down over that as we knew this when booking. 
4; We stayed at the Bristol in the night of a friend's wedding, the room had all the features you would expect from a room of this price, but we didn't feel short changed at all. The room was very clean, the bathroom and worktops were stunning and the breakfast in the morning was probably the best breakfast I've had in a hotel in this country. If you need a city centre hotel in Bristol and this is within your budget then you will not be disappointed! 
4;Our first time at the Lugger, having a long weekend over 3 nights. Looking at the photos on the web site when we arrived we were not disappointed and it truly is a perfect location for a getaway. We arrived a little early for check in and tried our luck at reception to see if the room was ready. We were warmly greeted by Richard on reception who made us both feel very welcome. We were shown to our room (101) which we would say is the best one to have, it has its own balcony with table and chairs and is right on the waters edge with perfect views. We ate at the hotel on two occasions, both faultless on food and service, breakfast was also of the same quality. Great location for walks along the coastal paths if you feel like stretching the legs and some very nice places to visit within 30 min drive. Local pub in Portloe (Ship Inn) also worth a drink and a bite to eat (book a table to be sure for eating), nice beer garden too. We have stayed in a number of top boutique hotels around the UK and overseas and the Lugger is up there at the top. It may not be the cheapest on price, but when you consider the location, food and service of the hotel it is worth it. We travelled down from Manchester for the long weekend and it was well worth the journey with us now checking our calendar for planning a return visit later in the year.
4; We were a little apprehensive after reading some reviews on here, but we had a great stay, nice big warm room and bathroom on first floor, good quality breakfast with plenty of choice. Also a very friendly cosy lounge bar for drinks. Ideally located in centre of town for restaurants and shops etc, no car parking issues as after a time you can park across rd from hotel, or a brisk walk to a £2 all day/ night park.Very friendly and helpful staff, definately would stay here again. 
4;" On the weekend of October 09, 2010, my daughter and son-in-law held their marriage ceremony and wedding party at Stoke Place.   We started at 16:00 with the ceremony and the party finished the next morning at 02:00. Everything was spectacular.  All my family members and every single one of our guests, many from abroad, were highly impressed with everything the staff did. It was all exceptional; this from the way the ceremony was set-up, to the way the hall was then converted for the party, from how every aspect of the service was carried out through to the quality of the food and the professionalism of the staff.  We have to highly commend the Conferencing and Banqueting Manager, Pete Redden, who was absolutely superb and went out of his way to make everything successful. He worked solidly for over 12 hours, professionally coordinating all activities and managing all the staff.  In addition, Holly Nicol, the Wedding Planner, arranged everything perfectly and, even though she recently joined the team at Stoke Place, she handled all pre-wedding arrangements to perfection. We also reserved several rooms in the hotel and the reception staff was also very professional and helpful.  Stoke Place should be very proud of its team and congratulations to all of them.  I am certain that many people will be interested in holding functions at the venue based on the number of compliments we received from all our guests. "
4; We stayed at this hotel on 17 October 2016 after finding this hotel on Sunday evening to go to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall the next night. Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and friendly fellow guests. Our bedroom and the bathroom were definitely 5 star hotel standard. We had the inclusive continental breakfast which was plentiful and served by engaged and friendly staff who actually seemed to enjoy their job. An amazing boutique hotel and we shall definitely become regulars when we have an evenings out in London. The reviews we read before booking were very helpful.. 
4; A pleasant surprise and exceed all expectations. Friendly and helpful staff, comfortable room, nice choice of food for lunch (also the afternoon teas looked really very good) and breakfast over looking the sea was a great way to start the day. A good all round experience. Only draw back was the parking, the sun was out, so the area was busy and the hotel had a wedding, so it took a while to park, although the hotel staff did their best to accommodate us and it wasn't the end of the world. 
4; This is a great well priced hotel for using as a base camp whilst visiting the Ironbridge museums and surrounding area particularly for the disabled traveler. The room we had had a well equipped bathroom for a wheelchair user. See photo's below.   The review is on the whole very positive. Unfortunately let down by a maintenance issue that wasn't corrected (see photo below). The hand rail alongside the toilet came off the wall. I reported this to reception and noticed a note being taken. That evening the rail was back in place and one assumed fixed. Sadly upon using it once again came off the wall and I almost took a nose dive straight into the nearby sink. Most people will reasonably have no idea of the life a disabled person lives and the importance and reliance upon said devices. As a paraplegic I like others solely rely on these handles and very nearly had a serious accident. The real sad story is that or that was required to secure this device was the use of an allen key (I am an engineer). A mere minute of an maintenance persons time. It seems the person whom attended this incident decided to just force the item back into it's socket without locking the allen nut to secure it. Total Incompetence. I strongly urge the hotel manager to visit this room and check that this handle is now secure as I somehow doubt it has been secured correctly. 
4;We called into the Hotel Felix for lunch on a very sunny Wednesday during the school holidays. We arrived just on 2pm and the kitchen was just closing the manger called the kitchen and they were more than happy to serve us.   We had a great lunch, the kids menu was brilliant and the garden was great for them to run about in. Our 2 girls loved the home made burgers. The food and service were great. My wife joking said we should stay and with that we asked if they had any rooms and booked in for the night into a suite so the whole family could share the room - they gave us a great deal on B&B.   The hotel also sorted out some discounted punting tickets - which was great fun and highly recommended - the guided one rather than the DIY one.   We fed the girls an early tea in Cambridge at a lovely Italian and then we had a lovely relaxed gown up dinner back at the hotel. A great last minute short holiday!   Great place, people and service.
4; Eight of us recently stayed in the hotel for a long weekend golf break. The golf course was in excellent condition and a real test. The rooms were really comfortable with everything you would expect from a four star hotel. Great amenities with pool, spa, sauna and gym. The food was tasty and the staff really friendly. Cannot fault it. We took a look at the adjoining lodges which are ideal for groups and we will definitely be booking one of these next time. 
4;"I've just been on the Festival of the 60's weekend and it was great. It's years since I've been to any Butlins site and I'm very impressed with what they've done at Minehead. I stayed in one of their West Lake chalets. These are very new and are immaculate. Everything was spotless.   All of the staff were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  The entertainment consisted of Tribute Bands and also original bands (now pretty ancient). By and large the music was exactly what you would expect at such a weekend, and it was great fun dressing up in all the &quot;rocker&quot; gear.   We heard hits of the The Searchers, Edison Lighthouse, The Animals, The Dakotas and others.   Great Entertainment!! The music they played was really good and gets you going down Memory Lane.   The only blot on the landscape here was Lulu who seemed not to understand what a sixties weekend was all about. She was more concerned with plugging her latest CD (all self-penned she told us) than singing her oldies.   After a couple of her latest songs, we bailed out (along with many others) and decided go to another venue where some real rock'n'roll was being played.  There were several thousand people at this gig and the organisation at the music venues was very good.  So, a perfect weekend (almost)."
4; The hotel is a few yards from the river and very convenient for centre of Cambridge.It is a modern hotel with funky decor.  We had a room on the 5th floor with a balcony.Sadly it was hurling down with rain so we could not use it but the views and light into the room were great.  The thing we liked about the place were the staff: they could not have been more helpful and friendly.   A whole bunch of us arrived at the same time with bikes: we had done the London to Cambridge ride and they coped with us, our kit and bikes with no fuss.  We had dinner and cocktails in the River Bar and again the staff could not have been more accommodating. The steaks were great too and the pricing was not spiteful  The only negative was that some of the party who came by car had problems with the SatNav and the Cambridge one way system to get there but that is nothing to with the hotel.They do valet parking. 
4; Absolutely amazing hotel, real luxury. Excellent location with amazing views over the docks. The staff were all really friendly and the breakfast was 5*.   would highly recommend for a couples getaway to Liverpool.   Luckily when we went the sun was shining, short walk to Liverpool one and Albert dock. 
4;A must to stay when in London. Beautiful and very comfortable hotel for business, holiday and family get aways. The staff is a delight and make guests feel special. No question this is a 5 star hotel but affordable. My stay wasn't planned but relocated from another hotel after an unfortunate area power failure. The AMBA was amazing accepting 150 unexpected guests with exceptional organization and speed, with the assurance they would make every guest welcome and very comfortable in their exceptional rooms. The staff's top priority was making every guest comfortable and to make their stay an exceptional experience. They delivered on that promise. I would not hesitate to recommend AMBA to anyone, and will return for another stay soon.
4; We also stayed in room 1. It was fine and clean. Nice shower and lovely and quiet - just woke to birds singing!. Bed was comfy and the staff were very helpful and supplied sausage sandwiches on request! Very good value and would like to return soon! 
4; A wonderfully designed boutique hotel in Helmsley. A great location. The heated outdoor pool and hot tub, in the central court yard, with all the comfy loungers dotted about the pool area, really make this place the perfect chill out weekend destination. Our room over looking the pool was large, comfy and well fitted. The bar area is contemporary and a great place to loose yourself in a big comfy chair. The restaurant is nice and trendy but the food served by the restaurant is only nice. Breakfast is superb. Staff very friendly. The Spa looks great but did not use it. Not cheap but certainly worth it. 
4; Stayed in the Ramada Southport for a second time with the family. Chose one of the suite rooms as a treat. Everything about the stay was perfect, including the room, reception, staff and restaurant. Free use of the pool at the nearby gym too. Although the pool is a bit dated, it's a good option to have. 
4; Groupon deal- £120 for 2 nights B+B. Tastefully decorated and the decked area to the rear with views over the harbour is not to be missed. Obviously highly respected amongst the local elite. The rooms have everything you need and are tasteful and clean, mattress and beds are great and offered a good nights sleep.Breakfast cooked to order.  approx 4 miles into Poole and Bournemouth, Poole Harbour is smart and some great Pubs and restaurants.  Would certainly use again 
4; I have stayed here a couple of times now and had a really good stay. The staff are nice and the food is excellent. They have their own farm for their meats which is good and the pork belly that I had for dinner on the second visit was amazing. If the weather is good there is a nice garden with the river at the bottom, really nice. 
4; Fantastic Hotel, I've stayed here 3 times, ideal location for Central London. Friendly hotel staff and efficient service on check in and check out. Great room, can be slightly noisy if front facing rooms. Very clean. Decor great, newly rennovated. Definitely would recommend and stay again!!!! Breakfast on the go is a great idea!! A happy customer!! :-) 
4; I've stayed here three times in as many months, its great! The staff are informative, helpful and have nailed service with a smile. Hats off to the Chef/'s because food is excellent, each and every time, it represents value for money with an inclusive booking and your waitress Billie is an asset to the team! 
4;"Fantastically placed for the West End without being right in it. Stayed here and went to the Colliseum (English National Opera, straight down the road; also very handy for the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden). Friendly professional staff, well decorated rooms (not the biggest, but it's central London).   Also check out the Lebanese restaurant, right over the road and open until late."
4; We picked it as we were going to Bletchley Park with my mother who was a Japanese Code Breaker there during the war. Friendly staff, good location, great room and very quiet. Perfect central MK hotel at a good price. 
4; Really nice atmosphere, lovely spacious rooms, friendly staff, clean throughout and the building has lots of character with lots of historic features. Evening bbq buffet could have been a little better as not much choice and bread was very dry but breakfast was brilliant. Highly recommend 
4; The excellent rating is simply for Kirstie the reception manager, who looked after us in an unfortunate situation. She went out of her way to ensure our happiness without crossing the line, and done all she could to ensure our satisfaction. Thank you! 
4; I stayed for one night, and I could not fault the hotel. The dinner at the Marco restaurant was excellent. The room was new, clean and very comforable. I really liked the 'wet room' and standard. Ver y resonably priced and staff couldn't help more. I will use the hotel again. Very impressed. 
4;We have stayed at this hotel many times in the past. This time-before and after a flight to Cuba, it seemed much more reasonably-priced than before. the room (as always) was very clean. Special thanks to Philip on reception who sorted out our two consecutive nights` stay on return, each night booked with a different provider and to the courtesy van driver who was particularly helpful. The restaurant staff were all lovely! You must try the Fish and Chips! Battered fish quite exceptionally beautifully cooked by their young chef-if the chips had been Home-made-this would have been epic. MUCH nicer than the rooms at Jury`s Inn-well worth the small premium!
4; I booked two nights as a present for my fiance's birthday after reading some very good reviews on here. We were not disappointed in the slightest. From check in to check out the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we felt very well looked after. We dined in the excellent bistro on the first night and the food and Portuguese wine recommended to us by the sommelier was so good we made a note of it! Breakfast was also very tasty with a great selection, the smoked haddock was particularly good. Our room was a superior and it was huge with a fantastic shower and roll top bath. The hotel is lovely inside and has great parking at the back. After we checked out we had plans to do some more sightseeing and head to the superb Jorvik Viking Centre and the hotel were more than happy to let us leave the car there which we thought was excellent. Thank you to the whole Hotel Du Vin York team for a very relaxing and pleasurable stay. We will be coming back! 
4; Definitely recommended. Friendly staff and excellent food. Rooms were extremely clean and well maintained. Reception staff were so understanding of our unusual situation (we were staying there last minute due to a fault with the apartment we were supposed to be saying in). Definitely stay here! 
4; This beautifully positioned hotel near St Ives -delivers what it promises. Stylish and comfortable on one of the best sandy beaches in the country. Guests who choose self-catering cottages or apartments can use the hotel facilities which gives a lot of flexibility with children (dogs too). Friendly staff, warm pool and Jacuzzi together with a new spa -what's not to like! 
4; GREAT HOTEL, FIRST CLASS ROOMS WITH ALL up-to-the-minute AMENITIES. Very nice restaurant with a first-rate breakfast and dinner. Positively recommend this hotel and would cheerfully stay again. Excellent value for money. 
4; I booked our 4 night stay in April having stayed at the hotel twice before albeit 15 years ago. We were advised before we arrived that the hotel will be covered in scaffolding due to the winter storms. When we arrived, check in was fast and efficient and we went up to our room, which was perfect for myself and the 2 kids. I said, I would unpack and then we could go down to the swimming pool. We did but found out that children are not allowed in before 2:30 which was fine, so we went back to them room. I then discovered there was no fridge, but a quick call resulted in a fridge being delivered. The food was 1st class. There was always a choice of meat, poultry, fish, vegetarian and pasta for dinner. The kids really enjoyed it and decided not to eat off the children’s menu. Likewise breakfast had a huge choice and we only saw a queue once. Some of the reports I had read referred to dirty rooms and bathrooms. I can’t comment other than to say mine was spotless, The staff were very friendly, from the reception, restaurant and cleaning staff.   The location was good with a tram stop outside the hotel. We did walk to the Tower on the first day but then used the trams which were good value for money.  If I had to make any criticisms they would be 1. The room was too hot even though the heating was off 2. Some drawer space would have been nice for clothes in the huge wardrobe.  Would I stay at the hotel again. YES. Would I recommend the hotel. YES 
4; We stayed at the Manor House last weekend and found the double room comfortable and clean with all the facilities you need and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The bar and restaurant areas had a good atmosphere and the poached eggs for breakfast were cooked perfectly. 
4;We don't live that far from Chester and have visited a few times before mostly for shopping. As we were planning a few days away we decided to stay overnight to enjoy the city in the evening.  The Crowne Plaza proved to be an excellent choice. The location is a very short walk from the city centre (it's right around the corner), parking was very convenient on site, however there is a large car park across the road if the hotel is full. I'm a platinum member with IHG and we were made very welcome with a room upgrade on arrival, the check in was very smooth and the reception staff were very helpful with ideas to fill our time in the city. The room was comfortable with a huge bed and all the amenities you expect from this standard of hotel. We didn't dine at the hotel on this occasion but the food we saw being served looked delicious, the following mornings breakfast was excellent the buffet was extensive and it is possible to order a la carte items in addition to this. Checking out was also a very pleasant experience, the staff, as with all the others were polite without being fussy which led to a very relaxed atmosphere. We will certainly visit Chester again and use this hotel. Another thing to note is that it is also only a short walk to the racecourse ( which we overlooked from our room), so maybe you could stay there for free .......if your horse comes in!
4; We stayed at the Hilton primarily for easy access to the airport but generally we enjoyed the stay which we had extended by one further day. We hadn't stayed at a Hilton for a while having experiences some weakening in the brand following acquisitions in the UK a few years ago. 
4; Very nice hotel. The food was great and the friendliness shown by all the staff whilst remaining very professional was a breath of fresh air. The room was very clean and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend this hotel 
4; Wonderful period Country Manor House. Off the beaten track - but worth the effort to find this lovely Hotel. Very comfortable and staff welcoming and helpful. Dine and stay in style - to the Manor born! 
4; Beautiful Hotel in lovely grounds. We were made very welcome on arrival and given a suite which was spotless and very comfortable. The whole stay was great and the evening meal fantastic. If you are looking for a nice relaxing break beautifully decorated and tasteful then i strongly recommend this hotel. 
4;We first visited here a couple of years ago and were suprised that the owners recoginised us on our return visit on the 14th December 2013 with my wifes parents. We had such a good experience on our first visit, we were hoping we would not be disappointed ..... We were not!  The food was beautiful, the service was polite, efficient and friendly. The young chef's obviously work hard in the kitchens to produce quality food like they do and we will certainly not be leaveing it as long to return.
4;We spent a two night stay at the hotel as a surprise birthday treat. ALL the hotel staff were helpful, friendly and courteous and the use of the heated pool and spa were a bonus that we readily took advantage of. Next time, I shall probably venture into the gym as well
4; Apex temple court is probably a hotel you would not think to stay in but it's a loverly strole from the back entrance onto fleet street and to Leicester Square or Covent Garden or even the west end I think we have found a little gem for location and hotel itself great room great facilities and good continental breakfast to boot will be going back without question! !! Mr and the new mrs smith 
4;We picked this hotel for our stay on New Years in London! The hotel was very clean and modern. The rooms were plenty big enough with very good bathroom facilities and very comfy bed!! The location was perfect as it is very close to The Shard, London Bridge and Tower Bridge tube station which was perfect for transportation. Only down problem was that there is no car park, but about 600 yards up the road there is a car park which is payable. We had a great view of The Shard from our room which is what we requested. Overall we have a brilliant stay and recommend and would go back!!
4; My wife and I were looking for a hotel in Bournemouth where we could celebrate my 80th Birthday and our 25th Wedding anniversary. After an extensive search we chose this hotel and last weekend most of our family stayed from Friday to Sunday. On Saturday 35 of us enjoyed a superb meal. The premises were of high quality, the staff could not by faulted, the food was excellent and we would recommend it to anyone.   Barry V 
4; Recently refurbished to an excellent standard, whilst maintaining its rich heritage. Fantastic room, good size, well appointed. Can't comment on the restaurant, etc., as I spent all my time walking around Bath.   The simple fact is, I would return to this hotel and can't recommend it enough. 
4;The hotel is well placed near to Ealing Common tube station and also near to Ealing Broadway and Ealing itself. The hotel room was very comfortable and clean and very well appointed. Great free coffee and cookies
4; Booked a picnic in the gardens for my wife's birthday. It was absolutely excellent food with perfectly timed waiting staff sat next to the waterfall on a sunny day. Boy was I in he good books!! 
4; Overall a very enjoyable experience. Staff very attentive, cleanliness of hotel and rooms excellent, food very well prepared and presented. Ample lifts which were very reliable. A great location for visiting The Stadium or The SSE Arena. 
4; Stayed at various Malmaisons up and down the UK and my favourites are Newcastle and Leeds. The decor is alway spot on and the lighting is cleverly done. The ffod is always good and the rooms a lovely with great bathroom and quirky layout. We had complimentary chockys and flowers and bubbly in our room and even got a free music CD to take home. 
4; Lovely rooms, very clean and spacious, breakfast great with a superb choice, extremely friendly and helpful staff. This hotel is a joy to stay at. This is our second stay and we would not hesitate to return. London Bridge is a vibrant area of London with Borough Market 200yds away. Great for a long weekend! 
4;This was a lovely hotel set just outside Thame, it had a lovely Restaurant and nice bar area. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. The staff were all very pleasant and were eager to make your stay very pleasant.
4; We took a four day break at this hotel in April. It is a large house which has had the benefit of several extensions which make the internal layout a little quirky but neverthe less, adds to its charm. We had a good sized double room with an excellent sea view towards Constantine Bay which has a delightful beach and is only a few minutes walk away. The food was excellent and the staff smart, attentive, friendly and helpful. We took advantage of the small indoor swimming pool where we also enjoyed the jacuzzi There is also a spa, although we did not take advantage of it.  The atmosphere in the hotel is quiet, calm and serene and ideal for the relaxing break we were looking for. 
4; Room 503 studio deluxe with great view of the Barbican and lovely rood terrace. Breakfast in bed was great, nice relaxed low-key service, lovely room with thoughtful extras. This was our wedding night and couldn't think of a better place to spend it, will definitely be going back. 
4; This hotel complex gets better each time we visit great golf course superb staff and great rooms plus great food and all at reasonable prices the pool and hot tub just great and the local village pub serves several real ales greatb 
4; The staff were exceptional. Reception, dinner, breakfast. The room, with balcony. Swimming pool. My stress levels are quite high. I could of walked in there and been an idiot. I just let the staff take care of me. And, they really do take care of you. The waiter took dessert up to your room. I sat in the bar at 5am, watching the swans swim, in the middle of the golf course. We got an offer from the hotel. You do pay for your service, but I would recommend this hotel. 
4; Me and my partner stayed here for my 21st this weekend. It is a wonderful hotel, everything is beautifully clean, and the bed was the comfiest I have ever slept on. They even had a bottle of wine, and a big bunch of flowers waiting for me in the room arranged by the partner.  We would most defiantly stay again :) 
4; Hotel was beautiful, food was great and staff were brilliant! Charlotte (I think!) on reception was excellent and even offered to carry my very heavy bags to the room (Including bikes and triathlon gear). Gym was good too!  Would stay here without any hesitation! 
4; Stayed here for our 4th Wedding Anniversary Sat 13th June, had stayed previously so had a good idea what to expect and wasn't disappointed. Stayed in the Cavendish Suite in the private lodge which was exceptional value considering the standard. As expected given the time of year there was a wedding on and was made aware of this at the time of booking, but apart from the main hotel being a little busier and the restaurant being a bit busier this had no affect. The meal in Oscars resaurant was once again excellent with absolutely nothing to pick up. Booking a table prior to arrival is essential though due to its popularity. Was unable to hear anything from the function on returning to our room, but being in the seperate lodge helped with this. Staying on a previous occasion we could hear the function, but only just, and this ended promptly at midnight. Very comfortable and well rested nights sleep. Delicious breakfast, delivered to the room complimentary in an attempt to ease congestion at the resaurant due the the guest from the previous evenings function. Well thought out and planned. Staff were incredibly polite and helpful throughout the stay. Especially Michelle who was running the Bar and Restaurant area.  Generally outstanding (AGAIN), wife very happy and therefore so am I. Will definitely be back.  Many thanks  Mr + Mrs McCaffrey 
4;" Almost impossible to fault this place. The staff seem to really understand customer service; brilliant location; lovely restaurant and lounge areas. Standard rooms are perhaps a little cramped. Overall excellent value for what it offers. "
4; We had our wedding here in May 2013 and stayed two nights as a large group.  We cannot thank the staff enough for their help with the planning of the wedding/weekend and for helping to make everything run so smoothly. Everything was so organised and they made the whole weekend perfect. We had a private room the night before the wedding and also the morning after so our group could all eat together. The food was lovely and the service fantastic! We also used the golf and spa facilities in the day and would highly recommend this.  On the wedding day the staff did an amazing job and took any worries away - we couldn't have asked for anything more.  The setting was also ideal for photos and the package we had was really good value for money.   This really is the perfect setting with excellent staff for a wedding!! 
4; Highly recommend this hotel. Stayed here for 3 nights and could not find any fault. Check in was fast and the staff were very friendly and helpful full of information. Rooms were a good size and spotlessly clean. Food was excellent in the restaurant, they also had a good wine list and a great range of cocktails. Booked to go back again in June and we cant wait . 
4; I got upgraded to Executive Suite and WOW what a room, room was excellent, and the View was Awesome O2 Arena and Canary Wharf in view. Excellent location Staff very friendly and very helpful. The Concierge managed to find a restaurant with a table on Valentines Day Evening. 
4; This is the second time I've stayed here, the staff are very helpful, rooms very clean and spacious and breakfast has everything you need. The hotel is in a great location to get to lots of the local activities and shops.I will be back next year. 
4; The exterior very impressive. Staff very welcoming and professional. Dining room is sensational and the whole hotel has a historical feel. Our room No15 was however right at the top of the hotel - probably the maids quarters originally. There are no lifts and the top stairs are steep and narrow. We paid a very reasonable price for our 2 nights so couldn't really complain. If you have trouble with stairs [as does my wife] then make sure you have a lower room. The hotel tried to find us an alternative but they were fully booked [unsurprisingly]. Go visit!! 
4; Have a wonderful 2 night stay here last week for my Husband's 30th birthday. The staff were wonderfully attentive and even arranged a birthday cake to be in our room on arrival as a surprise for him.  The grounds were spectacular and we're both looking forward to going back in the summer months so we can enjoy the garden at it's best. And also meet the hotel cat which we heard so much about but didn't manage to meet.  The food in the restaurant was some of the best we have ever eaten and I could happily have eaten the fillet of beef for every meal. The flavours and attention to detail on each course was second to none. The dessert was a work of art in itself.  We booked a Queen Hall room which was just wonderful. Warm and cosy with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was out of this world with a large roll top bath, shower big enough for two and underfloor heating. It's safe to say that not all hotel bathrooms are created equal. If I could have slipped it in my pocket to take home with us, I would have done. :)  My only disappointment was the cake in the room. I had asked for chocolate cake with ganache which arguably we got. However the sponge was over cooked (burnt on the edges) and was far outweighed by the amount of sickly ganache. It was like eating a bitter dry lump of lard. Such a contrast to the amazing food in the restaurant. 
4;This is a very nice hotel. We stayed in an executive room. The front of the hotel is nice. But there is no car park but they let you park for free in airport car park 3. The staff are very friendly. In our room the toilet was not in the bathroom when you come in there is a door and it is in there.
4; i have stayed jere on numerous occasions and it has never disappointed me, lovely surroundings and sofas to relax and enjoy a drink or read a paper. Staff polite and professional. rooms are nice and the breakfast room is attractive and spaciouswith a good selection of cereals and fruit juices and what I like the most about the breakfast is the fact they come and take your order at the table and your breakfast is cooked fresh to order and delivered to you rather than the usual serve your self buffet which I find the food drys out and not the best. it is under going a refurb so I can only imagine it will be even better but please don't change the way you serve the hot breakfasts and go buffet style. all in all a good hotel for the price, value for money. 
4;Really good service and location, to closed to Sn Pancras station. Night staff totally hepful and useful. Very comfortable facilities and environment. Amazing bed quality. Absolutly advisable. abcdefghijklllmnñopqrrrstuvwxyz
4; Two of us were lucky to be going on a golf trip followed immediately by a skiing trip. This meant staying on two separate nights with lots of sports gear. The staff couldn't have been more helpful.They looked after our gear whilst we were away on each of the trips and the pick up and drop of service to the airport was second to none. We literally only had to wait five minutes each time to be picked up. 
4; Beautiful hotel, excellent service, lovely location. Great range of dining options - casual bistro in the spa, smart dining in the restautant as well as 4 big lounges with open fires which serve everything from afternoon tea, to bar meals and cocktails. Hotel is set in large grounds which are ideal for a leisurely stroll and the hotel is in the middle of ashdown forest with options for walking, running, cycling or visiting country pubs. 
4; My wife and I stayed at the Strozzi Palace for our wedding anniversary,. We booked the Sienna Suite, wonderful spacious room, elegant furnishings' luxury fittings,nd fixtures. It included continental breakfast which consisted of croissants, fruit, cereal, yogurts' mixed cheeses and meats. All items were from Marks and Spencer's.  It is very central , easily accessible , and very close to a number of good restaurants. We will be looking forward to staying with them again, fabulous place to stay. 
4;" Offered a family size room for the price of a double (room 506) Awesome sea view of pier, beach, channel, lower town. Balcony. Lovely Art Deco features. Beautiful tyme restaurant with first class service. Receptionist the nicest. Anybody thinking of a visit to Bournemouth would do well to give the &quot;central &quot; a try "
4; Orestone Manor is tucked away in a beautiful corner of Devon and the hotel has spectacular views over the sea. The hotel almost has a colonial feel to it and has some fantastic quirky furniture. Our room was very comfortable and the staff very friendly and helpful. The hotel restaurant is of a high quality with only the slight issue being that the portions are on the small side for anyone with a large appetite! That said, the draft Peroni at the well stocked bar made up for that! 
4; I have stayed at this hotel for the last 10 years, my wife and i always enjoy the piece full atmosphere at this hotel.  Saturday night are sometimes a problem with the noise from the wedding guest. Other than that a great hotel 
4; This is our fifth warners break and our first at cricket st Thomas. We booked it to coincide with my husbands birthday and from start to finish it has been faultless. The drive down to the hotel is lovely and gives you a stunning view of the house. We had a signature room in the walled garden. It was clean, comfortable and warm and had everything we needed. We ate our meals in the Granary restaurant which was perfect for us. It had a nice atmosphere, the staff were really lovely and looked after us well and the food was super, plenty of choice, well presented and tasty. Entertainment on both nights was great especially the motown group, The Gillettes. We will definitely book another trip to cricket st Thomas. 
4;My brother moved to Rye last year and I have since visited the town a couple of times and eaten at The George twice. My brother and his wife eat here regularly and have always praised the food very highly. I can honestly say their praise is worthy - lovely ambience, excellent staff and service and the food is amazing quality at really good prices - can't fault it.
4; Once again I have stayed at the Arden Hotel for the second Christmass and received a very warm welcome by all from reception,management,and all the staff. The room I was in was very comfortable,meals were excellent well prepared and very outstanding,Chef well done.To All thank you all for a lovely time always recommend you and a happy new year to all.Geoff Smith. 
4; I stayed here with my wife for one night (Saturday), as we were going for a night out with my staff at a near by restaurant. We have stayed here a number of times.  We were offered a harbour side room, or an inside facing room. We were advised that the harbour side rooms may be noisy on the Saturday evening. This is because on the opposite side of the harbour there are a lot of bars and restaurants, with Saturday being the busiest night of the week. We stayed in an inside facing room. Not a great view of the inside of the building, but it was blissfully quiet, which was the important thing. The hotel looks like it was built in the late 60's, early 70's, so is not pretty from the outside, however the inside is really nice and has been tastefully refurbished.  Great location, lovely room, great staff in all areas of the hotel. Lovely bar area, where my staff and guests met us for a drink before we headed off for the evening.   Breakfast was included. Fully English buffet, with plenty of choice. Good as any other hotel we have been to. Restaurant is situated alongside the harbour side, so has nice views, and is very nice.  No charge for parking in the adjacent NCP car park when we stayed.  I would choose this hotel any time for a stay in Bristol. Good value at £98.00 for the Saturday night. I highly recommend this hotel. 
4;" My wife and I stayed for one night in February 2015; we stayed in the fantastic 'Miss Potter Suite'.  The Hotel is gorgeous. The Miss Potter Suite was just fantastic - there was champagne and a bouquet of roses upon arrival which was a lovely extra touch. The hot tub was brilliant too - even if it was snowing.  The staff could not do enough for you; they were brilliant. The best we have ever experienced.  The food was brilliant; we decided to go for the Prestige Menu (a mini taster menu) which was absolutely fantastic. We didn't do the matching wines but from looking at their wine menu their selection on offer is impressive.  We can't wait to return. It is a beautiful place with the most amazing of views over Lake Windermere. "
4; We were very impressed with this hotel. First off it was only 200 meters from the station and immediately opposite a Tesco Local. A very modern stylish place with quality fixtures and fittings, the staff were classy, well trained and attentive. We used the hotel as an overnight base to visit the museums in London so didn't eat or drink at the hotel. The day we checked out we were still visiting museums so were delighted we were able to leave our luggage in a secure room for collection that evening. Overall I would say this hotel is a touch of class and quality in a great location for an excellent rate 
4; We stayed here for one night before visiting Fakenham racecourse. Excellent hotel. Rooms spacious and very clean. Used the swimming pool which was great. Luckily we checked in early enough, as the pool closed at 5:30. Didn't make use of the restaurant for dinner or breakfast, as thought it was a bit overpriced, especially when compared to the excellent value for the room. This was our first stay in a Mercure hotel and we will certainly use them again. 
4; Great hotel, very helpful staff, excellent breakfast. Rooms are clean and comfortable. will be returning very shortly. All in all excellent value for money. 
4; My wife and I were married locally at Smalley Church and picked Morley Hayes as our reception venue and stayed at Morley Hayes Hotel (Penthouse suite) on 23rd December 2012.  Morley Hayes Wedding Reception Comments:- I can not think of any words that can possibly describe highly enough our Morley Hayes experience. Whilst appearing calm, friendly and professional, every single member of staff `worked their socks off` to ensure every single person in attendance was happy. The attention to detail was incredible. After tearing my suit getting out of the wedding car upon arrival, the Morley Hayes Events supervisor (Annabel) and her team immediately arranged a super repair job without being prompted. To our relief, Annabel also helped my clueless ushers and me(!) to attach our buttonhole flowers to our suits! The room decoration instructions we provided were very complex but we left them with the Morley Hayes events team to follow - the room was set up exactly as per the instructions given and we were thrilled with the results! The Managing director of Morley Hayes brought out some hand warmers for my bride whilst we were outside having photo's taken. The wedding breakfast was absolutely beautiful and special dietry and seating requirements were also taken care of with no problems at all. Completely fantastic experience.  Morley Hayes Hotel Comments:- After the superb wedding reception we then landed in our super luxurious and conveniently located hotel. From the second you walk towards the hotel you can tell that you are going to have an amazing stay. It is simply stunning. The service is simply top-drawer and the room we stayed in (the Penthouse Suite) was incredible. We had never stayed in a room as inviting, cozy and luxurious. Everything appeared to be brand new, immaculately clean and tidy. The shower was quite simply the best shower I have ever used, the television built into the bath wall tiles was a brilliant novelty and added a touch of class and the bed was incredibly comfortable. I could go on to mention how fantastic the golf course view was from the large balcony and tell you about all the food and drinks available around the room but you'd be reading for a few more hours so I'll leave it there and just say this...  Morley Hayes and Morley Hayes Hotel is absolutely stunning and should be everyones first choice for any occasion. Thank you all at Morley Hayes! 
4; My wife and I stayed for a three night long weekend .as with the other two hotels in this group we have stayed at we found everything excellent . Particularly the staff who all seem to be enjoying being at work .Food was excellent.Overall a very good and relaxing weekend .we will be returning 
4; Just come back from a night at 30 Janes Street and have to say the whole trip was great. The rooms all uniquely decorated with relaxing jacuzzi bath, which we didn't want to get out of! We ate in the restaurant and the food was gorgeous and Shariff, our waiter, was outstanding. A credit to the company. Will go back to the hotel again for sure! 
4; We stayed at Number Four for our Wedding Anniversary and found it to be perfect. Staff were friendly and attentive. The room was clean and well appointed - it looked brand new. The lounge was plush and the dining area immaculate. Breakfast was hearty and the evening meal we had in Cutlers restaurant memorable. Number Four at Stow is a hotel I'd recommend and would love to visit again. 
4; We stayed here on the evening after going into the park during the day. Our son is dairy intolerant and I can honestly say this is one of the top restaurants that we have ever been to that cater for needs. Their attitude was positive and very forthcoming. Kate dealt with us during evening meal and the next morning at breakfast. The manager communicates to the head chef and everything is cooked separately, nothing was left to chance. Thank you for making this part of our stay a whole lot easier. We would stay here again when visiting the park. 
4; We stayed here for it was close to every place we wanted to visit,we were not disappointed..Warm welcome from staff ,check in quick and shown to lovely room excellent bed,bathroom etc.Bar nicely decorated,good sleep not sure where people found noise from.First class breakfast catering for all tastes.Would recommend to all and will use again 
4; We have been going to Rye on a regular basis but have not stayed at the George, instead going for the smaller boutique hotels such as Hayden's. We booked a few days before hand for a Sunday night stay. The weather was bad so our plans for the Sunday afternoon were curtailed and as such we called the hotel to see if they could let us have our room early. Really helpful staff and by 1pm we were shown our room which was a good size, lovely bed, clean and really well furnished with a large bay window that had a steel bath.  We had dinner that night at the Grill, which was excellent - Oysters with Spanish Sausage for starters and Chateaubriand for main. Breakfast the next morning was also very good with fresh kippers - always feel guilty about eating them because of the smell but never guilty enough not to have them.  Really impressed with the hotel, room, price, food, all of which were all of a high standard and would go back 
4; This hotel is set in lovely grounds on the outskirts of Bristol. Plenty of parking and a warm welcome received. Our room was spacious with ample hanging space, but no chest of drawers. The breakfast was reasonable, however, not as much on offer as other Hilton hotels I have stayed at. The spa, pool and gym area is a great asset to this hotel and the facilities are first class. It was disappointing however that the pool was taken over on Monday morning by an aerobics class with a Sargent major in charge!! Only one lane was available for guests with the rest of the pool taken up by the class. This is most unsuitable for guests with young children and the times of classes were not advertised to guests.  We received friendly service by all staff during our stay and recommend the hotel for good location, cleanliness and service 
4; This is the second time I have stayed in a De Vere Hotel, Previously I stayed at Carden Park which was also fantastic, which is partly why I chose to stay at Oulton Hall when I needed an hotel in this area, I found the staff to be helpful and profesional, the layout, building and decor to be second to none, and the food was fantastic! I booked the hotel as a little treat for my girlfriend and she was equally as pleased. I will certainly be staying here again! 
4;Good hotel, great buffet breakfast in the morning. Easy walking distance to the near by shopping and conference centres.  I asked for a taxi to be ordered for me in the moment and the reception staff were very useful.
4; Superb 5 minute walk to centre, nice and clean apartment, everything you need, would stay again. Staff very helpful breakfast basic, own car park but it's £10 a day, all in all worth it, tip upgrade to the penthouse for a tenner 
4; I confess we had a two for one offer here but at £19.95 for a 3 course Sunday lunch, flawlessly served with good sized portions this was pretty damn fine.  There is a limited menu with 6 to 8 options for starter, mains and desert which no doubt helps with the efficiency of service. The roast beef was probably as perfect as any I have ever eaten, thickly sliced, tender and truly delicious.  Our party of 8 were introduced to our waitress who looked after us well and ensured the timing of each course was to our exact liking. The Carrington Grill restaurant itself is classy and comfortable and the wine list is extensive and excellent.   We unanimously gave it a big thumbs up and will come here again.   If you are going to use this restaurant arrive a little early and enjoy a seat in the garden room adjacent to the bar. Equally classy, good views and sooo relaxing. 
4; Excellent location with free parking. Beautiful room. Even supplied a free tablet computer! The bar was excellent with a very friendly barmaid who took a pride in preparing her own cocktails! Lovely breakfast. We would definitely recommend this hotel. 
4; A haven of calm in the busy town of Kingston . After years of staying in disappointing hotels in this area visiting our daughters at University , we were delighted to have found this gem . It has a wonderful country house atmosphere and we could happily have just spent all our time there . The staff are delightful . We shall definitely return to this very interesting house . 
4; Came here for accommodation as we were at nearby Pimhill Barn for a wedding. It's a mix of really old and quaint along with modern accommodation. The room we had was clean tidy and had a really nice powerful shower. We were blown away by the genuine friendliness of the staff and there willingness to talk to you. Nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was really tasty and very good quality, in a super setting. We also had great Nespresso Lattes. We loved the General Manager Malcom who was an absolute delight. Noor who looked after us at breakfast was so helpful and nice. Rebecca on reception was delightful too. They made a good stay a great stay! Hope to visit again soon. 
4; We stayed for a weekend in the Grand. It is a lovely hotel with spacious rooms and large bathroom - the bed could have been bigger as was rather snug. Breakfast was help yourself and was very good. The location is brilliant for seeing the sights of Bristol and the front desk gave us a very helpful map.  I would recommend this hotel. 
4; This hotel was lovely. My sister in law and I had a one night stay (28th June) and had a double room each (401 and 415). Very comfortable bed, very clean room, mini bar stocked with soft drinks all complimentary, toiletries in the bathroom, lovely shower. The room had everything you needed including iron and ironing board, wifi, tv (pay to view), ipod dock, tea tray, up to date magazines. The staff were exceptionally friendly, Salvatore a delight to chat to. We had an evening meal in the restaurant which was very good and breakfast - well soooooo much choice! We will be staying here again. 
4; Booked the Premier Inn in Bournemouth for £35 a night and we were given an eighth floor room which had fantastic views overlooking Bournemouth and the beach. The room was a bit bare and could do with a refurb but it was such spectacular value and the staff were very friendly that we would definitely stay there again 
4; Recently visited Beamish for a family wedding and have to say it lived up to the high expectations we all had . The room was fine on all counts as was the food the service and the facilities . so all in all it made for a excellent wedding venue and place to stay. My only complaint would be the quality of the lager (fosters) which was very flat and had poor taste which hopefully was a one off as I have been before and that was not a issue 
4; Clean and well presented hotel at a reasonable price. Helpful and efficient staff. Good facilities in a very central location, ideal for my business needs. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. 
4; 2 day visit over bank holiday for romantic break. Was a late booking so room was poor really but not worried as probably last one. Room was noisy and dirty but comfortable. Facilities a absolutely fantastic, service very attentive (restaurant possibly best I've experienced) food delicious and varied and all this makes up for poor room. All in all 5 star hotel and good price. Spa very good and grounds a pleasure to walk. Only 50 minutes away so will definitely return!! 
4;" We stayed at this hotel Saturday 19th July, as a party of four, to celebrate my wife's birthday.  The hotel is extremely pleasant and occupies a perfect location in the center of Helmsley. My wife and I have stayed at many similar hotels in Yorkshire and without doubt The Black Swan has been the very best of them all, it is the level of service that makes the difference although it is by no means lacking in comfort or quality of food and drink. On price we found it to be extremely competitive when compared to similar establishments.  My wife was charmed to receive a small birthday gift in the room upon arrival, even more so when our waiter presented her with a beautiful desert plate containing patisserie lollipops and 'Happy Birthday' piped upon it. Much more sophisticated than a bunch of singing waiters with a firework in a cheap cake. Best of all I don't even recall informing the hotel that we were celebrating a birthday. On a personal note I was very pleased to find that the evenings entertainment in the bar, a signer/guitarist, extended until late (although not at a volume that would disturb sleeping guests) and we could enjoy a good hour after dinner.  I have to mention two staff members who made our stay extra special; Vaughan and Grant, the former for his charm and enthusiasm and the latter a fellow Geordie who made us laugh a lot whilst going about his work ever so professionally.  We can't wait to go back. "
4; Excellent facilities and close to all amenities. Would advise not booking twin beds if you are on the 'large' side. They are extremely narrow and there is a fear of falling out. Breakfast was one of the best experiences of any hotel we have visited. 
4; Great service , all the staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Fantatsic location overlooking a fabulous stretch of coastline. Food also very good. Would definitely recommend hotel to friends, family and other business colleagues looking to do the same style golf trip.  
4; i always stay in a Melia hotel if possible but this new venture by Melia is fantastic, service ,rooms food all the best and a a price you can afford without breaking the bank, already booked my next break here,and I look forward to them opening in other city's 
4; I stayed there with my girlfriend just for 2 nights and it was the perfect getaway. The staff are very friendly and the room was lovely. Not too large but big enough, well designed and a really comfy bed. We then ate at the bar in the evening and it was honestly the best meal of my life. The portions were big and absolutely amazing! Couldn't reccommend this place enough! 
4; This review was written 6 hours after getting home from a 2 night stay at The Rising Sun - I wanted to review it while still fresh in my mind.   When we booked this hotel for our weekend break I admit that I wasn't too sure what to expect because of one or two negative reviews on Tripadvisor. I needn't have worried! We arrived late on Friday night after getting lost and finding road closures extended our travel time. We were very aware that last orders in the restaurant was at 9.30pm and after arriving with only 5 minutes to spare, the receptionist told us not to rush as the chef would stay on to look after us. After checking in we were escorted to the accommodation and shown to  The Ladybower Suite. A HUGE room with a HUGE bathroom. Well furnished and very comfortable. It overlooks the main road and previous reviews have mentioned road noise but i am being completely honest when I say that it did not bother us one bit (and my wife is a very light sleeper) The Ladybower Suite is easily the largest hotel room we've ever stayed in in the UK.  The food and service at The Rising Sun really is very good. It's warm, welcoming and friendly without being obtrusive. We ate in the restaurant on both evenings and our dog was able to lie under our table while we ate (Yes! It's also a dog friendly hotel). Sarah, the proprietors daughter, was excellent - she gave great service and lots of 'touristy information'.   My wife and I enjoyed a great weekend at The Rising Sun and we will definitely be returning to stay again - don't be put off by any adverse reviews which you read! It's almost as though they have been written by a disgruntled ex member of staff!!!!! 
4; We booked a 2 night stay here to celebrate my 50th birthday. We upgraded to a suite on the basis that they would include complimentary car parking. Having a suite gives access to the Executive Lounge which gives you free soft drinks, beers and wine along with pizza slices and other nibbles. This is well worth the upgrade when you also include the car parking and breakfast being included.  The hotel itself is very clean and modern. The skylounge is well worth the trip to the 12th floor and the view is amazing. The rooms are clean and warm and we had 2 iMac's in the room which act as TV's too.  My only small complaint was there needs to be more staff in the restaurant as we had to queue to be seated yet there were lots of free tables that simply needed clearing. If they address this then this really is a perfect hotel in a perfect location for easy access to the sights.  (if you do stay here be sure to go for a meal up the Shard - WELL worth the view) 
4;Stayed at the Richmond Hill for one night on a Travel Zoo deal in one of the newly refurbished Richmond Hill King size rooms. The reception staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful and spent time giving us some directions and asmall map of Richmond. The room was spacious and comfortable, even if it did take some time to work out where the wardrobe was! Had an inclusive 3 course meal of the Garden menu which was very good, albeit the eine was a touch on the expensive side. Great location within 10 minute walk of Richmond
4; Stayed here on Christmas Eve 2010 and then again on the 30th Dec on my way back home.Got an amazing deal £80 per room dinner, bed and breakfast both night's.Food was very good staff were very friendly rooms were very clean.Bargain. 
4;We stayed here for 1 night b4 flying out on Holiday. We left our car for 2 weeks. The hotel was easy to find, comfortable, clean, good choice of food and drinks from the bar / restaurant and shuttle bus service was excellent.
4; We stayed in The Chestnut Suite for our first night having got married on 26th October. What a fabulous big room/suite with TV in bath, fantastic jacuzzi shower. Huge room with large four poster bed and all items you could ever need including a record player even with fave LP Abbey Road by Beatles on the deck ! Lovely full English breakfast. Then a walk round the fantastic grounds, Japanese garden, waterfalls etc etc. Great views and fir trees abound. Manicured lawns where we sat on old fashioned deck chairs in the garden in the beautiful October sunshine. Just brilliant. Well done all concerned and a special mention to Natalie in Reservations. Well done young lady !!! 
4;I stayed at the Chudleigh on and off for 3 months while on a work placement in Clacton, and it was always a fantastic place to stay. Carol and Peter are such lovely people - we had some great chats and they always treated me like family. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and quiet with all the amenities you could require (plus a nice complementary selection of tea, coffee, biscuits and even some chocolate!). I slept very well every night that I stayed there, and then breakfast in the morning was always very tasty and enough to keep me going through a long morning at work! I would recommend the Chudleigh to anyone, and am looking forward to staying there again myself when I return to Clacton.
4; Lovely hotel with great staff & service Our room was a good size & very quiet - important in London on a Friday night  The hotel is in a great position with Covent Gdn, West End etc in walking distance 
4; We've now been visiting Soar Mill Cove Hotel for the past decade, and always leave feeling refreshed, inspired and well fed. The owners clearly love the place, and redecorate every few years, so the rooms always look fresh and clean. The food is fantastic too! 
4; Excellent, great hotel, nice place, nice people...well done Liverpool 
4; We recently stayed at the Willam Cecil hotel and had the most amazing service. We were taking our son and his partner as an engagement present and they upgraded them to a beautiful honeymoon suite with private garden. We had a fantastic meal in the restaurant and the best hotel breakfast we have ever had. The room was spotless with lovely comfy beds, and everything was done to make our stay as good as possible. All the staff were charming and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anybody. Excellent. 
4; I stayed here on a personal recommendation and had high expectations. I must say I was not let down on any of these. The hotel is immaculately kept with many original features inside. We had a room at the top of the hotel which was of a good size and very warm despite being cold enough for a frost outside. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel. The breakfast in the morning was of a high standard with plenty of choice. Overall highly recommended and I will definitely be visiting again. 
4; Just stayed for our anniversary. Simply sublime. Very relaxed, peaceful location, great room and gardens and brilliant meal. I would thoroughly recommend it. Only slight negative is the use of foie gras in a couple of the dishes. 
4; We do not usually go to the same resort more than once or twice, but we have never enjoyed any hotel as much as the Imperial. Everything is done to the highest standards, but most important is the friendly helpful attitude of all the staff, and the pleasant atmosphere is felt from the moment one enters the door. 
4; We had the most brilliant stay at this hotel, our room was spacious and comfortable, the food was excellent and, oh what a treat, to be served freshly cooked breakfast rather than the usual hit and miss scrum of a buffet. The staff were friendly and very polite. The location is perfect, easy access to both Poole and Bournemouth. Can't wait for our next visit, we could have stayed forever! 
4; Nice welcome, easy check in, good breakfast, bar price pretty good for London pleasant staff, room was clean and tidy would have liked some drawers but no big deal the Travel Lodge is a great for the theatres we will definitely stay there again and would recommend it 
4;We found this hotel after booking via Holiday Extras at the Mecure Gatwick, unfortunately Holiday Extras failed to inform us that the Mecure had changed to a Travel Lodge, that it was undergoing renovation and that they had cancelled all their bookings and moved them to the Arora in Crawley. Thankfully Arora had our booking and once we had found our way there (no thanks to the useless directions provided by Travel Lodge and largely thanks to the sat nav!) we found the hotel much nicer (in fact the receptionist at the Travel Lodge told us that the Arora was a far nicer hotel and we would be much happier there, great advert for Travel Lodge!) The Arora were very helpful and I was able to leave the car securely for our weeks holiday, the transfers were fine although we did have to use a taxi as our flight was so early it was before the Arora start their own shuttle service, however the trip was quick and efficient. Our return transfer was fine as it was in the afternoon. The family room we had was large and comfortable and we had an excellent dinner in the hotel restaurant. We would definitely use this hotel again even though its slightly further out than the other Gatwick hotels it’s still only 10-15mins away.
4;" This hotel was booked for me; very close to the railway station. I was worried it might be noisy with the bus station and taxi ranks nearby but there was no disturbance and my room was at the front of the premises. The room was very spacious and well furnished; it was clean and fresh. Breakfast was excellent and the restaurant was so pleasant I ate in the hotel rather than trying to find something outside. The meals I had were excellent. Staff were welcoming, attentive and helpful. A really pleasant place to stay. "
4; Was there 2 for nights with large group of mixed ages. Was also quite involved in some of the last minute detail and planning for the event. The 'Sales' person in charge was amazing, unflappable and very accommodating for all requirements. On arrival was greeted with a smile and efficiency and this followed through the whole weekend from every member of staff from the Banqueting to the Bar, Breakfast and Night Porter. 62 Very happy customers who ALL had a very enjoyable weekend and not a bad word to say - an amazing outcome. Thank you to ALL the staff 
4; Loved the hotel.We stay last weekend for our daughter's13th birthday,the staff were marvelous,Breakfast excellent so much choice . Very central and good transport links .Room very clean ,staff came to our room on the day of our daughters birthday and presented her with a lovely cake and a card signed by all the staff . would recommend to family and friends ,will go back again . Thanks to everyone who made our stay memorble  From the Chaplin family Nottingham 
4; Lovely hote lovely grounds wood definitely recommend. Certain rooms are supposed to be haunted they are in the original part of the hotel and to be honest we went to see the rooms and you did get a sence of unease. 
4;"I've been a regular visitor to Monkey Island for a long time, not more than once or twice a year, you understand, but over many, many years. I've never stayed, as I'm quite local, but have often used the bar, snacks and afternoon tea service. I'm was quite surprised by the number of negative reviews, but also understand a visit can be made or broken by staff attitude. And THAT, of course can vary tremendously from day to day and from establishment to establishment. Personally, I have mostly experienced very good service, but on a couple of times it HAS been a bit indifferent if I'm honest, and really that should never, ever happen in a obviously high class establishment such as this.  I've never reviewed it, so I have already decided I would after today's visit. Of course, I didn't let the staff know that before hand!  We arrived around 3.15pm without a booking for afternoon tea. A party of four, myself and my partner, her mother and my 95 year old nan, possibly one of the most kindest and selfless people who exist on the planet. It was a very quiet Monday afternoon. We were greeted by Andrew who was chatty, friendly and helpful. After discovering that the afternoon tea menu had changed (there used to be some cheaper options, now fixed at £18 a head, which is certainly not cheap) we chose one of those, and a couple of the smaller (sweet only) £9 options, consisting of scones only, as well as an extra coffee. It turned out, this was about right quantity wise. I say 'about', because there was one change, see later!  Filippo set up the table for us and at first, I felt he was slightly aloof, but we got chatting and he warmed to us and vice versa, eventually learning all sorts of interesting things about his life in Sicily! He was also extraordinarily helpful, making the long walk from the main building to the Pagoda where we had decided to sit, regularly to check we were ok or wanted anything else without hint of complaint or inconvenience.  The tea was a mix of good and spectacular. The finger sandwiches were a little on the stingy side for an £18 tea, but very nice, the tarts were lovely and the scones, whilst nothing special in themselves, were supplied with simply fantastic clotted cream, lemon curd and jam. I suspect very strongly the last two were made in house, or at least came from very high quality suppliers. Simply excellent, and they made the tea what its was. We joked about how we could sneak off with the remaining jam and curd and I think we were only half joking!  But I must tell you one extra thing: after consuming all there was, a solitary scone remained. We suspected my nan wanted it, but being far too polite to take it she insisted she didn't want it and it was unceremoniously consumed by the author and others. Only a few minutes later, she said &quot;I would have liked another one, had there been one left!&quot; in the way that only 95 year old nannies can do!  Cheekily, I nipped back into the main building, told Andrew the story with a smile and asked him directly if we could have one more scone. Without hesitation and with an understanding smile he said &quot;of course, Sir, I'll bring it to you&quot;. True to his word, a few minutes later Filippo walked towards us complete with extra scone served and presented properly as if it had been for the queen.  Now, of course, the owners may frown on this for their staff giving away 'free' food and there's an argument here for that (you can't have everyone doing it can you!!?), but also owning a cafe style establishment myself, sometimes these things are entirely appropriate. In this case, the cost of goods SO small and the impact SO significant, it leads to an entirely positive experience. Put it this way, it was a small gesture that made an already lovely experience into an even better one and we made sure that both Andrew and Filippo understood we were grateful. It was the right call, well done.  Thanks Monkey Island Hotel, I understand all to well it's difficult with staffing sometimes, but these made the effort and the day. Recommended"
4;Decided to stay here before holiday to Spain. Used their stay, park and fly package. Checking in myslef and the car was very easy. Room very comfortable and well appointed. Had a snack in the bar which was good quality, well served by friendly staff.  The hotel has direct access to North Terminal which makes life very easy.  On my return the car had been moved to a very short walk from front of hotel so i could bring car to hotel door where my luggage was loaded for me.  Highly recommnded and I will use again.
4; We had afternoon tean at this hotel on Tuesday. The food and staff were excellent and we are now considering having our Christmas Party here. On of the ladies has already booked her son's party here later in the year. 
4; I stayed here last weekend for a leisure break. I had a lovely time. The hotel is full of character and the staff are lovely. The room was well appointed, spacious and clean. The food was excellent and a great choice. Breakfast was ample and loads of choice. I'm looking forward to coming back again,. 
4; I stayed at the hotel for one night before a flight to Bahrain. The hotel is close to the airport but the Heathrow Hotel Hoppa shuttle bus (supplied by National Express, not the hotel) was a bit slow and very busy in the morning. I would suggest pay the extra and get a taxi.  Hotel staff were very friendly and I found the restaurant to be excellent. The rooms were some of the best I have stayed in, clean and well equipped.    For holiday or business this hotel is a good choice. 
4; An excellent hotel set in beautiful surroundings , obviously attractive to golfers because of the 18 hole course, but plenty of attractions for other guests. The dining room is pleasant and well attented, food is both A la carte and buffet so choice plentiful and tasty. The room we had was very substantial, perhaps in need a bit of a face lift but still very grand with a very comfortable bed. Breakfast is a must, excellent service and a great selection to choose from. Also the pool, jacquzi and sauna are worth indulging in especially to clear your head in the morning. Taking a walk around the grounds is a relaxing way to work off your meal , even just to admire the architecture and the grounds it is set in. This hotel is certainly in my top ten in regard to courteous staff and impressive grandeur. We left feeling relaxed and invigorated and ready for an explore of historic Norwich, a most charming city with a most appealing Catherdral. 
4; We stayed on a two night 'Chatsworth House' break which proved to be very enjoyable and good value. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. It is a Victorian Railway hotel and retains a great deal of its charm which some people may find a bit staid.  The food was very good, well presented and served in a friendly efficient manner. We would have eaten there for the second night of our break but the restaurant was virtually empty and lacked atmosphere. Like quite a few others, we had a meal in the bar on our second night. The room was very good, nicely furnished with a very clean, modern bathroom. Although close to a main road, we did not find the road noise too intrusive. The hotel is well placed for the city centre and for routes in and out of the city making it a good base for visiting the area.  Having a fast reliable free internet connection was a bonus.  Overall a very enjoyable stay, the excellent staff being the outstanding feature. 
4; We had a great day at a lovely location, the hotel & staff couldn't have been more helpful. The course was in excellent condition( my golf wasn't so good though), the clubhouse meals were great value for money compared to the main hotel.. will definitely go back. 
4; Great location. Service excellent from the moment we arrived. Staff excellent and felt totally pampered. Location superb and nothing too much trouble from all the Staff. Feature rooms so so lovely. If you are looking for the best Hotel in Bath - save any more of your time and book the Francis Hotel. 
4; Just wanted to write a quick review about our wedding on the 17th April 2011  The whole experience from the initial enquiry through to checking out the day after the wedding was first class.  Our first contact at the hotel was Nicola who was the wedding coordinator. Nicola took care of absolutely everything and made us feel as though nothing was too much trouble. Her communication was first class and she guided us through the whole process with such care and professionalism.  We visited the hotel several weeks before the wedding for a food tasting session and all I can say is WOW. The food was out of this world and the service from the wonderful staff matched the food. We arrived the day before the wedding and were greeted by the receptionist and Nicola who took control from that point. We didn't have to do or worry about anything Nicola and her staff took care of it all.  The three rooms which were exclusively ours on the day were all beautifully presented. We were assigned a Master of Ceremonies who was around all day to help in any way possible. He was so professional, helpful and made us just relax. Many of our guests commented that ours was the most relaxing wedding they had ever been to which is exactly what we wanted. The food, rooms, service and whole experience was wonderful from start to finish and we weren't disapointed about any aspect of the wedding. We should also mention the registrars from Malton who were wonderful and like everyone else made us very relaxed. A huge thank you to everyone at the Black Swan for a brilliant day for us and all our guests. 
4; The staff were friendly, helpful and polite. The view from our room was wonderful and the room was lovely. Clean sheets and towels daily, replenished tea, coffee, milk and biscuits daily without question. The location was fabulous, a couple of minutes walk and you are on Regent Street and it only took us 20 minutes slow wander to get to Leicester Square. We are coming back to London next year and I would not have any hesitation staying here again. Thank you for a lovely stay. 
4; Stayed her before but this was the first time we went business class, it was not much more and included 15 days parking, you leave the car in the hotel carpark and they bring back when you land.  The room was very comfortable and what you would expect from a top class brand. What made it even more special was the business lounge with complimentary drinks and food. The views are over the runways and we enjoyed having breakfast in the same room rather than going downstairs to the main restaurants. 
4;Only stayed for one night with young grandchildren and would return again by ourselves to this interesting hotel with pleasant and friendly staff. Nice room and good breakfast. Only downside was a rather noisy courtyard until 11.30 pm but only to be expected. Very handy for town centre and river.
4;100 of us spent 5 nites from sunday to Friday at Elcot. We were looked after very well by all staff who were very efficient and down to earth. KAT, peter and Marco dif an excellent job. Food was very good throuout and frooms were clean and comfortable. Very succesful and enjoyable.
4;" We've just returned from a wonderful stay at the Manor House Hotel, having stayed in the secluded Apple cottage with hot tub, a fabulous 8 course tasting menu, cream tea with fresh hot scones, breakfast, pre dinner drinks and canapés and a lovely Molton Brown gift set, all of which was included as part of the &quot;Suite Dreams&quot; package. The cottage was wonderful and incredibly luxurious with a real 5 star feel, the dinner was lovely and service all round was excellent and we were made to feel very welcome and special. For everything included in the package, I must say that I believe it to be very good value. The only slight downside was the hot water ran out when trying get to have showers, but the staff rectified the problem so fast it was not an issue at all. We would love to come and stay again soon and can't recommend the package we chose highly enough. "
4; Stayed here for my friends wedding, I don't think I can put into words just how incredible the staff & everyone was here. They made everything perfect.   I'd recommended this hotel to everyone. Food was exceptional, the room for my stay was first class. 
4; We've stayed in a number of the Malmaison hotels and have always thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This time we got an excellent deal - £89 for 2 nights. The hotel is in a great central location, the bed was very comfy and we were able to check in at 11.30am. Cocktails in the bar were costly but worth it. Will definitely stay again and highly recommend this chain. 
4;Myself and a friend came for a massage at the Spa within Malmaison and we were not disappointed. The surroundings are luxurious with dim lighting, comfy lounging and lovely scented air! The staff were all friendly and the treatment itself was well worth the money. Lovely plinky plonky music playing throughout with free drinks. Would go back again for a massage.
4; My wife and I stayed at this hotel for the first time in 2012, we loved it so much that we chose it for our wedding venue the following year. Since the wedding we have been back there a couple more times, the most recent being last weekend. I cannot fault the place. It’s full of character, the staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are great. Well equipped, clean and tastefully decorated to a high standard. The breakfast is probably the best buffet breakfast I’ve had in any hotel. It is also conveniently located close to Bray and The Waterside Inn, my favourite restaurant of all time and the purpose for our visit on this occasion. I highly recommend this excellent hotel. We will be back time and again. 
4; My fiancee and I stayed at the hotel n the Fizzy Fridays deal. I have to say from the drive up to the hotel it was beautiful, the service on entrance was made to feel more than welcome. I was given the option of 2 rooms and took room 3 as it was just lovely and with a beautiful view over the gardens. The evening 3 course meal was to say the least by far the finest and most delicious dinner my partner and I had the pleasure of eating in a long time. As a chef in my former trade I can assure anyone they will not be disappointed. The lounge in the evening next to the log fir with our drinks was lovely. the hotel is just a marvel and very interesting to view all the character this property actually has. The breakfast, well ....we were not surprised at all, this was delicious also. I have to say all in all the service, food and stay as well as the ambiance left my fiancee and I talking about this since. We will definitely be seeing you again  Thank you to all those tht made our stay so so lovely. challenge anyone to find fault in this hotel.   Jon & Caroline 
4;" My wife and I spent just one night here last week and had a very relaxing time. The service was discreet, friendly and efficient and the atmosphere was laid back.  The rooms are well designed; flexible, functional and fun!  Overall you feel you are treated as an individual not just a guest!  Martin and Lesley "
4; This was a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is beautifully designed - the public areas are open, light, and nicely decorated in a fresh, modern style. The room offered everything we needed, and we found the bed extremely comfortable and slept very well.  The pool and the fitness facilities looked very attractive, although we didn't use them on this occasion. The breakfast buffet is varied, with something to appeal to most tastes. The staff made us feel very welcome, and we will definitely use this hotel the next time we find ourselves in the area. 
4; this was a recent Travel Zoo offer and from entering the hotel to checking out it was difficult to find fault with this hotel. Staff were friendly, welcoming and efficient and the quality of the food at dinner and breakfast was first class. A big plus was the gym and pool which were the best we have encountered in similar hotels. We will certainly be revisiting this hotel and have enquired about their New Year events. 
4; We have stayed here lots of times now. It is ideal for shows etc and saves us getting a late trin back up north. Easy cab or train to most places in London. we have particlarly used it for Sadlers Wells and the West End theatres  It can be very cheap if you book really early. But always good value.  Lovely modern well equipped rooms. We love the special features like real milk and water provided. Comfortable fittings, esp the bed and immaculate shower etc. the light and healthy breakfast supplied is fine, although we usually go for a cooked breakfast as well.  Restaurant is excellent for a full breakfast and through the day.  We particularly like the people - always friendly and happy to help.  Good to know - there is a very handy little general store just across the road from the front door. 
4; The hotel is clean, rooms spacious and well presented. Staff all very pleasant. The evening meal was perfectly acceptable and breakfast too. Although I do have to say the coffee was undrinkable so best opt fot tea. There is no doubt that a this is a perfectly good hotel with decent food and well placed for shopping and exploring the peak district. And at £89 for a room with 3 course evening meal, breakfast plus 2 tickets to Chatsworth House excellent value for money. 
4; Don't believe the negative reviews for Pendley Manor! We were slightly concerned about comments by previous reviewers but needn't have worried. As always, take an overall view of what others say. The hotel is excellent. Great friendly welcome on arrival, clean and a beautiful old manor house. Room and facilities superb with plenty of room and a comfy clean bed. Swimming pool warm and refreshing and the grounds lovely to walk in. Evening dinner in the restaurant was a bit disappointing - overall good, but relatively over priced for the standard of food served, and the wine pricey. Breakfast plentiful. All the staff in all areas great and we would happily stay here again. Thank you. 
4; I have just returned home with a full belly and a massive smile on my face,because l have just had the most delicious lunch at Lower SLaughter Manor. I have taken advantage of there lunchtime special deal a few times last year and enjoyed the whole experiance but I have to say todays lunch was fab. Frederick matched the supurb cooking with a couple of the most delicious wines and I have to say Chef you are on fire! Truley great food. I CANT WAIT TO GO BACK! LOVE IT! Adam 
4; I recently stayed for an overnight package with my wife to celebrate her birthday. All staff were extremely good witht their jobs and the place itself is brilliant. As for the evening meal - this far surpassed our expectations and full marks must go to the head chep for this. Would definately reccommend and Im already planning my next stay. 
4; I have stayed in many Hiltons due to work and I must admit this has to be my favourite, hence the reason I am writing about it. The service was excellent, staff are exceptionally friendly and endeavour to solve an issues which may arise, the food is very good and the list goes on. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Kensington/Chelsea area. 
4; What a find! The moment our large party arrived, we were greeted with some of the best cake I have ever had (and as those who know me will testify, I have eaten a lot of cake in my time). That was bettered only by the welcome from Beccy and Derek and it felt instantly as if we were staying with friends. They both worked tirelessly all weekend to make it the great break it was (as well as the waiter with the stickered mini and amusingly-named friends). The location is out of this world, the rooms lovely with extremely comfortable beds and the gardens expertly manicured by Derek. The large lounge with a great roaring fire (even welcome on a warm weekend!) was very relaxing. They kindly catered not just for all for the adults (13 of us) with cracking full English breakfasts and incredibly accomlished evening meals but also for our kids late afternoon. Incredible service, incredible place and incredible value (particularly given that it was a bank holiday weekend)!! We've already started planning a return visit! 
4; We attended a function as guests of some friends for a evening meal at the restaurant at the Casa hotel we arrived at 8 am had a few drinks all fine there and sat down for the meal starters arrived onetime really nice the main meal arrived and was perfect all excellent we all had different meals and all where nice sorbet ice cream was lovely,and desert followed all spot on will definitely go again and maybe stay the night the hotel looked really nice well staffed and friendly 
4;" Spent four days at the Langham Hotel as a member of a bowls club tour from 16th to 19th September inclusive.. The hotel was faultless. Our room had every facility, was clean and the beds out of this world. Dining room was attractive and presentable; the food came up to and beyond expectations. In fact,of 40 persons in our group, I heard not one complaint but many praised the Langham. As one would hope and expect, the staff were helpful, made one feel welcome and were most professional. I will make this hotel the first port of call when I next visit Eastbourne. Problem might be, that if you all go will there be room for me next time? "
4; We stayed here on a short break away and can safely say we loved it! We felt very relaxed from the moment we walked in.   The room itself was clean and good size with all the usual amenities you would expect to find, but with the added bonus of a walk in shower and probably the best cookies i've ever tasted! We didn’t get to use any of the spa facilities until the second day, and I for one was very impressed with selection of equipment on offer (other hotels I’ve stayed at use horrible cable multigyms!). The pool is a nice size and how could anyone resist a dip in the Jacuzzi or 10 minutes in a relaxing steam room? We certainly couldn’t.   Overall, we were very impressed with this hotel, there’s plenty to do on site or the city centre in only a short jolt away. 
4; This was a wonderful overnight stay starting with a massage in the spa bliss, rooms very comfortable and quiet and all the staff lovely and friendly!  Breakfast in the conservatory excellent and a wide choice of dishes      
4; Myself and my wife stayed at the du vin for 1 on the 24th November. We came to Newcastle as our first full night away together following the birth of our first born. During the day we were shopping in the nearby Metro centre which is an amazing shopping experience. After our shopping trip we checked in and from the second we checked in the staff were all very helpful and friendly.  We relaxed for a few hours in the room which can only be described as luxury. We then headed into Newcastle town centre which is only 5mins away in a taxi for a meal and drinks. Overall our stay in the Hotek Du Vin was amazing and we will definitely be back. 
4;" Stayed for two nights as friends were getting married in the hotel. (Great ceremony!) Staff were attentive, knowledgable and really helpful. Beautiful location with loads of top pubs and eateries in walking distance. The inclusive Spa had all the usual - running machines, exercise bikes, weights room, a good sized pool, hydrotherapy pool with steam room and sauna.  A memorable stay in a lovely hotel in a special location.  Recommended.....and Nick, the &quot;Weller-esque&quot; manager was top. "
4; Excellent Meal at a very reasonable price. Staff were excellent and service very good. A great addition to the Exeter eating scene 
4; I stayed here over the recent May weekend and bank holiday, I was working in Docklands. I must say the overall experience was terrific. I ate in the bar, actually at the bar, the bar staff are top notch. Really friendly and chatty, which is nice if you're staying alone. The bar is a great focal point too, and it's easy to meet people and have exchange lively conversation :-) The rooms are very smart, the TV has many useful features and its all very modern and clean 
4; The Marylebone area is a great place to visit. It takes you away from the hustle and bustle of the city.it reminds me of a quaint English village plenty to do and if you like walking this is the area to be.. 
4; A pretty hotel set in a lovely little town. The hotel was picturesque and welcoming. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was very tidy and clean although a little more storage space (especially drawers) would be advantageous. The en suite was very well appointed and the tea making facilities very much appreciated. There was an excellent safe in the wardrobe. Only meals taken in the hotel were breakfasts and they were of excellent quality, choice and service. The leisure club has a well equipped gym, good swimming pool, sauna and steam room. There was also a Jacuzzi which whilst nice and warm did not seem to be working fully. The free WI FI had a good strong signal throughout the hotel and worked at a good speed. 
4; A two night weekend stay, as our choir were singing the weekend services at St George's Chapel. The hotel is situated on the main street, almost exactly opposite the castle.  There is a 30-place car park under the hotel (book in advance). The valet meets you at the entrance on a back street (post code supplied for sat-navs), parks the car for you and brings your things up to your room. The hotel keeps the key but there was minimal delay in gaining access to the car when required. The car park valet, like all the hotel staff, was friendly attentive and helpful but not overbearing.  I was told (by someone at the castle) that the site used to be a department store. Behind the frontage the building is mostly new. My room was a good size, comfortable large bed, smart modern decoration, bathroom modern and everything worked well, all facilities you would expect at the price, good (free) wi-fi connection, sockets where you needed them for laptop and charging phone. The lighting was a bit too sophisticated for my ageing eyes, and I had to place my bag exactly underneath a downlighter to be able to see inside properly, but I'm sure a younger person would have loved it. No noise problems, and I slept well.  The restaurant is open all day, and I had a dinner and a lunch. The food was good and I enjoyed a bottle of the local beer (Guardsman).  I had an appointment at 08.30 on the Saturday, but the kitchen does not open for breakfast until eight at the weekend. The reception staff suggested that I come down at 07.50 and start on the continental breakfast, so that I would be first in the queue when the kitchen opened at eight. My cooked breakfast arrived on the table at 07.59!  When I checked out on the Sunday morning my bags were taken down to the car to wait until I collected it in the evening. The hotel was very good, but the best thing about it was the staff. 
4; Had dinner and overnight stay with my wife and children to celebrate my recent birthday. As always the staff where very attentive and the food brilliant. Based upon the quality their 5 course taster menu is very fairly priced as is their wine selection for the meal.  Always a pleasure to eat and stay at Maids Head Hotel. 
4; Wonderful hotel and wonderful service. My sister took me here as a surprise and a pleasant surprise it was! I nearly spat feathers when I saw her hand over the £120 cash for a double room but providing the class of the room and facilities and not much difference in the price to other hotels and B&B's in the area it was worth it.  Microwave, fridge, clean glasses, kettle, towels, iron and hair drier provided and even a little docking station on top of the alarm clock for my iPhone!  Very close to shopping area, plenty of food places (we went to 'Simply Greek' and it was amaaaaazing) and of course directly across from the football grounds. Not much else needed!  Downfalls would be that the lifts seemed a little temperamental, one never turned up and we ended up opting for the stairs and we could have done with some more milk in the room. We gave up on the air con/heating as we had no idea what it was doing and how to work it...manual would be handy! They're the only negatives I have! 
4; a fabulous stay ,will not be forgotten. thoroughly recommend a stay here to anyone who loves  luxury comfort wonderful food and excellent care and attention by first class caring staff.  we will certainly be staying here again, the sooner the better. 
4; My wife and I had a lovely saturday night at this excellent spa hotel. The accommodation was charming and a cut above the average hotel room. The staff were friendly and helpful without being obseqious ( well, this is Yorkshire after all ) and we felt well looked after. Most of the staff are young and probably haven't yet learned the finer skills of communicating with customers but they were all friendly and tried very hard to be helpful. I found the gym equipment to be of top quality and the gym itself very clean and cared for. My wife enjoyed her swim too. The dinner a la carte menu consisted of dishes which were superior without being too esoteric and the portion size was robust. Similarly breakfast was plentiful and of good quality. I think the hotel deserves it's four stars. We will certainly find an excuse to go back to Thorpe Park. CB 
4; A wonderful overnight stay the suitewe stayed in was fantastic  Hotel perfectly situated for all the joys of Canterbury  Hotel staff very friendly and helpful  great meal in the Brewery Inn and breakfast was delicious Would certainly recommend this Hotel can not wait to go back  
4;" Was so fortunate that my employer has deals with this excellent hotel. Got a room, executive as well at an amazing price and couldn't be more delighted. The reception area when you check-in is stylish, modern and classy and the reception staff were lovely as well as being very efficient.  The room was amazing, two huge double beds, beautifully decorated and clean and I had to get a bus from my door to the bathroom as it was so big! The beds were uber-comfortable too and I had a great nights sleep with no noise whatsoever.  Huge windows giving great views over the canal and light and comforting too. Tea and coffee by the bucketful too with very nice biscuits.  The work area was very comfortable and usable and the Wi-Fi signal was great. Very comfortable swivel chair to sit in whilst working too. The &quot;living&quot; area was also delightful with enough seating to hold a party if you'd wanted to!.  Bathroom was spot-on, clean, tidy and accommodating. Shower above bath was nice and temperature control was perfect too. Towels were fresh and soft.  Breakfast was superb. So much to choose from and no way could anyone complain at the volume of food available, choices on offer or the manner in which it was served. The restaurant staff were lovely and very helpful and the Chef cooked my eggs in front of me so I knew how fresh they were.  And if you like black pudding then this hotel gives you a reason to stay there for that alone. Best I've ever had was all I can say.  Check-out was not a problem and concierge staff were very helpful, friendly and willing to chat.  All in all an excellent City Centre hotel in a great location, so many bars, restaurants and shopping within easy walking distance. I can't recommend it enough! "
4; Stayed here for two nights for a Business training exercise, the only two things you need to know are.  The rooms are slightly dated but very clean, very comfortable and in very good condition what youd expect if you were on a business trip or using it as a base.  Second the Food is briliant, seriously good, one of the best steaks ive ever had was here. Breakfast was also great, can be a little upperclass at times but it depends on the other hotel guests at the time but i certainly enjoyed staying in this hotel. 
4;" St Ermins is a friendly and sophisticated hotel,perfect central location for the heart of central London within easy reach of all major toursit attractions and sights.Have stayed in many hotels around the world and rate St Ermins as one of the &quot;Best&quot; experiences to date.The staff are very friendly and most helpful and the food is excellent.We are planning another visit later on in the year and we shall definately be back for more! "
4; the staff did so much to make our stay so lovely,   very kind, friendly and welcoming... and so thoughtful.  everyone from jo, franella to anita..  even radu (hotel bar man) and the security guard were nice    minor niggles: breakfast coffee isn't quite good enough, some items on breakfast buffet are under/over cooked 
4; Avoid the stress of rushing to the airport to catch a flight by staying the night before in this good quality hotel. Clean rooms, nice restaurants and bars with friendly staff.   It really adds a day to your holiday.   
4; Having stayed at Thornton Hall in the past I had a pleasant surprise, they have refurbished most bedrooms. We stayed in one of the new rooms, it was a pleasure. New modern bathrooms with plenty of space and great facilities. The toiletries are Elemis a real treat! We ate in the Italian Restaurant again a real treat, food and service were top class, I was delighted it really impressed my girlfriend as a Valentine getaway.   I booked a Spa treatment for both of us again these were excellent and very relaxing. The staff throughout were first class from the moment we arrived.  We will return soon! 
4;Was staying for one night in January. Overall this is a really nice place, the only downside is that it was quite cold in the room when I arrived. Couple of hours had past till the temperature was normal. Luckily my room was at the end of the corridor and I didn't hear people walking around.
4;" Our 4 night stay was superb. Would that we could have stayed longer! Everything was of the highest quality; the accommodation, the food & the atmosphere. The friendliness, helpfulness & attention to detail by Hannah, Zoe, Britney and the entire team was first class. Nothing was too much trouble. Dinner and coffee by the log fire each night rounded off each day perfectly. We shall return! "
4; This is a lovely hotel, with excellent standards of service. The food is very good indeed. We stayed for 6 days, and the menu was good for for each evening. We are not fond of creamy puddings, but having said this on the first evening the chef cooked something special for us for every subsequent dinner. Our only comment is that we thought the surcharges on several of the main courses were perhaps a little excessive in view of the prices charged. We very much enjoyed our stay, however, and would not hesitate to return. 
4; Couldn't fault the hotel itself, everything was very good and I have no doubt I'll stay there again. But such close proximity to the football ground means the roads will be very busy shortly before a match - and completely blocked after! Top marks to the staff who were very helpful. 
4; Aspect a warm welcome when you stay at the Crown Plaza, everyone is very welcoming and friendly. Which helped my week stay pleasurable. Although our first night's meal was very slow on arriving. All of the other visits to the restaurant were very good. I can't pick a favourite dish on the menu as they were all excellent. I would however recommend the Crispy Courgettes. I would suggest that you dress light as the whole hotel is very warm. 
4; Efficient check in and a member of staff valet parks your car for you if you like - keys returned later in and envelope. Large warm room/suite overlooking lake Windermere. Massive bathroom and everything very clean and tidy. Monster size bed. Lots of lovely connecting rooms for drinking, dining, informal meetings. Many people taking afternoon tea and I could see the patisserie chefs had been busy with lovely looking (and tasting) cakes.   Had to go for the legendary fabulous fish and chips and was not disappointed. Nor was anyone else in the dining room by the looks of it. Likes the idea and execution of a sharing dessert - bread and butter pudding with home made ice cream.  Great nights sleep and fast check out. Saw other guests return to reception for a photocopy of their map walk for the day to find it done and laminated. Nice touch!  Would wholeheartedly recommend Lakeside. You can see the staff (many local) have been well trained and readily take the initiative. I felt very well looked after. Shame I didn't find time to try out the leisure facilities as the pool looked very inviting. I have already recommended this hotel to my family and friends. If you are looking to visit the lakes this wonderful property should be on your list. 
4; I commend the arrangements made for our Anniversary Dinner for 30 guests on 29 June 2013. The dinner menu , both in its selection by the Chef, and presentation on the table was considered first rate by all present, and the setting in the annexe to the Watermark Restaurant perfect. Service by both Restaurant and Bar staff was of the highest order, and guests staying overnight were impressed by the accommodation provided, some enjoying also the Spa facilities A memorable event for my wife and myself, particularly for my wife who was 'released'.by Basingstoke Hospital where she has been for nine weeks for half a day to attend. 
4;"Having spent 3 nights in the Grange, enabling us to visit the sights of York, it was a bonus to our short break, to be given such superb service. what the hotel lacks in it's need for a face lift is more than made up for in it's service and quality of food. All members of staff must enjoy working there because it showed in the way they treat the guests, nothing was to much trouble, and remember, &quot;a companies best assets go home at night&quot;. yes the rooms whilst being very spacious do need a little lift, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was excellent. The dinner menu gave a good selection and the food was wonderfully prepared and presented. if we return to York, we will make a beeline for the Grange. thank you all, Mike & Rita Brooker"
4; We have just returned after staying at Sopwell House over the weekend and can only have the highest praise for Sopwell House and in particular the management. The room was excellent , clean and modern, as expected at a top class retreat.The service we received at Sopwell House was just excellent from the Spa to the restaurant and the bars.Sopwell House is located in a beautiful location and to have the stay further complimented by great service, room and meals just made our stay that very special.  We had stayed at Sopwell house previously in the past but our recent experience was special. Sopwell House definately has become a premier retreat for the best. We were so impressed with the room , spa facilities, food and service on our return visit that we can only attribute the massive improvements down to better management. Our highest praise must be directed to the Manager Mr Alessandro Conventino and his team. We are definately returning to Sopwell House in the future and look forward.  Sopwell House is a great place to visit and we strongly recommend anyone thinking about visiting to book it you will not regret and will have a great stay.The location is special and as mentioned earlier Sopwell House now also has great management in place. 
4;Thanks to Menzies Cambridge hotel, we had another great weekend in Cambridge. Evening meal on the Friday that we arrived was good. The room was as expected and one important point for us, the breakfasts were well worth the money. This is our third visit (we like Cambridge for a weekend break) and I would think we will be back again!
4; We parked our car at the Hotel and booked our afternoon tea. We went for a walk around the beautiful Sheringham country which has easy access from the hotel grounds. We returned for tea at 4pm. Beautiful rooms. Friendly staff. massive afternoon tea including sandwiches and scones with jam and clotted cream. A great location to end an afternoon. Can't review but looked an excellent place to stay overnight. 
4; This hotel is rated 4* by the AA. It lives up to that promise. It is pleasantly situated in a grassy/wooded area north of Preston based on a victorian house with low level annexes and plenty of parking. The rooms are very nicely fitted out, clean and comfortable with everything one could need. There was a bit of noise at night from an extractor fan but I don't know which room it was in or whether all rooms are equally afflicted. On the downside they charge for internet access. I think at least the first 3 hours per day should be free. The hotel is well equipped for business guests and hosting business functions an conferences, but not everyone in on a business expense account. Nevertheless, there are many good value deals available and despite its rating this hotel is very competitive on price. We paid £71 for a double room including breakfast. The breakfast was pretty standard but with plenty of choice and quite tasty. We did not use the restaurant. There is a large, comfortable bar area open all hours. all the staff were very helpful and courteous. 
4; Just returned for a 3 day break at the Wordsworth Hotel with the family. All I can say is even better than last year, and that was excellent. Food, rooms, facilties and service brilliant. Well done all staff and management you made a family getaway a long weekend to remember. 
4; After reading Tripadvisor I selected this Hotel for a stay of 4 nights. Firstly the Hotel is in a great position close to Torquay harbour, the Sea Front, Restaurants and shopping centre. It also has comfortable car parking and a very relaxed feel with beautiful gardens sun facing, but is in a nice quiet area. What we didn't realise initially was the very warm welcome and ongoing hospitality we would receive for the duration of our 4 night stay.   Roger and Peter were exceptional hosts and took great care in the detail and requirements of their guests. Their staff were very professional but caring and helpful, and on the first morning when my elderly Mother fell ill they couldn't do enough to help and support us. Thankfully my Mother recovered, and i'm sure the warmth and care they showed helped greatly.   We could not fault the Hotel in anyway, from the Bedrooms, to the excellent breakfasts delivered by a lovely lady and the cleaners who were first class in everything they did, and with a smile too.   If you are visiting Torquay this Hotel is a must. Reasonably priced for the standard and care received, my next visit to Torquay will include a stay here. A great big thank you to Roger, Peter and their staff for what turned out to be in the end a wonderful break.
