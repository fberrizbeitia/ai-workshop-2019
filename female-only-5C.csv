-4;No toilet facilities available whilst our girls were playing football had a 15 minute treck back to our apartment to use the toilet - no bins available so there was rubbish blowing all over. Overpriced over cooked and over processed food from 1 burger van available. Girls teams from the football tournament treated like second class citizens - only had time to recognise the boys outstanding play at the trophy ceremony - no time for the girls - announced for all the resort to hear -. Ceiling falling down in room. Ants in kitchen and only the very basic equipment provided.
-4; On arrival everything was as it should be. The receptionist was charming and the entrance was acceptable! The room was one to be avoided at all costs. Room 1001! It was very dark and I mean dark...it might as well have been candle lit! (the lighting was horrendous!) When we walked in the room the noise from the outside main road hit you...not surprising the window was open. Not so bad when we closed it! The curtains were about 6''to short for the window and the lace was grimy! The room was large enough and adequate...But, believe me we never slept a wink...and we were there for 3 nights! The noise was unbelievable from the staff cupboard next door. Specially at about 6 am. The creaking of floor boards from above was unbelievable and last night was just a nightmare... the hotel had a disco/entertainment going on just below our room...we needn't have gone to bed at all...finishing well after midnight ...then there was the noise of the staff clearing away! Harrogate itself is a lovely place and we will go back...but, next time it will be in an holiday inn or a premier lodge hotel! 
-4; Took our daughter and her two young children here yesterday ,as a busy mum she deserved a treat .... I had been to Offley place for afternoon tea about 18 months ago and thought it would be the perfect treat!  The service by the young man was okay but the 'afternoon tea' was embarrasing - stale bread and a selection of cakes worthy of a very cheap frozen food chain !!!!!  I will post the photographs of the offering alongside the pictures from 18 months ago - this place has deteriated significantly . This cost over £70 !!!!! 
-4; in my own personal opinion.......certainly not worth £70 per head!  I have been attending the usual carribbean nights for a few years and althought a bit high on the price, it was worth going for that special occassion, bdays etc....over the years, I have notice that this event has definetely gone down hill, the quality of the food is below average, the food is not very tasty and rather bland lacking that wow effect, in my opinion is more of a work canteen school dinner buffet . Anyways in regards to the new years eve night event, the venue was half empty and full of pensioners (nothing against pensioners bless them but just explain the ambiance) as well as what appeared to be Holiday inn own staff, managers and friends and families of these as well as a few hotel guests/tourists that appeared to have popped down to fill the restaurant, wearing jeans trainers and the clothes they had been wearing through the day, no effort what so ever.....anyways my review on this night is that for new years eve NEVER AGAIN!!! Staff was very friendly, restaurant manager very accommodating and proffessional. 
-4;Me and my husband were really looking forward to our break away for the bank holiday weekend. I have to say we were not happy at all. Firstly I will point out the good points we had a working shower, good WIFI, a TV, comfy bed and the 3 course meal was lovely. Well when we checked in, we had requested a ground floor room when booking as I myself am disabled and have mobility problems, they hadn't reserved us a room at all on the ground floor and we were put on the first floor in room 22 even though I explained when booking about mobility issues. This was awful, the hotel has one very tiny lift, which you can squeeze a small wheelchair in, there is nothing on the website at all about limited access in the hotel, I wonder what would happen if the lift was out of order?. When we entered the room we were shocked, the room was extremely small, dated, decoration was in very poor condition, one of the windows didn't open, the ceiling fan didn't work, the heated towel rail in the bathroom didn't work, and the room was not clean, we could barely get our suitcase and hand luggage in the room. There was barely any room to get around the bed, and there was defently no room to put my wheelchair in, which I was not happy about having to leave it locked in the car in an area we were not familiar with. We then realised the room was missing usual hotel items which you would except in a 4* hotel we had no towels, bottled water, milk for tea or coffee, extra toilet rolls and had to go down to reception to request these items. We were also surprised that there was no mini bar or reading/bedside lights in the room. The room was very hot, the heating was not on and all rooms in the hotel had windows wide open. Dinner was lovely but the staff tried to charge us twice for the meal too. We had a very disturbed night too at around 4am/4.30am we had other guests in the hotel running up and down the corridor slamming doors... a bit of consideration for other people staying in the hotel wouldn't go a miss. Then to top it off in the morning we struggled to get down stairs waiting 10 minutes to use the lift and still couldn't get down so my husband helped me down the stairs so we could have breakfast. Breakfast, there was no organisation at all, there were no staff around or clean tables so we had to clean our own table and my husband got me breakfast which was barely warm. By morning we couldn't wait to leave and go and explore bournemouth. We won't be staying again. I wouldn't recommend it at all, and we will be putting a complaint in about the state of the hotel and the service provided. We can't comment on the spa facilities as we didn't use them as they closed early. The photos of the rooms on the website don't represent the rooms that are provided to guests in the hotel.
-4; I rarely write bad reviews of anywhere. However, the burford bridge hotel's service was really poor. I didn't stay at the hotel but went to sample their afternoon tea, which looked like it would've been very nice. We went to the bar to order but were told to sit down and the waiter would come to us. After 15 minutes he didn't come over but seemed to be loading up a bucket of ice instead. A female waitress walked past and asked if I wanted anything. I asked for a menu. She went to the bar and then came back to me and said someone else would bring me a menu. Another 15 minutes and no one came. There were a lot members of staff on duty but they appeared to be doing very little. I have been to the venue before for a wedding which was very nice. However, the lack of service on this occasion has put me off ever returning. 
-4; We have used Nent Hall over the past 23 years as a special place to eat. Up until now it has always been clean, tidy, friendly and the food (pub or restaurant) great..... What made up for 'the average' menu was made up for the staff..... Naomi being one who went out of her way to make our visit special.   Today was HORRENDOUS........ We were greeted by a female who huffed muttered in a foreign language and treated us as if we were doing her a favour......... speaking to other staff in a foreign language.....It was only when my husband rang the bell on the bar twice.... (she had her back to him playing with the till and then marched off with a dirty look) - The food had to be sent back twice (how can a chef burn scampi & suck the life out of microwave peas)..... On the second return the foreign speaking lady spoke to a equally foreign chap behind the bar who by all accounts thought my complaints very amusing! First two bottles of wine 'unavailable' so went for Rose Tattinger at £70.00 which was eventually served room temperature and only when requested a small wine cooler with a few blobs of ice was supplied. The food was not even up to Motorway food standard..... I will never eat there again..... My favorite restaurant has been turned into a place where nobody cares about the food or the service and customers are obviously ruining their day by coming in and asking for food.....NEVER AGAIN.... AND WE WILL BE TELLING ALL OUR LOCAL FRIENDS, 
-4;" Well where to begin! We chose the Novotel as we were attending a wedding in Bristol, so I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights and 1 room for 1 night. We checked in and all was OK there and we were given rooms 313 and 314 for the 2 night stays and 309 for the 1 night stay. We got into the right hand lift and got stuck, nothing was working on the panel, except for the extremely loud and annoying lift music, I pressed the emergency bell to be greeted by a message &quot;your call is important to us and will be answered as soon as possible&quot;. When someone did answer the emergency bell, we were asked &quot;what's the postcode?&quot;, why would anyone have the postcode of the hotel? We told the operator this and was told to &quot;stop shouting&quot;. We weren't shouting we just couldn't hear ourselves over the lift music. By the end of speaking to the Operator and advising him where we were he said he would send a lift engineer asap. I phoned reception and they came and made an attempt to get us out, but the lift door would only open a tiny bit, which my Husband kept his foot in as it was getting hotter and hotter. A couple were keeping us company as the hotel staff after trying to open the lift doors had disappeared. My Husband kept trying and trying to prize the doors apart when about 20 minutes later they gave, and we were able to get out of the lifts. We weren't even asked if we were OK by the hotel staff, let alone offer us some water or something to just help us with the anxiety of it all. Just to advise you that my Husband went down to the car at 2350 hours and the lift engineer was just arriving, so if we had had to wait for them we would have had to wait for over 2 hours, not a thought that I relish.  When we got into rooms 313 and 314 they were so hot, they were stifling, and that remained the case for the whole weekend. How they can advertise these rooms as air conditioned I do not know, because they most certainly are not. Overall the comfort of the bed is good, but it was just so hot, that even when we switched from the air conditioning to opening the windows there was no difference, the rooms were still uncomfortably hot.   Breakfast on Saturday morning, one word TEPID everything was tepid verging on cold from the coffee to the full English breakfast buffet. I asked for another pot of coffee as it was cold, I told the waiter and he said &quot;the outside of the jugs are cold&quot;, and I told him that no the coffee inside the pots is cold. He went and got me another pot of coffee, but it still wasn't overly hot. The hot breakfast items were tepid, it was horrible. I again told the waiter and he said &quot;I can go and get you some hot breakfast from the kitchen&quot;, why wasn't there hot breakfast items on the buffet?. Another Lady on the table next to us said to a Waitress that she had ordered poached eggs for her breakfast, but she had eaten breakfast, which was cold, and the Waitress replied &quot;there's only one breakfast chef working, and that the breakfast buffet had been sat there for a while.&quot; I not only told the waiters about our cold breakfast items and coffee, but I went and told the Receptionist about it as well as the hotel rooms being so hot, and got nothing apart from a &quot;sorry about that&quot;. Needless to say, we didn't bother with breakfast on Sunday morning.  I came back to the hotel on the Saturday afternoon and the door card wasn't working, to be told &quot;if you keep it next to a mobile it deactivates it&quot;. I only wanted the door card to work, not a lecture, how was I to know, and I hadn't had it next to my mobile on purpose.  On checkout I was asked the mandatory question &quot;was everything OK with your stay?&quot; and I told her no, and the issues that I had had, to be told again &quot;sorry about that.&quot;, nothing was resolved, I wasn't spoken to by anybody who could rectify anything, and to be quite honest the staff didn't really seem to care. So needless to say, I won't be stopping in the Novotel Bristol City Centre again. It's a shame as I like Novotel Hotels in general, but this one was certainly a disappointment and will make me think twice about, which brand of hotel I will stay in in the future. "
-4; Disappointed with the room on arrival as we thought we had booked a larger room with two double beds - not a double room with a pop-up single bed. A dirty black hair garnished our dessert which completley ruined our evening meal. The television ariel was loose so we kept losing our picture and sound. The breakfast was ok apart from when asking for a pot of Earl Grey tea they put one Earl Grey and one English tea bag in together. Whilst at reception to give them feedback I was shocked to hear that a customer was requesting a first aid bag as their son had just cut himself on a sharp edge on the pop-up bed. There was also a complaint about no arrival of newspapers however this was due to them been given the wrong room on arrival (non smoking not smoking) and this was probably why they hadn't gotten their papers as they changed room! What a poor service for the amount they charge - I would not us this Marriott again. 
-4; I arrange to meet an colleague for lunch at the Hilton. I arrive 45 mins before him and agree to wait in the lounge. having sat for 30 mins for service I approached the bar and asked for a tea only to be told to sit and wait for service. I am not used to this level of poor service especially when their prices are top end and car parking extra. Needless to say I will not be going again! 
-4; This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in! The rooms are dated, they leave a bottle of water in your room which you get charged for if you open (for the price of this hotel you would at least expect a free bottle of water!) you also have to pay something crazy like £8 to use the WiFi, again, for the price you are paying free WiFi should at least be included. I paid £15 for a burger in the restaurant (I was expecting something pretty special for this price!), I wasn't impressed, the burger was dry, absolutely no flavour - even the chips were horrible! Service was incredibly slow, and the restaurant was pretty much empty so absolutely no excuse for this.   I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, it is completely over priced, and basically everything about it is awful. I stay in budget hotels all the time and they are far nicer than this ! 
-4;" have been a regular visitor ( accommodation/ non-accommodation/day) for some time but now find myself in an unenviable position: no-one takes my booking!!!! I have tried over the past twelve days to book a day spa: staff don't have the appointment book; they can't confirm a booking;they all say how sorry they are then pass me to someone else who can't take the booking.Despite their reassurances, no-one has emailed me or phoned me to discuss this.Have now given up.Simply not worth it which is a shame for a business "
-4; Having been to Champneys Tring several times I decided to book Henlow as a day spa for my sister and I to celebrate our birthdays. I hoped, as the website leads you to believe, it would be a relaxing luxurious day but I was totally wrong.   The building is old, tired, not clean, and not really conducive to a spa. The changing rooms were small and claustrophobic with very low ceilings. The carpet worn away, and many of the lockers don't work. And there is a serious lack of showers to visitors ratio.   The only water available to drink is from an old water fountain - no cups available (only at one in the treatment area)  With only 1 very small sauna (4 people were too many and 1 had to leave when I went in) and no communal rest areas, there isn't much option of where to relax. Comparing this to Tring as I was, this was very unpleasant.   The gym equipment used in the class was old and outdated, and the gym studio tired and dirty.   Lunch was a further unpleasant experience - the plates were not clean and we had to request a new pile. And a hair was found in my sisters food - which the waiter didn't seem to even apologise for.   Treatments were fine, but the treatment rooms lacking any relaxing atmosphere and in need of redecorating.   All in all, a total waste of money and disappointing coming from a brand synonymous with luxury pampering.   With so many lovely day spas to choose from, I would urge you to book something else - this is not nice at all. 
-4; Stayed here for a spa break with friends and the service was poor as the staff were not helpful in fact very rude. The spa was dirty and in places mouldy around the pool area and changing rooms. There was some sort of rugby tour side staying there and the mess they caused was disgusting and they were out of control - the staff would not do anything to help and the children were actually frightened - we are sure they were drunk! The pool area was supposed to be renovated a year or so ago, but they missed a real opportunity to spruce the place up in the spa - same old showers and nasty 80's fittings look very outdated. Restaurant is overpriced and staff over charged us several times - food was very disappointing and cold - quite foul, on a separate birthday night out. Will never go back here - it is a disgrace to Gloucester. 
-4;We thought we deserved a treat and booked to stay for one night. Our room was absolutely stunning - I think we'd been upgraded somehow as it was huge and with a fantastic, luxurious bathroom. However, the compliments unfortunately end there... This place offers a strange, weird mix of people popping in for a meal or tea fully dressed, whilst others there for a spa break are left feeling uncomfortable walking around in robes and slippers. My hours massage lasted 45 minutes including the time it took for me to get changed before and after, and to make matters worse, following that we thought we'd sit outside and have a coffee, still in our robes only to find ourselves sitting amongst wedding guests in their black-tie and ball-gowns!  Dinner was also a disaster, we had to wait a good 20 minutes before our order was taken and another 30 before the first course arrived - a bottle of wine was given by way of an apology, but really, we felt that was too little too late.  Having had an extortionate lunch in the larger restaurant the day before, we decided to have a lighter snack the next day in the conservatory room, only to find that had been booked for a birthday party and we couldn't go in - we were therefore left with very little option than to have a cream tea in the bar area instead, which again we had to wait what felt like forever to be seated and served. Last but not least there was a mistake on our bill, which was finally rectified by snobby and uninterested reception staff.  It's such a shame, this place has a lot of potential to be a lovely hotel, but advertising themselves as a spa is always going to disappoint anyone booking it for that reason. You just can't have weddings in the same place as people having massages and treatments!
-4; I am writing to share my upset regarding a current Spa day which I purchased as a gift for my Sister for her birthday.  After purchasing the voucher, I contacted the hotel to organise the date. I sent two different emails on two different dates regarding the spa day and I never had a response to either of them. I then contacted the spa and spoke to someone on the phone.  When we arrived at the Hallmark Hotel we realised that the hotel is surrounded by persimmon homes building site. We walked into the hotel and went down to the Reception at the Spa. We noticed the beauty rooms and both felt these were hidden out the way, down a corridor which was filled with boxes. There were no seats or anywhere to wait.  We were greeted by a member of the Spa team and I explained that I had purchased a voucher, which included a spa day, treatment each and lunch. He told us where the pool was and changing rooms and explained that for the lunch we would have to get changed and go back upstairs to the restaurant for this. We had never been to the Hotel before and no one actually showed us to the changing rooms or around the spa. He also explained that once we got to the restaurant if they did not accept our voucher we would have to come back down to the Spa.  We were not offered any towels, robes and slippers and no one gave us any information to say we needed to pay for these. I feel if this is suppose to be a Spa Hotel that these would be included as part of your day.  We went into the changing rooms which I feel are very old and tired and need some work done to them. It was rather busy and hot in there as there was no air conditioning and a few of the lockers were broken or did not have keys. The floor tiles were dirty and the area was not very clean, there was hair on the floor We then had to walk past the Reception area in our swimming wear to get to the pool. The door was rusting and looked like it was hardly on its hinges. My first impression of the pool area was of that of a public swimming pool desperately needing updating and cleaning. The décor was dreadful and half renovated, the bridges were half painted and the no slip mats they had on the floor were filthy. The pool was busy so we decided to go in the Jacuzzi which was freezing cold with no bubbles and no button to turn the Jacuzzi on. The overall spa facilities were inadequate and the pool area was outdated and not completely sanitary. The tiles around the pool area and Jacuzzi appeared to have mould growing in them and the floor around the pool had hair on it.  We both said that we were really sad that the photos of the spa are very deceiving. We decided that we did not want to stay so after spending half an hour at the hotel we went back into the changing rooms, did not even bother having a shower as we felt the place was so dirty and run down that we just got changed and got our stuff and went.  We then ended up spending more money on top of what we had already spent at the hotel to go to another spa for the day as this was my Sisters birthday present and I felt I had let her down as the Spa day I had organised for her was unfortunately not what I thought it was going to be and I was very disappointed.  The spa was nothing like we thought it was going to be and I would not want others to come and hope for a nice spa day at this hotel only to be disappointed. I feel the standard of the spa does not reflect the price the Spa days are advertised at and for what we had to pay for day. The photos on the website must have been taken when the Hotel first opened and are not what the hotel and spa look like now so I think these need to be updated so that people see what the hotel is like now. Our whole spa experience did not live up to the information on the website or pictures. I would not recommend this hotel to any of my family or friends. 
-4;Upon arrival loads of car parking. The place looks very nice, with flowers all around. But entering the pub the staff couldn't be bothered. We found a table and went to the bar to order drinks. The carpets were outraged and grubby and where we sat was grubby and dirty too. The ladies toilets were broken and in a mess and damp smelling. I was pleased to get out of here. We could see the standard of food that was been serverd. Not very good portions or presentation either. We won't be going back .
-4; This hotel is beautifull but is let down by both check in staff and management. Stayed at the weekend booked in at 3pm finally got our room at 5pm after staff tried to sell it again as we wete standing at reception desk. Then when we checked out payment was taken twice which they are now denying management dont reply to emails and we are getting the run around avoid this hotel like the plague. 
-4; This is certainly not a 4 star hotel - should just be scraping in at 3 star. Please note that the food is absolutely disgusting. I will not be staying again. Very disappointing. 
-4; As a treat for a recent anniversary we decided to have a romantic meal and night away at the Cavendish. How I wish we had not bothered.   When we arrived it was a beautiful day and we decided to have a glass of wine in the garden and ordered 2 glasses of house dry white wine from one of the waiters, there were a number of other guests having a drink or afternoon tea in the sunshine. When we came to having our glasses refilled there were no staff around to ask and only when someone eventually came to clear tables did we manage to order another drink, other guests had also commented on how long they had had to wait. Attentive they were not!!!  We ate in The Gallery restaurant which was ok, if i am being really picky the smoked mackerel starter was a bit dry but generally the food was enjoyable.  The cooked breakfast was excellent but is not included in the room price of £219 per night.  We had booked an 'Inn Room' hoping for a bit of luxury with wonderful views, we were not expecting a small pokey, unclean room, 'THAT view over The Chatsworth Estate' was limited beyond belief. The bed was so uncomfortable I had to sleep on the sofa, the decor initially looked ok but on closer inspection the room was very tired had had not been thoroughly cleaned for some time, the bathroom was not much better with a thick layer of dust on those out of the way places.  When we checked out I did remark on the state of the room and the fact I had to sleep on the sofa but paid the bill anyway. They apologised and said they would let management know!!! It was only on closer inspection that we noticed we had been charged £17.20 for the first 2 glasses of house dry white wine we had had the previous day!!!! The second 2 glasses had been charged at £9.40. We are not penny pinchers but did feel £8.60 for a glass of run of the mill wine was unreasonable. I felt i did nothing but complain about our romantic anniversary night away but for a grand total of £468 it was an expensive exercise and not something we will be repeating.  For cleanliness and a wonderful bed Premier Inn here we come, no they don't have airs and graces but for £29 per night we can opt for a chauffeur driven car with excellent food somewhere else. 
-4; I took my mother for a special treat to enjoy an afternoon tea at the prestigious Queens Hotel.  We were taken through to sit at a table in the chilly conservatory, passing the comfy chairs and the open fire, and presented with a menu. I say menu but actually this was a poor quality piece of A4 paper that had been photocopied at an angle and poorly listed an either sweet or savoury option. I mistakenly thought afternoon tea was a mixture of both. We ordered and asked for a mixture of both the sweet and savoury items. I must say the Assam tea was lovely, nicer out of a fine China cup, not the big breakfast cafe style cup we had. Then two three tiered cake presentation stands arrived, I have to admit to being quite excited expecting a delicious array of items, the sandwiches looked nice on the bottom saucer and the single scone sat in the middle of the second saucer, slightly sad, then the top tier..... I had the savoury top tier, half a mini quiche, mini Pork pie, mini pasty and mini slice of sausage role. My mother had the stand with the sweet top tier, one small macaroon, two tiny squares of cake and a glass with Eton mess. To accompany this we had a huge bowl of piccalilli, massive amount of clotted cream, jam and lemon curd. I've honestly had better at my local garden centre for a fraction of the price. What had promised to be a treat and special afternoon with my mother was hugely disappointing and certainly not worth £35. The mother and daughter on the table next to us felt equally disappointed. Such a shame, feel totally let down.  The macaroon was lovely shame it was the size of a 50p and i had to share it! 
-4; The room they tried to give my partner and I was so tiny, for the price !!. Coving was coming off the ceiling. Wallpaper peeling off, stains on the carpets, both in the roon, on the stairs and the corridor. Ordered 2 drinks at the bar in the afternoon, mine being a cocktail and my partner a pint of beer. The bar staff decided she would serve the beer but infact made me wait for my cocktail once we had paid her for our drinks and decided to serve 6 people that had walked into the bar 5 minutes after us because she said the cocktail would take her 10 minutes to make. So, I had to wait 20 minutes for my drink (perhaps because I was only one person and not 6). So, the room, the service and the cleanliness is worth perhaps a 2 star. I won't ever stay again and will definately persuade my friends to stay next door in the Holiday Inn for less than half the price 
-4; Nice hotel building with nice rooms. However to say the staff and management are a waste of time is an understatement. I stayed for 2 nights paying £120 per night, when arriving back from work on day two I went up to my room and the key didn't work, then somebody came to the door and said who are you. I went down to reception and it turns out I was let the only disabled room in the hotel and they had to move me to another room to accommodate a disabled person. I spoke to the manager and he said there was no contact number to inform me, I said why didn't you call expotel who it was booked through and they would have called me. Or even better still be better organised and not let me a disabled room. He was useless and just kept saying sorry and clearly was passive to the situation.  So basically it was poorly organised and when things did go wrong because of this poor setup, they couldn't be bothered to make any effort to contact me to let me know. They just moved all of my belongings themselves to the new room and left me to find out the hard way that I no longer had the room.  Believe me I will not be staying here again and will activly tell my colleagues who will be working in Croydon to avoid this hotel. 
-4; The location is without a doubt stunning and the building beautiful. The meal i the evening was very expensive and nothing out of the ordinary. What was really shocking and disappointing was that on returning home we discovered that we had been charged twice and they had taken the best part of £600 out of or bank account. They were very matter of fact about it when challenged and whilst it was resolved fairly quickly there was little in the way of an apology or compensation for the inconvenience. I certainly will not return based on this as it spolit what could have been a lovey weekend 
-4;I stayed at this hotel last weekend, August 2013 with my daughter and father. My father is disabled and there were no facilities at all to accommodate him. His room was on the first floor, no lifts. The bannister to get up and down didn't extend to the bottom two steps, leaving it impossible for him to do on his own. I did make a complaint to the hotel who told me it was a listed building and they couldn't accommodate disabled visitors. I find this appalling and unacceptable. My father really struggled but we stayed as it was the hotel hosting his grand-daughter's wedding.
-4;i was so upset when i arrived here, i booked a spa break for my friends 40th birthday as a surprise, we got there, staff rude and disinterested, told us main direction of room, nothing about the spa and where it was, not surprising when later we found the hotel is just attached to a leisure center, kids pool, no lazy rive or lounging by the pool as described, kids in and out of sauna and steam room, staff not willing to arrange dressing gowns, towels are rented by the day. no treatment available to book as the leisure center is for general public to book not hotel guests and was booked even though we were told book when you arrive and get 10 percent off. so we left, i pre paid £150 for a night in a premier inn standard hotel with a pool next door. gutted, i felt so embarrassed as this was a gift, i bought in good faith and was supposed to be a special one off treat :( please dont waste your money this in not a spa hotel!!!! also facing a dry ski slope so full off kids running around indoors, didnt stay long enough to judge evening meal and breakfast, even thought i paid for it already and those lovely pics you have seen of modern black glass welcoming exterior?, is one panel on the front of a very basic leisure centre, check my pics for reality.....
-4; I stayed at the Great House for my brother's wedding. Stayed in the original building in room no. 14. Was woken by a loud scream on the morning of the wedding as my room mate found 2 wasps in her bed. As this was at 6am, we decided to wait until 8 to alert reception. However in between that time, I trod on a dead wasp on the carpet and got a nasty sting on the bottom of my foot. The reception staff were helpful - they said that the room had been inhabitable for a few months but had got people in the week before to get rid of the nests and therefore deemed the room safe again. They apologised and allowed us to move to room 16. To our embarassment though, room 16 was still occupied by the newly weds from the day prior!   Eventually, once unoccupied we were able to move, although this was literally about half an hour before my brother's ceremony. I ended up sleeping on a camp bed too.  We voiced our dissapointment on check out and were assured that if we sent a written complaint we would receive a refund. However both myself and my father sent complaints and have heard nothing. My advice is if you have to stay there make sure you stay in the new block - as the original building is not fit for humans! 
-4;I've been staying at cedar court for a total of four weeks due to work commitments. I can honestly say this hotel needs its star rating reviewed! Where do I start? The food menu is very basic and some days it wasn't even cooked properly, it's loop warm when served. For a 4* hotel you would expect more. Now to the rooms, if you stay on the third floor you will see the rooms are small and they have major issues with the hot water, on more than one occasion the water was brown and you couldn't guarantee you would have hot water when you need a shower in the morning, when I contacted reception about the water issue they said it's down to the plumbing as it's a very old building. I don't think that is a good enough excuse for poor facilities, if you stay at a 4* you expect 4* facilities. The rooms are also noisy down to the extractor fans in the bathrooms so don't put the light on before you want to sleep. Also the heating is poor and I seen people getting extra heaters in the rooms as they were too cold. One thing I would say is that staff are really friendly and open to comments, but not sure what they do with those is another thing as people keep saying the same things over and nothing changes.
-4; Nice enough room but an interconnection door and sqwaking girls in the adjoining room who woke us up at 6 am shouting and no regard for other guests mean we will not use this hotel again. The shouting and noise carried of for hours so not a place for a peaceful break and expensive for what it is. A taxi into Bristol is about £20-£25. 
-4; 19th May, 2011, we had a very special event to celebrate and hoped that “36 on the Quay” would be the perfect place. Unfortunately, we requested the tasting menu but were told the restaurant was particularly busy and the tasting menu was not available. When we arrived, we had to wait what seemed like an eternity before we were greeted and taken to our table. The restaurant seemed really quiet with only a couple of tables occupied (so we were even more disappointed that the tasting menu was not available as the reason given was the restaurant was particularly busy). The final disappointment came during dessert, when we found cellophane wrapping in the dessert. When we pointed this out, there was hardly a reaction or apology – I would have expected a lot more as this was such an unpleasant experience and could have been highly dangerous. We will not be visiting again 
-4; Took my grandparents here for afternoon tea, as they had received it as a Christmas gift. When we arrived, we were brought lukewarm tea.It was at this point I noticed the not so clean and unmatching cutlery. I'm not fussy, but for somewhere so expensive and fancy-looking, you expect a certain standard. We ordered the more expensive afternoon tea for 3, and one gluten free. It took so long to arrive we were sure they had to be making the scones fresh. During this time, I asked for decaf tea, but was brought red bush. When the food eventually arrived, the gluten free selection was about half of that of each normal selection. it did not contain any of the cakes, being only sandwiches and scones. The scones were dry and crumbly, the sandwiches on very average, slightly dry bread. The crusts had obviously tried to be cut off, but had been done messily and poorly. Some of the salmon and cream cheese sandwiches had no cheese, and all of them had about a cm of cold, claggy butter. The brownies were dense and at least a few days old. The carrot cake light, but lacking taste with a grainy texture. When we went to leave, they tried to make us pay for an extra person. The entire time the staff were chatting loudly in the corner. Would have been better in most highstreet cafes. Very disappointed and somewhat embarrassed to bring my grandparents here. 
-4; Beware of this Hotel they seem to have amnesia if there's a problem. Having booked a Saturday night treat we arrived a little before their 3pm check in. However the room wasn't ready so we left our bags and went into Stroud. I noted that our bags were immediately carried to the room as we drove away.   On our return about 9.30! We were shown to room 29. A so called Upgraded refurbished room. The bed was soft and lumpy and my partner sank to the floor on sitting on it. The bath had pink marks all over one side and looked old and tired. The bed cover had stains the room was dark and the view a stone wall.   The duty manger claimed it was just a soft bed and did concede the bath was dirty. They offered another room overlooking the carpark also with a very soft/soggy bed and a third that was only a basic room be very careful they are incapable of excepting or apologising when customers are unhappy. As for wifi it was very slow and kept disengaging. Apparently signal is a problem according to reception! 
-4; NOT somewhere to go for a special occasion where you want to be treated with the attention you deserve when paying such high rates. It was obvious to us the staff were over worked and clearly couldn't cope with the few customers they had. Everything about the service and the atmosphere screams cutting corners to save/make money, the tables are so close together, to SQUEEZE as many people in as possible into such a SMALL SPACE, i felt like i knew the couple next to us intimately when we left. No care or attention to their customers. It probably wouldn't have been half as bad if they have paid to have enough staff working! But CLEARLY MONEY is ALL that matters here. clearly rely on a high turnover of people as they certainly cant reply on people ever coming back. 
-4; Hotel in arrival looked amazing , staff were lovely , checking in was a nightmare it took half an hour and we were the only ones checking in !!!  The room was tiny , the phone didn't work , we ordered room service at 11.15pm and finally got it at 1 am , it had been left outside and no one knocked to say it was there !!  The shower door leaked everywhere . There were no bedside lamps , there was only one main light . The fridge wasn't on either .  Breakfast was dire !!!! There hardly anyone eating and lots of staff ignoring us and not seating us , there was no food ready on the buffet there were no glasses for juice and no bread for toast or butter !!!! When we asked for food the manager rolled her eyes and said chef can't keep up !!!! .  This is only scratching the surface of what went wrong .  We had 2 drinks in the bar but were charged £82 !!!!!  We complained and were told they would refund our whole stay and we are still waiting !!!!  This was a birthday treat for my terminally ill friend and it was ruined .   
-4;im a single parent and booked a room with 2 days to legoland ,(my sister talked me into it as she was takeing her son as well .)  on arrival the man on reception told me he needed my card to Authorize my payment which had already gone out of the bank on the 19th , he promised that he wouldnt take anymore just hotel policy , we were there at the proper book in time only to be told our room wasnt ready , when it was we went to the lift while my sister booked in , arriveing at our room it wasnt what i asked for my son is 15 and im 50 they had given me a double bed , i called down to tell them and they took about half hour to change it , we had no mini bar and the kettle didnt work ,which i couldnt change till the next day  at breakfast the next day the man in charge who takes your room number was rather rude and we felt we shouldnt have been there , we booked out at 10am , the next day my eldest son went in to town and i told him to take some money out of my account , only to find the hotel had taken 174.48p and had taken my overdraft , i had a bad throat infection and my sister called them for me , not one person would give thier name and she eventually got the hotel manager , who said it was a human error /computor , and it was taken for mini bar and sundrys , after loads of calls and no apologys they said my money would be back in my account , i now have to pay for my overdraft and missed a direct debit , what i dont understand is the amount they took when the room was 139.38p so this hotel cost me £300 for one nite , what a joke , the staff need training  not just to answer a phone but the attitude of them i found to be poor , they didnt ask my sister for her card , why do it to me . all in all a very bad experiance and if id have known the holidayinn was opposite id have stayed there
-4; We paid a considerable amount for the large suite, which was pictured in a certain way and the room we were given was no where near as good as the one pictured. We were told we should have requested that exact room (the website doesn't give you the option to see which suite is which). We actually came at 10.30am to ask when the room would be ready and we're told it wasn't ready, again not at all mentioned which room. In the end we were offered a small reduction in the room but weren't allowed the room we actually wanted (as someone had got there earlier to reserve it). Overall would never return and disappointed by the customer service I received. Would have expected something much better considering the reputation and price paid 
-4; The Grand sadly is not grand anymore. After a return visit after ten years, how sad to see this lovely old establishment so tatty and unloved. The pillows were smelly, the decor of the whole place was tired and unloved. So disappointing. 
-4; I booked my client in for 3 nights and we did plan on having drinks / dinner etc here too. My client had travelled on an 18 hour flight to Leeds and so needed to check in 2 hours early prior to a meeting (we would have paid for this - money wasn't an issue). I called ahead several days prior to double check that it would be ok to check in early and they said it should be fine and we should just turn up on the day.  On arrival we were brusquely informed that all the computers were down so they couldn't even see if there were any rooms free and we would have to come back at 3pm. There was no negotiation possible and it was said in a manner which blatantly indicated they couldn't care less and the conversation was closed.   I subsequently cancelled all 3 nights online and walked my client across to the much more obliging Malmaison who were delighted to take the booking.   If early check in isn't possible they should have just said when I called initially and saved me the embarrassment of taking my client there.   I won't be booking / recommending for business use again as but I doubt they even care! It's a great shame as the bar's really nice but I'm loathe to go back! 
-4; Sady I found this Hotel to be dirty and the staff very rude and unhelpful... considering this was supposed to be a romantic break away that we had very much been looking forward to! the rude attitude of the staff and the run down filthy room spoilt things for us a little...(we complained about the state of the room and was spoken to very rudely by the staff who really could not of cared less about the dusty smelly room they had shoved us in!).:-( we will not be staying here again.. we come to Brighton loads and usually choose to stay in the Hotel Du Vin but they seem to of taken the eye off the ball recently a let what was once a decent Hotel slip down the pan some what!! Brighton has plenty of great cheaper Hotels to stay in and we look forward to sampling those in the future.... don't waste a fortune on rude treatment and sub standard rooms by staying here!! 
-4; I attended a wedding here in August 2016. The day was sunny, family and friends were excellent company, the location stunning. However, the service was awful. Some of the staff were very friendly, pleasant and helpful, and tried their best but were not coordinated from management, and some were just miserable and barely cracked a smile and did not seem to want to help. Having been involved in hotels and service industry myself it stood out that there were panic in certain areas, some jobs had not been done in time, wine had not been stocked up, bar staff were not trained properly. The time taken between serving different courses was so long it was astonishing, and the food was cold. If you want a lovely wedding room, stunning wedding pictures and a nice champagne reception, get the hotel to do it, and then get in outside caterers for the food and drink!! I really enjoyed the wedding because of the people and the location, but not the food or service. It was £4 for a single VERY SMALL cup of coffee!! Rip off! It took 20 minutes from ordering it to receiving it. Management need to be aware of who is watching and judging them on everything. Food portions need to reflect that this is Cumbria, and people actually like to eat, and coffee needs to be in a pot with cold milk unless hot is requested. Step up Armathwaite, and be the best you can be, and make Cumbria proud!! Don't be cheapskates, buy local, cook properly and do the right thing. Service is everything. 
-4; My friends and I were planning a relaxing spa vacation to celebrate some birthdays and having read reviews about Frimley thought it would be the perfect place. We booked a room about a month in advance and then roughly 2 weeks before the date went to make reservations at the spa...but the phone just rang and rang day after day with no response! We called reception several times and were told that the receptionist would personally go to the spa and ensure that they replied to us and we never heard back (this happened 3 times). It ended up that we had 1 week until our stay and a combination of the appalling customer service and the fact that we still hadn't heard from the spa caused to decide to cancel. We ended up going somewhere in London (near where we live) so it was less of a vacation but at least the hotel replied! 
-4; The good bit: Beautiful country location, looks lovely on the outside Staff were polite and helpful The dinning area and lounge looked lovely, modern and clean  The bad bits:  Our room: when I entered I didnt know if to laugh or cry Dirty, old, out dated possibly 1960s 1970s Im not great on years and style but this was possibly from my childhood years Dirty marked bedding  The matress was shockingly too soft and the only way to get off the bed was to roll out Dirty, stained bathroom with a brown stain in the toilet and a not too nice brown hand smear on the wall (hopefully it was just brown make up)   Having paid £115 for the toom I was desperatly saddened by what we were given. I reported this to reception who were very helpful and apologetic offering us the choice of 2 other rooms, although they were slightly better they were still over priced for the condition of them and trying the matresses I still had the concern that they were way too soft and would leave us with serious back touble the next day, I did question why such soft matresses would be used to which I was told most people prefer a soft matress, I have to say I have never laid on anything quite so soft in my life and I am not new to hotel stays.  We felt it was that bad even with an offer of a negotiation on the room rate that we left and hurried that evening to book a room in a premier inn 
-4; Having spent an hour on the phone to the newly appointed 'central reservations team' I feel it is only right to share what a terrible experience this was.  Despite the fact I was booking for 6 people and spending over £1000 - this hotel were not accommodating and could not despite me being transferred around over 12 times let me speak to a manager or even someone actually based in the hotel.  Will not go into all the details as you can imagine after an HOUR on the phone I have so many twists. But to summarise - I have cancelled the entire booking and as an events manager of a number of years will ensure that not only do none of my global colleagues use this hotel but that no one I know uses Hilton again!!! 
-4; We arrived at this hotel at 3pm this afternoon and had to leave 5 hours later... The staff were friendly and helpful but the rooms were filthy and the food served in the main resteraunt was disgusting! To the point where i wanted to ask the chefs if they actually looked or smelled what they were cooking.  The pillows in the room were stained and i couldnt walk ariund the room without shoes on because the floors were filthy!  Overall really disappointing and we left at 8.30pm the same day! 
-4; Having booked this as part of a spa day break for my mum and myself to wind down after working all of christmas i was really looking forward to a pamper day but instead was left completely dissappointed. booked on the 21st Jan I after having looked on the website I asked to book two extra treatments for me and my mum but were told to call back nearer the time. Never the time being 4 days prior I was then told that all the treatments were fully booked and I could not add on anything. When asked if I could cancel the booking I was told I had to still proceed with the day because it was inside of 7 days. Completed reluctant to attend we try to make the best of a bad situation. Arrived and got settled into the spa surroundings, was chilling by the pool area and was greeted by 3 maintenance workers all peering inside trying to fix equipement, (far from discreet) also maintenance work was going on inside the relaxation room. The corridors were freezing cold. Very tired and shabby and really needs to be renonated. Having lunch included in our package, this actually was very nice, however the young waitress serving did not have a clue was she was bring to the table both with main or dessert. Credit to charlotte on the desk who seemed to be the only competent member of staff. Shall not be returning. And as a goodwill gesture I am surprised you didn't allow us to cancel our booking before we arrived given the circumstances. 
-4; My husband booked this hotel for a surprise wedding for me - he spent months working so hard to save for and organise our special day. The staff at the hotel did not help him at all, they were unhelpful to say the least - they conned him out of large sums of money at the last minute and left him in a position where he had no choice but to go ahead and give me our special day. Not only was my husband ripped off and treated appallingly, our guests were ripped off, overcharged for 'apparently' special room rates. We only realised after the event, we had been charged double for drinks, compared to the other side of the bar with non wedding guests. The honeymoon suite was a joke - the bathroom was awful with noisy broken fans. Don't get me wrong, at the end of the day, our wedding day was incredibly special because of the vows we exchanged and shared, making a lifetime commitment to each other in front of friends and family - however I urge others not to waste their money - I am gutted for my husband. 
-4; I don't know where to begin with this company. Firstly the rooms are dirty, as you may or may not know butlins is well known for parting at the weekend! .. after effects are terrible!.. what I mean is when I got settled into my room I decided to have a look around the room- Which wasn't the cleanest or the most hygienic. Saw we had a kettle, as I opened it up to pour some water into it, I was shocked to find Human Fasces ... . I could not believe what I saw and still to this day I'm shocked. Not only that I saw and heard numerous times Managers/ supervisors bad mouthing there staff who I felt really sorry for as all staff I encountered was absolutely lovely and so helpful. In fact if it wasn't for them I would of left the day I found the Fasces! Also its very expensive for what it was for a weekend! I could of booked a trip to Spain for a week for the price we paid! I did put in a customer complaint after all of this happened and all we got was 'Were very sorry' ... I'm sorry Butlins but I am extremely disappointed with the way they deal with customer complaints and the way the company works as a whole! I would not advise this place to anyone. Ino it sounds like I just write bad reviews but I promise you I write good reviews too! and this is the only bad review I have ever made about any hotel or place! Please please please listen and don't waste your money and time :) I hope Butlins see this review! and I really hope they take this in consideration for the future!  Just to let you guys know we paid £350 for me and my boyfriend for a weekend here ... We paid £680 each to go to Barbados for two weeks! for a lower standard place then butlins and it was truly the best holiday ever! .. so just rethink what your booking! :) 
-4; With its restaurant having just received a coveted second AA rosette for cuisine, my foodie boyfriend and I felt sufficiently enticed to book a superior room at Grovefield House on a DBB basis for one night only. In sharp contrast to the aesthetically challenged town of Slough which it neighbours, we were initially impressed by the plush, well manicured grounds surrounding the hotel, and the apparently refurbished Victorian manor house itself. Despite having to navigate our way through an obstacle course of wedding guests who were occupying most of the communal areas of the hotel, our expectations as we made our way to reception remained high.  Eager to get to our refurbished room and having booked the hotel purely on the basis of its restaurants reputation, you can perhaps imagine our shock when the receptionist politely informed us that, despite having booked our room on a DBB basis some 3 weeks prior, we would not be able to dine in the hotel’s restaurant. The wedding party, as the receptionist explained, would be occupying all dining areas of the hotel that evening and the best the hotel could offer would be room service and sandwiches! When I complained about the lack of any kind of communication to forewarn us that this would be the case, I was informed there was ‘nothing they could do.’ An eventual ‘option’ fielded by the duty manager, by means of recompense, was a free taxi into Slough where we would have to pay for our own food! Without wishing to sound too critical of Slough you don’t need to be Gordon Ramsey to understand our bitter disappointment at this suggestion.  We are assuming the wedding party had been arranged and booked many months prior to the event and that, despite the knowledge their restaurant would be unavailable to the normal guest, the hotel was still happy to advertise a DBB rate on laterooms.com. Such a basic oversight would be unforgivable in any no frills 2 * hotel, but to have to make a journey to a ‘destination’ restaurant in a supposed 4* establishment only to be told you will be eating room service is nothing short of appalling.   Although I cannot comment on the standards of the rooms themselves as we left shortly after arriving, I would implore anyone to take note of both my advice and those of other Tripadvisor reviewers to be incredibly wary of staying at this hotel at least during a wedding function. Chances are you will be made to feel an unwelcome distraction from the hotel’s real priority in servicing the needs of its clearly lucrative primary operation as a wedding venue. 
-4; First the good the location is great with plenty of friendly wildlife! Now for the bad we had to pay £21 for an entertainment ticket for 4 adults in order to buy overpriced coffees and beers. The singers are amateur and dreadful with no personality. The food is likewise overpriced (I would recommend eating at the pub at the entrance to the park £9.95 for 2 courses as opposed to £12.95 in the spitfire bar) and what did the £21 get us.. Answer nothing! The crazy golf for instance is £4 per person for an hour. Last night we were asked for our entertainment ticket on entering, buying a coffee, ordering food, re entering the place and finally trying to buy bingo tickets! I would appreciate an answer as to what we actually paid for? No wonder the place was virtually empty and the park full of miserable people! 
-4; A family party to celebrate my sister's Golden Wedding was spoilt by the total lack of service and lack of care in preparing our meals. Considering that we had been asked weeks beforehand to choose all three courses from the menu it would have been reasonable to expect that each course would be ready to serve when required. Instead some of us sat watching our food get cold while waiting for others to be served. In the end tactful conversations took place so that we could eat our now tepid food while others waited. Then we waited again for ages between courses. The worst thing was that none of the staff cared!! Nobody came to ask if everything was OK. We were left feeling embarrassed for my sister and her husband who were paying for the fiasco. I had the summer pudding for dessert. It was layered bread dipped in fruit juice with a teaspoonful of fruit added. Some of the bread was still white - that's how dry it was. Nobody ate it, yet once again nobody asked if there was a problem when they cleared the plates away. There was a wedding that evening - perhaps they had all the attention, We had three seemingly untrained waitresses to serve 20 people.  We stayed in the hotel overnight. My sister had booked three rooms, one double and two twin-bedded rooms. This was done months beforehand. When we went to our rooms we found that they were all double rooms, not suitable for our needs. Nothing was said when we were given the keys. When we complained a twin-bedded room was found and a single bed was placed at the foot of the double bed in another room. This left very little room to move. We were glad we were staying for only one night. It is not what you expect when you have booked well ahead and are paying £115. I spent the next 3 nights at a Travelodge and had much more room to move. In contrast the breakfast the next morning was good and the staff could not have been more attentive or efficient. The breakfast room was also much more pleasant than where we had been placed the night before. 
-4;" My Stay at myhotel chelsea is one I would never do again, the staff were accomodating and freindly however the breakfast was very small and not alot of choice and it took forever just to get toast!! I was staying on the 2nd floor and the noise level was terrible the house cleaning service kept waking me up even though I had put the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign up and the cleanliness of the hotel in general was appauling whoever the operations manger is should pay more attention to detail. I would not refer anyone to this hotel not even my worst enemy the reception staff were ok but were very rude and they never explained the rates system and the cost was £120.00 more I paid but it wasnt worth it and the food was terrible the bar was cold and uninviting the staff made no effort to make conversation with me at all so this hotel is terrible I wouldnt reccomend this hotel to anyone try somewhere anywhere different "
-4; We stayed here on Easter weekend as we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary. We got to our room and discovered we had separate beds when we had booked a Kingsize. That wasn't a real issue and we thought it wasn't something that bothered us enough to complain about as we only used the room as base after a night out. The rooms were very dated and were not the standard I was used to from a Marriott. When it was time to go to sleep we realised that we were right behind the lift shafts and all we could hear all night was the lifts going up and down. Not what you expect when you have spent a lot of money on what you hoped would be a decent hotel. The lifts are dangerous, we went down in one and it started shaking and felt like it had gone into freefall. The staff were friendly so I couldn't complain about that.   However when we got home I made a complaint to the Marriott and their reply was that they hadn't had any complaints about the noise from the lifts before and they'll make a note for next time we stay. We won't be staying again so there's no need to bother. 
-4;This hotel is truly terrible. We made a late booking by showing up the the hotel on a Friday evening of a long weekend and were booked into a room. We were not told there was a wedding reception that evening and our room was in very close proximity. The horrendous noise continued until well past 1pm and the people at the front desk refused to move us to another room. I have traveled globally and it was truly the worst room and service I've ever experienced. If you are booking here make sure to ask if they are hosting a reception and where your room will be in proximity as there is literally no sound proofing in the hotel rooms. Besides this the beds (two singles pushed together) were shabby and had exposed velcro and staples on the side that scraped my leg! I have never bothered complaining about a hotel on trip advisor before but this one is so bad I have to warn others. Perhaps try staying at another B&B in the area, I'm sure you would have a more relaxing stay!
-4; The facilities were very outdated. We found six dead flies on the floor, as the window was kept open. When we asked for them to clean, the receptionist apologised for this and gave us free drinks at the bar while they hoovered the room, only for us to return with the dead flies still scattered on the floor. The air freshener was plugged in into the socket, that I had to unplug, as the smell was overwhelming and I couldn't sleep. However, for the rest of the time, it smelled even worse, (like a toilet ) which explains why the window was kept open and the freshener was plugged in. It was my graduation day (and I paid extra at this time of the year as it is very busy) and I brought all my family from abroad, hoping that it would be a nice experience for them. However, I will never come back to this place again and now I know why The Palace Hotel has such a bad reputation. Don't recommend it, rather will suggest to look at the Old Hall Hotel.  +The receptionist was nice and took sympathy with our situation at the time. 
-4; The customer service at this hotel is extremely poor, they fail to get back to you when requested and are very unhelpful.  For a hotel that claims to be part of the reputable Macdonald Hotels and Resorts brand their staff are despicble 
-4; We stayed in room 402, on arrival the room was freezing. Attempted to contact Reception, Housekeeping and Duty Manager via telephone no answer! Had to get ready in a freezing cold room. Reported the issue to Reception before going out for the evening and advised a heater would be put in the room whilst we were out for the evening.  On our return the at 11.00pm the heater hadn't arrived - room still freezing! Again reported this to reception who delivered a heater up to the room.  Next morning, we made a complaint to the Duty Manager, who went to explained that the heater hadn’t been delivered as the we hadn’t left our room number! This was not the case we had provided the room number and two members of the front desk team insisted we hadn’t – I don’t like to be made out to be a lair! 
-4; Certainly not the 'experience' we were hoping for. One swimming pool freezing, and the other one cold. The men's changing room was adjacent to the freezing pool - and equally freezing. The toilet in the men's changing room resembled something from a 1970's car ferry. The ladies changing room you couldn't swing a cat in - fortunately I was the only person using the changing room - it had no changing cubicles and one shower and one toilet. Every sunlounger in the 'relaxation room' was taken (there weren't that many) - and in any case it was too dark to read in there. Part of the bench in the aromatherapy cave wasn't working - and everybody was squeezed in one end. No hooks for hanging bathrobes/towels, consequently everybody's towel/robe was strewn over the very few plastic chairs. We arrived at approximately 11.30 a.m. and left for our afternoon tea at around 12.15 - and then left the hotel. Didn't want to stay there a minute longer. 
-4; Stayed here for a mates Hen Do.   The Good:  Great location as it is close to the town centre. The room was a good size and appeared to be clean. While friends of mine had issues with their air con working, ours seemed to work a treat. I was also pleasantly surprised at the quality of the breakfast, enjoyed it immensely.  The Bad:  Whilst I am only going to mention one point, it effectively null and voided all the positives I would have liked to have taken away. That being, I became bed bug grub on both nights I stayed. Woke up each morning having being feasted on overnight, and having an adverse reaction to them has provided me with some most unwelcome souvenirs of my stay.   Whilst the front of house staff were pleasant in dealing with my complaint, they seemed unequipped to deal with it and I did not know how to respond when I was sheepishly asked 'What do you want me to do about it?'.   Given that I reported this to the front of house staff, I would have expected to have had them take my details and contact me later on to discuss my issue. Altogether, pretty poor imho. 
-4; our 6 month olds life was put at risk when the cleaners had left descaler in the kettle,i made the bottles up as usual my son drank about 1 oz of this ,then i noticed the milk had seperated ,luckely he refused to drink more than he did,i could have fed him during the night when it was dark and not noticed anything wrong with the bottles,or he could have been younger and drank all of it,i hate to think what could have happened,we had to take him to the local hospital,where we spent 4 hours waiting for him to be checked over,this was day one of our holiday,butlins gave us £50 in vouchers to spend on the resort,we have found this disgusting ,and are now waiting to see what they are going to do about it,i would hate to see this happen again to another family,this was the 5th year running we have been as we always thought it was a safe enviroment for our children. 
-4; OMG!  Its getting worse, the tired decor the carpets the furniture all the same from two years ago and it was in need of replacing then.  the restaurant in the morning is called a buffet. it basicly means help yourself luv cuz nobody will serve you. i also had this misfortune of meeting kirsty again although to be fair she was great with the kiddies as she called herself goofy the horse and run around the reception area when it was busy pretending to gallop and neighing like a goofy horse. All the other guests didnt find it funny at all but we did. 
-4; Very disappointing stay. Room was very small for a double, smaller than a standard double. Had dinner in hotel were promised a free bottle of wine with a three course meal. Had two courses and could not stomach another course. Risotto was disgusting, egg was hard, should have been runny, risotto was tasteless, lots of it, but left majority. Did mention to the waiter that it was not good. Heard shouting from the kitchen but no apology and still charged for it. (I later complained and had the money for this course refunded.)  Asked Reception if we did in deed have a double room and they moved us. Why not upgrade people when they arrive. It makes good business sense, and would have saved them changing and cleaning two rooms!  Could be a goldmine but need to improve big time. Prime location, very little immediate competition and some great staff, undermined by the bad! 
-4; We arrived at the hotel only to find our room hadn't been cleaned. The bin in the bathroom was full of someone else's rubbish with a used tampon on top to greet us, the bath and shower screen were filthy! After complaining to reception the room was cleaned promptly. We had booked dinner at The Oliver's Restaurant at 8, we had eaten here before, always with excellent food. But this time the food was appalling. Our starter of scallops were verging on raw and our steak arrived very rare although we asked for medium/well. The waiter took this away to cook this a little more but in doing so the rest of the food on the plate dried out and the veg on the table became stone cold. The orange creme brûlée was more like a curdled cream. It wasn't set and wasn't at all nice. We were so disappointed, and then the waiter charged us, although we had already paid for the meal within the booking.  Finally, on the Easter Sunday, I got stuck in the lift between the 2nd and 1st floors, only to find that the emergency telephone in the lift wasn't working. I was very scared and getting just a little claustrophobic. The engineer finally released me after a very long 15 minutes. Although our booking was until Monday, we left on the Sunday as we couldn't stand it any longer. Also the majority of the guests are quite elderly so if your under 50 I wouldn't think this is the place for you  
-4;" We arrive to the &quot;spa&quot; hotel and it turns out that all treatments are booked. There are 15 other people on the waiting list which rules out our chances to have any treatments during our 2 day stay. When we decide to go to the swimming pool we are welcomed by an overfilled Jacuzzi and a swimming pool where the volume reminded us about a children's party. The hotel is obviously more focused on money than making sure their visitors get a pleasant visit.  We also called for a wake-up breakfast.....this never showed up. "
-4; On my recent visit, I found the reception staff very welcoming and helpful, but that's where it ended! My friend, her 10 year old daughter and I, tried to order a drink at the bar and were completely ignored by the foreign bar staff for over 5 minutes although they were not busy .We then ordered some food and they got the order totally wrong...... my dish arrived but there was no sign at all of my friend's food or her daughter's food, which arrived 25 minutes later. The staff we spoke to were rude or completely ignored us and, believe me, this was not a cheap meal. The food itself was cold, tasteless and we hardly ate any of it. I would not waste any money on eating here and the staff need a lesson in customer service and manners in general........ never again! 
-4; Promised so much and delivered so little! A real disappointment and although Tripadvisor is a great web site - and I laways check the site for somewhere that I am considering staying in (being very fussy) and accompanying hotel web site. On this occasion I did just that and although there were a number of posters on here praising the pub abd accomodation to the full there were a few pretty poor ones too that I should have taken much more cognisance of. The owner must be using his netrwork of cousins, nephews and nieces to the full!  On arrival the place looked dirty and neglected (my first thought was to bail out and go somewhere else) but once shown to my room I thought that I would just stick with it as it was only for the one night.  I then started to think that the owners had done not too bad a job with getting people to praise them up on Tripadvisor as some owners do which started to annoy me.  For me the place was dirty, food poor and the owners scrimping for pennies which was exemplified by them switching off the central heating during the night when it was absolutely bitter cold!! No shower in the room either and a dirty carpet in the room and in the pub itself. I wouldn't even eat in this place in the future never mind stay overnight.  If I could give this establishment a 1 out of 5 then I would! 
-4; Booked as a last minute for the rugby weekend, on arrival it looked great and you can see that the hotel has undergone some refurbishment however after check in we were disgusted. After being given a key to a 500 number room, followed the signs past the kitchen, toilets and into a dirty corridor. Wet floor signs on the floor where they had put cement down to put new tiles in...why you would do this around 3pm when check in is I have no idea. We had 2 rooms between us, my parents were in the room opposite and had the delight of a heater and a fan, room smelt damp and was very cold so left the heater on whilst out. Window looks into a wall and was just generally old and very tatty not what you would expect from the outside. Our room however was even worse, stains all around the bath, the toilet had actual excrement still in the toilet, mould growing on the mirror, room was freezing cold, window backed into an alley which the staff use constantly and had to keep the curtains closed to stop people looking in, bedside lamp was broken and hanging off the wall, limited to one pillow and one towel. Possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Breakfast the next morning was an experience as room absolutely stunk of curry due to a wedding the night before I believe, there was only two breakfast staff which given their due were constantly running back and forth from the kitchen but the food was just not being produced enough for the level of customers that were eating. If you check in and are given a room that is one of the 500's honestly just check out and find another hotel near by as it was vile and the only reason we stayed is everywhere else we tried was fully booked 
-4; I came here for a spa break to celebrate my birthday with my friends. To start off with there was no towels in our room and the mirror and shower had not been cleaned. We went to receive our treatments which we had booked, and was told we were not on their booking form and therefore we couldn't receive our treatments. The manager promised us a full refund of the spa break, however this manager is no longer there. The current manager now who I tried to liaise with did not reply to my emails, and whenever I tried to contact the spa no one answered their phones. To me this is terrible customer service, a company should not promise something and not give it, and customers should always be responded to! It has gone on months to get to a resolution, which I am still not happy with and they didn't even discuss with me. Will not be visiting again, as this was a birthday spa break that wasn't relaxing and has hassled me for months!! 
-4;" We chose this hotel because it allowed dogs and so our initial reaction was to forgive the owners our first impression of old chip fat smell and grubby carpets. However.......the bedside lights didn't work; our shower was cold both in the evening and morning; the hair drier was lifeless and to cap it all, our room was directly above a bar which emitted dance music most of the night. Our dog growled at the throbbing base! Our bed had threadbare sheets and the mattress was soggy and lumpy. Breakfast consisted of tepid weak coffee, tinned peaches and presumably something cooked in the ancient fat.  We left a msg with the breakfast staff, asking the manager to ring us in the hope that these issues could be resolved. He never did. We didn't stay the second night as planned, but as far as we know, still had to pay for it. We preferred the sofa offered to us by a friend. "
-4;"I have stayed here on numerous occasions and always been very impressed with the site and the caravan . My family are close by and it's a nice base for day trips for the whole family. However just spent four nights in 35 The Pastures a newer model deluxe caravan!!!!! Well I didn't stay as the cleanliness of the van left a lot to be desired. Firstly there was a large rip in the Lino which I reported to the reception and was told it was a common problem in &quot;that type of caravan &quot; The boiler cupboard door did not shut again I was told this was an issue with this caravan. No net curtains at the window so no privacy .  The sofa bed in the lounge area was heavily stained, and when the cushions were removed there was a large amount of food under the cushions,not just crumbs but lumps of butter and whole biscuits!!!!!!!!  The windows were dirty and outside the door was around 30 cigarette butts and dirty tissues.  I rang reception and I was told someone would come and have a look, after waiting 2 hours I left to stay with family and certainly will not be back.  Don't be fooled when they say they would rather you complain while you are still there so they can do something to help, this was proved to be untrue."
-4; Travelled to London for a Christmas night out. Had been emailed in the day to say due to maintenance we had been 'upgraded' to another hotel. We arrived at the other hotel which was nowhere near where we wanted to be to be shown a cupboard in the basement which was apparently our bedroom. After a phone call and speaking to reception we were 'upgraded' again to a cupboard on the 2nd floor which was classed as a club room. We were due at a function so took the room which had the window open this should have set off alarm bells, before we left we closed the window. We had to get a cab due to the distance we now were from the restaurant, the cab arrange by the hotel drove in circles so cost nearly twice as much as on the way back. We arrived back at the hotel about midnight to the smell in our room of sewers. A member of staff came to the room and brought an air fresher as a solution to the problem, not an acceptable one. We ended up getting a cab home. I would never book this hotel and would ensure no-one I know booked with them either. I wish I had read the comments on here first and will check this site in future. My next phone call will be to environmental health. 
-4; The website for this spa break is completely misleading. It is not a spa - it is a pool which was filled with children and locals. There were at least 40 people in the pool which I believe would be against health and safety as there was no life guard for the children. Furthermore the pool has no seating area so is not really a spa area at all - it is just a pool with lots of people in it.  The atmosphere was very unpleasant and the steam room and spa were so small that when we had to take it in turns to use them. Also we were squashed up to eachother and strangers all touching flesh - disgusting. Worst of all was the attitude of the staff when we asked them if we could have some seats to relax around the pool, they obviously had no idea what a spa entails.  The rooms were very spacious and clean but there was no shampoo, soap or condition in the bathroom it felt as if they were trying to skimp on everything.   The restaurant was the one gem, the food was delicious and the service was good in the restaurant even though it was appalling around the spa area so I will rate it terrible overall as our reason for being there was for a spa break.  I would not recommend this hotel as a spa break. 
-4; We called here for lunch today and ordered 2 sandwiches which sounded good on the menu. When they arrived we were shocked to see they were made with limp sliced bread. There was a hardly any filling and the salad which accompanied them was way past its best (slimey). I complained and was given a refund but come on, why are you using sliced bread when there are so many artisan bakeries in this area. There are many eating places in Cirencester all of which serve better sandwiches. We shall not return 
-4; It was unfortunate that travelling to Stansted for the first time arriving from Egypt late in the evening I booked myself into this hotel.  The lady booking me in was lovely but it was all downhill from that point. The room itself looked clean and tidy but the noise from the air conditioning/heat unit was unbearable all night. I couldn't quit make up my mind what this unit was as it blew neither hot nor cold air!!!  I ordered a diet coke from room service, this arrived as a small bottle with a top which requires a bottle opener, no ice and employee left. I had to call room service again ask for ice and an opener not a good start at all.  The smell of diesel coming through said unit was terrible (this was the next morning).  Now to breakfast, it was a disgrace, lukewarm black pudding (don't know who your supplier is but you seriously need to change) the same with black pudding, not once was there a chef on hand to check temperatures of food!! Plates stone cold. Thought I'll have an orange juice, first glass was dirty with the remains of what looked like yoghourt, this had been placed on a tray by a member of the kitchen staff , who obviously doesn't check as the second glass was even worse. I'll have tea went, went to the table and removed the napkin and guess what, it had been put down on a dirty table and was covered in butter.   At £85 per night this hotel is a disgrace. I've been once and wont be back.  I might add that the walk from the airport to the hotel was quite intimidating for a woman on her own as it was very badly lit. 
-4;Our initial experience of check-in was terrible. It took over half an hour. The receptionist kept running off saying she had to see her manager but would not tell us what the issue was. She then said that the hotel was full which we knew as we were at a conference and had booked a standard sea-view room in April 2013 for our stay in April 2014. She then stood by her computer doing nothing but staring at us. I asked if she did not have our booking but she said she did. She then suggested that we went and sat in the lounge for a while with no explanation as to why. This we refused to do as we thought we would never check in. She then stopped serving us but was the same with the people behind us who did go and sit in the lounge but returned about 20 minutes later wondering what was going on. It eventually transpired that she had no standard rooms, let alone one with a sea-view so we were offered a cheaper room - a sub-standard one presumably. She then demanded that we pay the full amount although we had paid a non-refundable deposit of £50 in April 2013 as this was a condition of them taking a booking for the conference. She denied that she had received this but could not explain why she had a record of my American Express card on the booking form. She asked if I had my credit card statement with me. For some reason, I didn't.  Eventually we were given keys to our room which turned out to be minute and difficult for two people to move around in. Our windows looked straight out on to the car park. We had to keep the blinds down in the bathroom and in the bedroom when changing as the windows looked out on the car park and were not frosted so anyone outside could look straight in. To be fair to the hotel, they put a bottle of wine in our room as they had mucked us about on rooms. However, this did not really compensate for the fact that we did not have the pleasant experience planned.  The next bad experience was on the second day, returning to our room at 4 pm, we found that it had not been cleaned. We rang reception who sent a maid who stood in the doorway and said that she did not do cleaning after 3 pm. The lack of cleaning was, according to her, our fault because we had left a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. We said no, we had left a Please Service This Room sign up and had indeed just taken it in on our return. She argued about this and said all she could do was give us clean towels. I said that this was not acceptable and I wanted to see the manager. Maid and a manager returned the latter also saying that the lack of cleaning was our fault as we had put a Do Not Disturb sign out. We said that this was not true and we were very unimpressed at staff arguing with us. We then left (you couldn't get 3 or 4 people into the room) so that they could clean the room which they duly did. We thought that their attitude was pretty poor though.  Friends of ours had a knock on their door at 10 on Sunday morning to find a maid telling them that check was at 10 and they should have left the room. Any hotel that wants its guests out by 10 on a Sunday is not a place worth staying in.  We didn't use the leisure facilities as thought it terrible that hotel guests have to pay £4 each time. We also heard that you have to pay £1 for a towel and a non-refundable £1 for a locker.  In the room, the towels are small and not remotely fluffy. Breakfast was very average.  I would not stay here again. Staff have forgotten who they are supposed to be providing service to. We had friends in the Premier Inn over the road who were very happy with their experience. They had a big room with a sea view and pleasant staff all for £50.
-4;" My mother kindly bought us this 'luxury' weekend as a break away from everything since she is going through chemo at the moment; the holiday also co-coincided with my fiance and I just getting engaged so we were looking forward to a weekend of relaxing and celebrating....   Within 5 minutes of arriving we were at reception complaining because our room was filthy! A stale drain smell in the grubby bathroom, hairs on the sheets, sticky furniture. Reception offered us an upgrade but we would have to pay £40 per night! We get to the next room which was a twin bed, had used tea spoons in it, stained sheets. So back down to reception and we speak to the manager (a guy called Simon, very pleasant and understanding, only been there a few weeks himself). He gave us another room upgrade and personally checked it - much better! However, after returning from an unpleasant swim in the pool (see below), we found ourselves locked out of our room for 40 minutes while they tried to change and recharge the batteries; once in the room we then couldn't leave for another hour as the door had to be recalibrated, and just our luck, the machine to do this also needed charging!!  The hotel on a whole is absolutely filthy: from the carpets in the hallways that don't look like they've seen a hoover in months and have been repaired by gaffa tape; to the run-down pool facilities with murky water, dirty floors (there was a used plaster on the stairs to the changing rooms!) a ceiling that looks like it is about to collapse and a general lack of cleanliness.   The only 2 positive things from the whole weekend were firstly the beautiful golf course and the staff in the golf shop were lovely. Secondly we had a very pleasant evening meal (our waitress was wonderful, Stacey, even bought us free prosecco because of our engagement!). The food was nice, nothing outstanding. Breakfast was very below par, and the carvery was a rip off, £6 for a starter you have to serve yourself and consists of luncheon meat!!!   The building itself, from the outside, is stunning. It is such a shame that almost everything else lets the hotel down. It needs a lot of TLC and I truly hope this happens. We certainly would not recommend this hotel to anyone and wish we had read the reviews before we went and got my mother her money back. "
-4; I booked into the hotel yesterday and all was fine. The hotel is well located and close to the city centre.  Unfortunately, I was treated with disrespect and rudeness from the night staff when I enquired about breakfast times and check out. I had been out for a few drinks (not drunk) but did not expect to be patronised and belittled by staff at a hotel I am paying for. There are much better hotels for considerably less money within the local vicinity and I would not recommend this hotel. 
-4;"I visited this venue today hoping for a relaxing spa day with my friend. On arrival we were disappointed at the price of parking, and being told to sit down and wait to be seen. we found a seat and one of the spa staff brought us a robe each and showed us to the changing rooms. we used the steam room (which smelt awful - in other spas we have visited essential oils have made steam rooms much nicer) and the sanarium and sauna which were lovely. there is a &quot;fun shower&quot; essentially a cold shower with multicoloured lights but only one bulb was working, and a plunge pool. The Jacuzzi was lovely. The treatment rooms were shabby, one had a ceiling panel missing and grease marks all over the walls and the other was freezing cold. in the entire spa there are only 4 day beds - my friend and I sat on dining chairs until 3pm when people started leaving and we finally could put our feet up - until 3.30 when to our shock two families turned up, one child having a swimming lesson and another in the jacuzzi. We both have children and this is the precise reason we book spa days - to have a break! it was also off putting that anyone can enter the spa to sit in the seating area overlooking the river, in the same room as all of the spa guests in their swimwear. We asked staff how we could make a complaint and the 2 staff members argued infront of us over who had to deal with the complaint (the hotel staff or the spa staff) this was very unprofessional. Our lunch was a sandwich and half a packet of crisps which came to £6.50 each and we were not offered a drink at any point in the day other than to be shown where the water cooler was. At the end of the day we saw other guests in the changing rooms with towels and asked if they had been told to bring their own as we had not and they said no they had asked for them at reception. At this point everyone in the changing room was grumbling at the lack of day beds and not being given a towel at check in, myself and my friend had been using our towelling robes to dry ourselves - hardly comfortable to then sit in. very disappointed and we will not be returning."
-4; As they said to us 'this is a function hotel' which means if we have one on, everything else doesn't matter. We had dinner booked in at 7:45 as they couldn't take use any earlier. We had starters but had to wait 80 minutes plus for mains. We were one of 4 other tables waiting for food. No food was coming out of the kitchen to the restaurant for 45 minutes so I only guest they were serving the function at 9pm. Our food arrived at 9:10, we were just hungry, so eat and bed. Got into bed 9:55pm just about fell asleep then our room turned into a loud disco, 10pm, no opportunity to sleep peacefully tonight. Went to reception to be told they are a function hotel so deal with it. We were moved rooms to the quiet side and slept soundly.   In the morning we had a late breakfast, luckily we are vegetarians as no meat left on the buffet, no yoghurt, pastries no mushrooms, so so disappointing. 
-4;I cant find an email address anywhere for the hotel to report this. I have checked out today after a disappointing stay. The TV didn't work, the picture was fuzzy on each and every channel and only had about 5 channels. I ordered room service and the sandwhich was inedible and my order was wrong. I tried calling reception to report this but no answer. I also tried to report this on check out but I was waiting so long for a member of staff to acknowledge me that I needed to leave for my train. Upon check in, nothing was explained. Although another guest checking in at the same time had a full run down of all the facilities and open times. The noise was nearly unbearable. The walls are paper thin and you can hear every single thing coming from the rooms around.
-4;" I booked this hotel last Friday -17th July 2015 and received confirmation in form of an e mail immediately. Everything went through perfectly. However, I received an e mail today - 22nd July, asking me to contact Holiday Inn Kensington Inn as a matter of urgency. I phoned them and have just been told that a mistake had been made and the price I was charged was too low! They cancelled my room because I said it was bad practice and the girl said she would re book it for me at &quot;todays price&quot; which was much higher. I am shocked and disgusted as I have used this hotel on a regular basis as its a very handy base for business. They have effectively blackmailed me into paying a higher price. "
-4; We recently stayed at the Marriott Courtyard Hotel at Gatwick airport for two nights – both booked via ‘Holiday Extras’:  Having driven from Cheshire to Gatwick we expected to stay in a good hotel which would include on-site car parking for that night. On checking in we discovered that we were expected to pay an additional £18 for parking on site that night! As we had bags that we needed to use that night but then wanted to leave in the boot of our car for the duration of our holiday we had no option but to pay this but do feel aggrieved at this charge especially as we were, in fact entitled to up to 15 days car parking but only used 12.  We had our return night also booked at the hotel – which DID include on-site parking for that night??? On our return to Gatwick, we checked into the hotel but had to change rooms after several hours as the heating was not working in our room. 
-4; Stayed here recenctly and I have to say it was shocking!!! Xmas party going on and really all focus was on this no consideration for normal paying guests. staff were running around and clearly no organisation. The room was dated and not very clean how it passes a four star rating is beyond me. Check-in was nightmare and very impolite young lady when asking about meals etc she was like'' Well we do have xmas party going on so kitchen is really busy!!!! It was like we were an inconvience.... Never reconmend this Hotel to anyone Avoid at all cost!!!! 
-4; Food poor even took our money on the second night then informed us we couldn't have our meal had to use the restaurant only for same meal but ten pounds dearer. Which we had dined in the night before only to be served Luke warm soup and six carrot sticks and eight green beans with over cooked salmon .front door constantly banging causing whole room to shake so don't accept room ten. Beds ok if under five feet six! Not value for money tried to complain but no one there to deal with it only a sheet of paper only compliment goes to the village shop. 
-4;My mother and I have just returned from a 'luxury' spa break at the Grand Harbour Hotel. Room was great and the food at the No. 5 restaurant (both dinner and breakfast) was faultless. However, the spa (the main reason for which we had booked the break) left a lot to be desired. Only staying one night at the hotel we were hoping to make the most of the spa facilities, however, on our arrival at the spa we found that both the steam room and the jacuzzi were out of order. Considering that these are vital components of a 'luxury spa break' (and half the facilities on offer in the pool area) and the fact that I had paid what I considered to be not an insignificant amount of money to treat my mother, I complained to the staff on duty. None of the staff seemed to be bothered with my concerns and only assured me that the steam room would be fixed by thursday (little use to us as we were leaving on the tuesday). I have since written a letter of complaint to the spa manager and have had no response. Poor spa experience and poor staff service.
-4;" Been for a xmas evening and the wait between courses was lengthy to say the least. The disco was mediocre you couldn't understand a word the young dj had to say. Having paid good money for this evening of entertainment and expected the bar to serve until 12.30 it closed at 11.30 and the disco was billed until 1am actually shut down very abruptly at 11.50pm! When on the way out to collect our coats from the cloakroom, which we were forced to pay £1 forward &quot;charity&quot; there was no-one there and our coats on display for anyone to help themselves! I am disgusted with the running of this hotel and urge others to think twice before spending time and money there! "
-4; I recently stayed at the Roslin Beach hotel to attend one of my best friends wedding. I was highly impressed with the venue, food and overall attentiveness of the staff. We were fully catered for throughout the 2 days I was there, and they could not do enough to ensure that everything ran smoothly. I am quite fussy when it comes to hotel rooms but found mine to be spacious, beautifully set out and comfortable. It was a beautiful day that everyone enjoyed and I hope to be returning here with my family in the future! 
-4; I booked two executive rooms as part of a Christmas present for my parents so me and my dad could attend a football match and we could all go to the Coronation Street Tour. The rooms were nice but that's where any positivity ends! At about 6.00pm I asked to book a table for 9.00pm in the restaurant, I was told there was nothing at 9.00pm but 9.30 was possible. I said yes that's fine. While I was getting the room number a manager was speaking to the bloke taking the booking and by the time I got back I was being asked do you not want to eat now! Erm no I want to eat later.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing and what happened later indicated that clearly they wanted us to eat earlier so they could close up. We went for our meal at 9.30, and were asked what drinks we wanted, we said a bottle of wine and some water, 40 minutes later, still having no food order taken the waiter returned said there was no pino grigiot and plonked a bottle of water on the table!  So we had sat waiting for 40 minutes without any drinks and with no food order taken for the privilege of receiving a bottle of water. Common sense should suggest come back and ask if we want different wine and take a food order, it's a restaurant!  I'm not one to whinge about hotels or service but this was a disgrace and completely put a downer on what was intended to be a lovely family weekend away! 
-4; We bought a night in this hotel as it was the cheapest 4* hotel in this area. When we got there the price just kept adding on. Parking was £12.50 on top for one night! They offered a room upgrade, the colleague explained it would be £20 for breakfast, normally £15 each, and some other stuff which we wouldn’t have benefited from as we were going to an event at Wembley Arena. The next morning when we came down for breakfast, there was nothing but some cereal boxes, croissants and coffee. When I asked is this was all there is, they said yes. I cant believe you would charge £15 each for a coffee and a croissant! The colleague said that not just what the £20 included, you get wifi in your room, I said no you have to pay extra for wifi because I asked when we checked in. She said yes but you get wifi in your room, i said wifi you cant use? She said yes! Everything just seem to be added to the bill with no explanation and an awful service!  I would not recommend this hotel or the Crowne Plaza chain! 
-4; Went here for cocktails before dinner which we had (happily) booked elsewhere in wimbledon village. A member of staff showed us to an outside table at our request and we sat enjoying the view of the park. We had to ask someone if we could order our drinks and someone finally came over. Other people's drinks arrived (presumably because they had ordered wine not cocktails) but we waited about 20 minutes before ours arrived, and that was only after we had asked someone what had happened. We asked if we could have some olives and snacks which we had seen on other tables and the pleasant waiter said yes he would go and get those. But after another long wait these hadn't arrived and we had to ask again. They were delivered in a very surly manner - no eye contact, let alone an apology! What a shame - the cocktails, snacks, view, were all lovely but the edge was taken off the evening by this extremely poor service. 
-4; I asked for a quiet twin bedded room. It was shocking. There was a stag party going on in the function room and I may as well have been at it. V loud. The twin beds were at opposite ends of a long narrow room. One bed had no bedside table or lamp. There were 2 wicker chairs to sit on - v uncomfortable. The bathroom was shocking, a dirty blind, net curtain that didn't fit, noisy fan, single glazed, no hot water in the evening. I was moved the next day to another room but there was a wedding function until midnight. V v. V noisy. 
-4; We recently had a two night stay at this hotel and I can honestly say we were stunned at the state of the room we were given. It was on the first floor and when we walked in we thought it was a joke. It was the worst hotel room we had ever seen. The furniture was what you would expect to see in a junk shop and the beds and general decor was appaling. The bathroom was so basic and old fashioned I am amazed this can be classed as 5 star. The beds and bedding were so old and uncomfortable and the cot we paid for was a stained travel cot without a mattress, The room was £156 per night which was daylight robbery, Wish we had read the reviews before booking and had we not paid £100 deposit on booking we would not even have spent a night in this dreadful place. 
-4;We stayed at this hotel before and found the location to be excellent and the room was nice if rather small. I booked it again but somehow messed up the booking, I think trying to find my membership number, and arrived to find we had a single room. I went back to reception and explained what had happened and she told me they had no double rooms. She went and checked with the bookings manager and came back and told me they could not help me. There was no attempt to find any solution so we booked another hotel and gave back the keys. She looked surprised and asked why I was leaving. I keep getting emails asking how I enjoyed my stay. I said I did not stay but still no response. We ended up in the Queensberry, much nicer to be honest.
-4; beware if doing early check in the will charge you £10 and they wont let you leave bags there so you have to check in. make sure in your room the shower has a curtain as ours didn't and flooded the whole bathroom also water was freezing cold and they only gave us one towel. was a good location, but quite hard to find as loads of building work nearby. alright just as a bed fro the night but could pay a little extra and get something half decent. if you do have a problem good luck actually being able to speak to anyone as there is constantly as massive que at reception and the staff don't really seem to understand or care what you mean. aright if you want somewhere for just a bed, but that's about it. having a shower is a nightmare in the morning, sooo cold. and try and make much money as they can out of you with that early check in, but its not like you have a choice! will not be going back, in my opinion Travelodge are the worst budget hotels by far        
-4; Was really looking forward to our break, Been a stressful year so was looking forward to relaxing spa break, However the hotel was filled with young children, not all well behaved. Some screaming and shouting in the restaurant. The pool in the spa was filled with children, some with flippers and snorkels, so was not relaxing at all. The jacuzzi had a sign that clearly stated you needed to be over 16 but had children in it messing around. No adults from hotel or spa supervising area to monitor this! Outside pool was filled with leaves and obviously hadn't been cleaned for days. Some of the jets in the monsoon shower were not working.  Continental breakfast was poor! No meats or cheeses just a few croissants, cereals, and yogurts. There was a bowl of fresh fruit salad but no individual fruit. Our upgraded (?) room overlooked the rubbish area. We were woken at 6.30am when staff started throwing bottles into the rubbish bin and then general banging around for about an hour at which point we were fully awake.  The room was very dark and we had to have lights on all the time. It was also a long way from reception with lots of steep steps and no lift. We were exhausted just from the walk to the room. I was really excited about this break, it wasn't cheap and I have never been so disappointed with a break away.  When we mentioned this on checking out the receptionist said we could speak to the duty manager but we just wanted to leave. Our fault by not raising it there and then but I was so upset I didn't want to speak to anyone at the time. 
-4;Stayed in a double room on 5th floor. The room was filthy with the bottom of the curtains black from dirt. Large stains on the carpet, air con didn't work and was held onto the ceiling with sellotape, square sink in round hole, broken bed, wardrobe with sliding doors and no runners etc etc. Have emailed to register concerns - especially the blocked shower head which is a prime cause of Legionella but had no response.
-4; I book Premier Inn hotels as they have a reputation for having high standards for a budget price hotel. Not so this hotel in Bristol. Badly in need of refurbishment and decorating as it is shabby with worn carpets and dirty paintwork. The worst thing was the unpleasant smell inside the corridors and the room itself.  In addition breakfast was served in the adjoining pub which had been very busy the evening before. Trying to eat breakfast with the smell of alcohol is not a good combination, the carpets in the breakfast area were frankly a trip hazard as so worn and falling to pieces.  The Premier Inn staff were helpful but this was not consistent with some staff giving barely enough information on the hotel facilities and the room. No information in the room either on how to operate the air conditioning etc. I certainly would not recommend this hotel at £85 per night there will be much better hotels to book. I would also now be hesitant in booking a Premier Inn again 
-4; I have nothing good to say about his hotel I was in room G4 and you could hear everything next door from texts going off to then plugging things in. The walls were so thin. The beds were a springy uncomfortable mess and even using both pillows was not enough comfort due to lumps.  I would never stay here again 
-4; Stayed for 3 nights and booked 2 rooms and first poor impressions began before our stay. I tried to book some relaxing treatments over a period of 10 days and no-one got back to me! From the outside to the interior there was filth and rubbish. Carpets were worn and dirty as were the walls and furnishings. The bar area had so much dirt on it's floor, I really didn't want to have a drink. The suite (Room at The Top), was 'superior' which was a joke as we had a constant loud ventilation noise from the outside extractors. We had an electric heater to warm the room and TV's that didn't give us the free movies that is advertised for this upgrade. The newspapers promised also never arrived. Our key to the room had to be changed every day in order to get in. Breakfast at £17 a head was so inedible on the first morning, (our eggs raw) that we never ate in the hotel again! There was no/very little customer service as the staff avoided eye contact and clearly were so used to complaints that they had found a way of providing robotic responses. A local employee informed us that the hotel mainly survives on contract bookings from tradesmen. I can suspect that after a long day's physical work, the much looked forward to pint would be far too expensive to enjoy! This hotel was so awful and therefore an expensive experience on many levels that we will never use a Mercure again (we stay in hotels several times a year). It was Fawlty Towers without the humour. Not a 4 star or, 3 star by any means! . 
-4;Having booked a room at this hotel through Lastminute.com, I rang the hotel to confirm that they were expecting us. I spoke to a very abrupt woman who simply told me that the booking was cancelled without further explanation. Having requested an explanation, I managed to drag out of her that the booking was cancelled by Lastminute.com and that they had no rooms available. Whilst it appears that the cancellation was not their fault, it is often how a company details with problems that lets you know if they are any good or not and in this case the Cambridge Belfry was poor to say the least.
-4; I recently visited the Lakeside hotel with my family whilst staying in a nearby cottage. My intention was to take my parents there for my mothers 70th birthday meal but when we tried to book a table, we were told we couldn't have one unless we were staying at the hotel. I couldn't really understand this as the hotel restaurants are not usually for exclusive use of guests. We made other arrangements and went there for a drink instead. We thought there had been a mistake when we were charged nearly £30.00 for one pint and three small glasses of wine but when I checked the price list, I realised the price was correct. The price for a glass of wine was anything 'from' £7.00 and it didn't even come in a clean glass! I have since contacted the hotel twice to ask for an explanation as to why we were refused a table but it has been nearly a month now and I am still waiting for a reply. I can only assume that the hotel management must think that extortionate prices and a very snobby attitude mean they are above responding to complaints. Needless to say, I won't be returning and wouldn't recommend it. 
-4; Checked in to a small attic room too hot and grubby we complained we were moved to another room! the sheets were too small for the small double bed, still dark, dismal and too hot for £315 per night we went and complained and we were told the hotel was full for royal ascot and they were due for refurbishment! As we booked 9 months ago this was unsatisfactory we checked out! 
-4; Despite calling to discuss our July booking and putting a deposit down in February, we were called in June to say that the room had been double booked because the hotel had taken down our dates wrong. They had failed to send us a confirmation of the booking we made because they had taken down our address wrong so we had no opportunity to check it, we just assumed that having discussed it on the phone everything would be fine. This totally messed up our summer holiday. What annoyed us the most was that the room was clearly available when we made the booking and put down a deposit yet they refused to cancel the booking that was made after ours. Horrible and unprofessional service. Useless booking staff, can't be trusted. 
-4;" Spa is very small. The so called &quot;sensational shower experience&quot; was hot and cold showers that were both cold. The outside hot tub was covered in leaves from the surrounding trees and the water had a dirty smell. The light in the steam room did not work and the handle was missing off the inside of the sauna room door making it difficult to close. The foot spa water was cold. The showers in both the mens and ladies changing rooms were cold so you could not get a hot shower to clean yourself after the sauna and steam room. There is only room for 1 man in the mens changing room with 1 shower, the ladies also has only 1 shower and 2 changing cubicles. Couldn't wait to get home to get a hot shower. Would not recommend the spa to anyone, such a bad experience. "
-4; We have just checked out , We had our car parked with the hotel for a week while we went on honeymoon. And checked in at 3:20am this morning after a late flight. We thought if we slept for a few hours when we land it would make the 2 hour journey from the airport a little better.  However we were very disappointed with our stay, and surprised at this as we have stayed with the hotel as it's former self the Bewleys.  We left the car a week ago and was told it would be just outside the hotel on our return so we could put our large luggage in before checking in. This was not the case. The car was parked at least a 7 min walk from the hotel and not where we were instructed. And at early hours of the morning searching in the dark for your car was not fun. When we checked in I asked if there was any food still available and I was told no. But discovering the room service menu this morning it was clear to see sandwiches were available until 4am . When entering the room it was unbelievably hot. And we had just arrived back from a tropical destination and it wasn't as hot over there. They said they couldn't help about the room  But sent up a fan. All it did was push hot air around the room. ( the heating was on, why in July I have no idea)  The noise was horrendous and neither of is have slept much. So it was a waste of money really.  When we originally left the car a week ago the receptionist had taken the ticket from me, that I received from the entry barrier. And she said I didn't need it. Only to find when we tried to drive out we were trapped. So had to turn around and back into the hotel to gain another ,  Poor service and disappointed about our stay. We will not be returning . When checking out they didn't even bother to ask how my stay was :-( 
-4; Check in is now so impersonal with the electronic machines, we were not seen by any staff or told about any information regarding our stay. Our spa treatments were quite poor. The restaurant closes at 5 of a Sunday for which we were not informed so we had to dine in the pub were every available table was dirty. You are allocated £30 to spend with your spa package, the only starter which allows you to stay in this budget was conveniently sold out and on check out we were overcharged for this food. Will never return all staff seemed disinterested, I have emailed a complaint and this has been ignored. 
-4; We stayed here on 18th May for 3 nights. Having stayed here before we knew the score and that at weekends in particular the so called executive suite was sold off at very low prices. This meant that there was a scrum for the free drinks, so much so that the bottles of spirits are hidden away on Friday & Saturday nights and available to help yourself the rest of the week. It was the same this time - some really rough people, fat orange fake tanned legs, swearing etc etc..  to make matters worse our room was of poor quality, the mattress had no support whatsoever, the noise levels from the corridor and above and next door were high. Just not what you would expect of Hilton. On the Sunday the Great Manchester run was taking place and there was a reception in Cloud23, which adoins the exec lounge. We witnessed the food arriving before it was taken through to the reception. One large trolley, with no shelving and all of the platters of food perched precariously on top of each other was wheeled in. the waiter took the plates of food out one by one and placed them on the FLOOR before he picked them up again and took them to the reception. The cross contamination of differing foods as they were touching and then placing them on the floor was disgusting to see. Oh, and we went up to Cloud 23 one evening for drinks before we went out to dinner. Great views but dont look at the carpet or the furniture as it is full of dirty marks, tears and holes...it was filthy and in need of an urgent revamp. I think we will stay at The Lowry or Radission next time! On check out we did leave a comments card and was advised that the Manager would contact us - he never has... 
-4; Well where shall I start booked this thinking plenty to do What a mistake spent most of our time of site in Skegness If you like queuing and crowds this is the place for you  Didn't see any shows wasn't prepared to spend the afternoon in a queue  Children running around people must of lost their children constantly  Staff not friendly at all Looked down at you Wouldn't be recommended this to anyone   
-4; It is with deep regret that I have to write a disappointing review, my husband and I went for a meal in the newly opened Potting Shed restaurant last night, I had the chicken and leek pie, it was presented well and seemed ok but soon realised that it had been very much over peppered and my throat began to sting really badly, I mentioned it to the waiter who promptly said he would take my drink off the bill and that no one else had complained and that they had sold loads, my husband tried a little of it and when he got home was sick, I am going to write a letter to the hotel Manager as I do not feel we had very good service at all, I am sorry to have to write a review like this as we were so very much looking forward to eating there as we had had a wonderful cream tea in the main hotel only weeks beforehand. My throat is still very sore this morning and has lumps on the back like blisters :( 
-4; I booked a room at the Sheffield Hilton on 10th Nov for a one night stay on 23rd Nov, payment in full taken at time of booking when I called the Hilton booking line service (not a third party booking agent, direct with hotel). On the day of my stay I was called at about 6pm by the hotel manager to tell me that the hotel had been overbooked and my booking had been swapped to the Jury's Inn. I was not 'asked', I was 'told', and told that there was no alternative.  I was not happy about being moved but the manager explained it was common procedure for the hotel to overbook and for people to get moved in this manner. There seemed to be little in the way of an apology, and I was again told there was absolutely no way a room could be made available to me at the Hilton.  I find this absolutely unacceptable. How can a hotel take your money in the knowledge that you may not actually receive the bedroom you booked??   I especially wanted to make use of the swimming pool facility before meeting friends the following morning, the Jury's Inn had no pool facility and I was told I could make my way to the Hilton to use the facilities - a prospect which was unlikely to be convenient for me (the hotels are not next to each other), and therefore I missed out on my swim.  The manager tried to sell the move to me by saying that at the Hilton I was booked on B&B board, and at the Jury's Inn I would get breakfast - but I already had plans to meet my friends for breakfast so this was of no use to me.  The manager also told me the Jury's Inn room was more expensive than the offer I had booked for the Hilton, however if I had booked the Jury's Inn in advance as I had done with the Hilton, the room would have in fact been cheaper. I checked.  After assuring me no financial compensation could be made I swiftly passed the phone to my husband and lo-and-behold a few strong words resulted in a 50% refund (still not yet appearing in my bank account however).   So not only are the Hilton putting the importance of selling out all their rooms ahead of acceptable customer service, they are not forthcoming in offering suitable compensation and expect a customer to be 'grateful' for them breaking their contract.  I'm disgusted in the way we were treated and will not be booking with Hilton in the future. 
-4; This resort is filthy, extremely expensive and dirty, the staff were rude and obnoxious at times the only saving grace was the WWE experience! Hopefully WWE will move their tour away from this hovel! Beautiful surroundings but filthy dated accommodation. Cost almost £500 for a family of 3 for 3 nights in standard room........don't do it!!!! U need to book at least a gold room and just had that priced for WWE next year at £927 for the three of us!  STAY AWAY!!! 
-4; We booked a 1 night stay through GB Tours, which included breakfast and dinner. On arrival the staff were pleasant and prompt in allocating us our room and the rooms were clean, yet unbearably hot! We opened both windows and plugged in the fan, however this was not ideal when we we're leaving for dinner as the windows were not security protected.  When checking out of the hotel I regrettably left behind my jacket I was wearing when I checked in, but did not realize till the following morning. Urgently I called the hotel and left a message with the receptionist quoting my room number, times and dates I was at the hotel and where I left my jacket for her to pass on to house-keeping. Unfortunately to my surprise, and frustration, my jacket was not found. I had to call the hotel on several occasions for information after empty promises of a call-back, to which I was transferred more than once to housekeeping where the line went dead. Whilst on the phone to the head receptionist I stressed my concern as I had photo-graphic evidence taken the night of my stay which clearly shown my jacket lay on the chair! This was ignored and I was very quickly asked whether I held insurance! I most certainly will NOT be staying in this hotel ever again, and neither will either of the 5 colleagues I was away with as they too, are disgusted in the manner my concern was dealt with! 
-4; This hotel is overpriced for the experience. Waited 1 hour for breakfast to arrive. No-one to assist with getting to room. Hotel is in poor condition. Breakfast staff rushing around but no breakfast appears. There are additional costs at every turn - Breakfast is £17.50 but you must pay extra for fish. Credit cards have a £3 charge. Parking is £5. Nothing about staying here feels relaxing when you feel robbed at every turn. Mini Bar was completely empty so if you wanted a drink you couldn't easily get one. Wardrobe felt damp. All in all a washout at a very high price. Staff on desk were great and although we did not complain about the breakfast we were given £20 off our bill from the receptionist/restaurant manage. 
-4;My colleges amd I had our Christmas party at this Hotel on 03/12/11. We have been to parties before at this hotel and always had a good time. I don't know if they have a new party manager, but this time it was dreadful. We were inb the Kent Suite and there was not one Christmas decoration in the room where we were to eat, not even a Christmas Tree. The food was absolutel awful. I had a mozzarella stack to start, which consisted of two wafer thin slices of tomatoand two thin slices of mozzarella plonked in the middle of the plate with no garnish. For my main meal I had salmon which was a very small fillet, two sprouts the size of peas, half a dozen inch long pieces of carrot and two boiled potatoes. Some of my colleges had ordered turkey for the main and they got theirs 20 minutes after I had mine so we could not eat all together. My college asked for cranberry sauce and got it eventually when her meal was nearly finished. The desserts were awful to. I had panacotta which was very sweet and just tasted of cheap vanilla essence. The girls who had Christmas pudding were treated to a bown lump of sludge. You could not see any fruit in it. We were not served coffee. This cost us £34.95. In the past this has included a half bottle of wine. Not this time!. When the disco started they turned the lights off so we couldn't see each other. Someone must have dropped a glass of drink on the dance floor. There were pieces of glass all over it, although we complained nothing was done. We all left the party early.
-4; Stayed at this hotel 16 & 17 November 2013 to celebrate our Ruby anniversary with our daughter. There was a corporate do and the guests did not care if they kept you awake most of the night. Couples arguing, door banging and the fire alarm was set off. We went out for lunch on the 17th and on our return to the hotel found we couldn't get in to our room we had to return to reception for them to renew the key - the room hadn't been cleaned and there were not fresh towels. Housekeeping knocked on our door at 5pm we told them not to bother as we were trying to catch up on sleep we didn't get the night before. On our return home on the 18th November we were extremely annoyed to find out that relatives had arranged for the hotel to put champagne and chocolates in our room - we did not receive these so all in all it was a weekend that we do not want to repeat !!! 
-4; smelly, old, overpriced and really trying to take you for a ride (charging stuff that never happened). i still cant believe we paid so mcuh money for this room and service and breakfast.no toiletries int he bathroom, the bath tub had cracks and holes and the brekfast buffet had the poorest quality. 
-4; We were dining at the amazing Le Manoir which is 2 miles down the road and stayed here rather than having to drive back to London after a 10 course dinner. The hotel is truely revolting and is probably no more than a 2*. I could not get out of there fast enough. I suppose I should not have expected any better @ £80 per night but the hotel markets itself as 4* and it certainly was not that. 
-4; We arrived for our tea a little early we where asked to wait till appointed time. Other people were arriving before time but were shown straight to a table, having at last been seated we were asked what we wanted to drink and what sort of scone we required, our tea arrived but nothing else we sat and watched people coming in and being served and still we waited and waited we were sat waiting for 45 mins and still no meal, eventualy we were told there had been a communication error and our meal would be out straight away, but still we waited, we ended up very disappointed with no meal, when ask to speak to manager we were told he was not there,which we later found out was untrue, this was such a disappointment as this was a present for my friends birthday I feel we were not treated properly and fobbed of , for such a bueatiful place maybe a course in customer service would help. 
-4; Sunday lunch was appalling!! my meal was roast turkey swimming in gravy as i soon discovered meat was bad!! potatoes under cooked including my daughters jacket potatoe which should of included cheese and beans instead a half cooked potatoe three beans and four gratings of cheese, no cranberry to accopmany turkey will not be returning to eat there again. 
-4; We have stayed at the Swan before and because we're theatre fans, this was the third stay we'd booked at this hotel and the sister Alveston property this year. Our room was fine, onto the courtyard at the back, but when we got back from theatre on Friday night, we were unable to sleep because of the awful noise at a party they were hosting - which opened out onto the courtyard our room faced. People banging doors and making noise till long past 3 am.... Saturday night there worse - a band and loud microphones and loads more noise - so much so that gone midnight we checked out and drove the 170 miles back home knowing that we had more chance of sleep by leaving - so we paid for a room we were unable to use.   I spend upwards of 75 nights a year in hotel rooms and this was ridiculous - why the guests werent in the area facing the band we'll never know. The staff on duty were fabulous and said that they'd had loads of complaints (both nights) but they were unable to do anything. A week later we were offered us a 50% off stay next time - what a joke - if we spend MORE money with them they'll try to see if they can get it right next time?????   if you're planning a weekend in Stratford - dont use this hotel unless you're deaf or able to sleep through anything. Its a great pity that its not better managed - other hotels deal with parties, weddings and other guests so why this hotel struggles is a mystery. So a lovely weekend that we'd looked forward to was ruined. 
-4; Access to the spa is down some very steep stairs....so difficult if you are disabled. The spa itself is under the hotel, with no natural light. The ambience is poor, with 8 or so bright red plastic chairs and two tables filled with empty dirty cups. The spa was dark and there was an an overwhelming smell of chlorine. We were shown to,the changing rooms. These hold lockers for 21 people, but the room is so narrow and small that if four people tried to change at once you would be nudging each other in the bottom or chest. There is one shower with mould on the ceiling and one toilet with a door that does not close properly and with the door handle hanging off. The floor tiles were filthy especially around the edges and there were only two tiny changing rooms. Much to our dismay the spa experience day did not include robes and only a thin well used towel. You could hire robes at £5 each and we were advised this was good as you could be asked for up to £20 a robe at other hotels. We have never been denied robes at other spa hotels. The quiet room had about 6 hard chairs and during our visit there the workman arrived to look at repairs. We were invited to use the pool upstairs near the restaurant, but discovered that it also held swimming lessons for the local school children...so not the relaxing day we were expecting. Our package included a cream tea....well whilst the scones were fresh and home baked, there was some type of cream ..( not the luxury Dorset clotted cream we were expecting) but only enough for one person. We booked tea for 2.30, but after three requests for our tea and a trip to reception, it was plonked on the table on three cracked white dinner plates half an hoour late. The hot chocolate was cold so we asked for fresh ones. They removed our drinks, both of which had been sipped, reheated them and then gave the cups back to us with no idea who should have had which cup.....nice. We asked for a teaspoon and some sugar, but where told no one normally asks for spoons or sugar so we couldn't have any! The sandwiches were not delicate and they were so bad we could not tell whether we were eating egg or cheese. when we complained, we couldn't help but overhear other guests stating that the cream tea was a joke. i have to say however that when we asked to cancel the treatments we had booked because we were upset by the whole experience, the spa manager attended to us immediately, expressed genius concern on hearing that we had had a poor experience. He made notes and offered to refund the cost of the treatments we had booked and to provide us both with a glass of champagne. This was a very kind gesture. We did stop For our thirty minute facial. Mia gave us both a wonderful and relaxing mini facial which we both thoroughly enjoyed. I have to say, the spa staff were very polite but I feel they are greatly let down by the facilities. I would never go back to this dreadful place. 
-4;" Booked over the phone, was told the price included breakfast. On arrival I double checked the price I was about to pay included the breakfast and was informed it was room only. They asked to see my booking confirmation but I hadn't ever received one, when I checked my email address on their records they had spelt my name wrong so the email had never got to me. The woman on the reception desk was totally unhelpful and really couldn't be bothered to deal with me. I asked how much breakfast was and was told £6.95 per head. I said I would sort it out with her later as we had to get ready for the function that we were staying there for, the receptionist said &quot;that's not a problem&quot; and it was left at that. The next morning I rang down to reception to ask if it was £6.95 for a children's breakfast too and I was then told &quot;oh no breakfast is £13.95 per head, it's only £6.95 if you book it at the time of check in&quot;. Not once was I warned of this by the totally unhelpful receptionist and not once did the words &quot;I'm sorry&quot; slip from her lips. My family and I were totally disgusted, we felt all they wanted to do was take money from us in any way possible. The room was completely basic, I ran a bath for my two children and the hot tap made a horrendous noise. How many towels do you think were left in our room for a family of four???? Two!!!! My husband and I had to use damp towels after our children. Our mattress was extremely hard and my poor 1yr old had to sleep in a travel cot where the mattress felt like concrete. I'm very disappointed in our stay at the Mercure Tunbridge Wells, my husband often works 7 days a week so family weekends like this are a rarity and sadly ours was ruined by the accommodation. We certainly won't be back "
-4; Stayed as part of a girls getaway, in two separate twin rooms.   One room was clean & seemed to have all toiletries & refreshments. However the other room, did not & also was not cleaned correctly. We were left with ONE bottle of sparkling water (in a room for two people?), which already had the seal broken. No still water available. Also we only had one pillow each, no option of two (unlike the other room). ONE bathrobe, which is helpful if you both want to shower! We also had the last remaining strands of a toilet roll. & finally a towel, which was NOT clean - make up and the contents of a persons nose!  Although it may seem like I'm being overly pedantic, basic cleanliness is an absolute must when you are paying to stay somewhere. With the staff that are employed at the hotel, I cannot see how this would be a problem. 
-4; I don't know I'd we only had a terrible experience because we booked a budget room, I can only imagine those giving 5 stars booked the deluxe ones. I have to say our bad experience was partly our own fault, we visit Brighton regularly and know this hotel backs directly onto a multi storey car park, we were still surprised to have a room with frosted windows which made it quite dingy. The facilities were poor, no  drawers to put clothes in, bottled water supplied but this was tepid as the room was so warm and there was no fridge, just two teabags and rather bizarrely only one chair by the table We booked over the phone and it would have been nice if it had been mentioned that the check in was later than normal. We arrived at 2.00 and joined a very long queue of people obviously under the same misapprehension as us only to be told once we reached the front we had to wait until 3.00, something any of the several porters standing around could have told us and saved us standing for so long. We then mistakenly thought we might have a coffee whilst we waited, only to be told very shortly when we went to sit down that if we wanted coffee we would have to stand at the bar, tables were only for those who had made advance reservations. Fortunately we knew there was a costa just by the hotel, we returned again at 3.15 to join yet another long queue, they really need more than two receptionists at peak times. After standing for ages again we reached the desk only to be told our room still wasn't ready, and wouldn't be until after 4.00. Still nowhere to sit down, toilets that had seen better days and the entire first afternoon of our weekend waisted. The breakfast was decidedly average - a 4* hotel where you not only have to make your own toast but with only white medium sliced bread, no rolls,toasting muffins or even brown bread. You had to get in quickly to get a muffin cake, they weren't replenished, there was no choice of yoghurts and very little fruit. We came back to the room after 4.00 the second day, and the cleaner was still in the room then, they really don't seem to have enough staff. I would say that if you want a characterful old hotel go the Old Ship, it is much better staffed, has a lovely lounge overlooking the sea you can sit in at any time and is much better value. If you want a budget hotel the New Ibis is very good, the rooms are much brighter and they have double the reception staff W    
-4; the rooms are the size of cupboards and the carpets are stained, the paint is peeling from the walls and ceilings. I booked a room here for one night when I was in London on business. The first room I was allocated was tiny, next to the clunky lift shaft and the shower fitting was broken, they moved me to another room where the window was broken and poorly covered with plastic, the shower room was so small if you sat on the toilet your knees were hitting the shower screen and I am only 5' 2'' tall. Both taps in the sink gave hot water and leaking so badly that it flooded the floor, the next room they gave me the lock was broken and I couldn't get into the room. The last room they gave me was on the ground floor and the secondary glazing was broken so the traffic noise was a problem. The tiles in the bathroom were falling off the wall, there was no kettle and the TV was broken and the building next door was being renovated and there is poor acoustics so it was like sitting in the building site. The breakfast was pathetic and all this for £280 for one night! This has to be one of the worst hotels in London, especially for the exorbitant cost. 
-4; When booked make sure your stay is not in Atlantic bay these apts are dirty dangerous and ancient. While there problems reported had still not been resolved on leaving sliced foot open on bare metal strip 4 staff came to inspect but still not replaced and new guests checking in. Butlins staff good but holiday ruined by accomodation .BEWARE 
-4; When we arrived there wasn't ant parking spaces so the chap at the desk suggested we took the disabled ones, well I wouldn't for a start and they were full anyway. Room 30, the heating was up full when we arrived so I turned it down to it's lowest setting but the room remained stuffy and too hot, I just couldn't sleep so I opened the window but there was a loud noise (extractor??) from outside so not a great deal of sleep was had. The breakfast wasn't great, the sausages were cheap as was the tomato sauce. We did complain about the lack of sleep due to heat and noise and the night was refunded. Glad I wasn't staying longer. 
-4; My friend and I stayed in this Hotel as part of the Emmerdale Tour in October! My first impression of the hotel from the outside was of a London Tube Station! We were advised before we entered the hotel that our evening meal was at 6pm, not between the hours of 6pm and 8pm. Our room was dusty, smelt musty/old, dated, filthy nets, bathroom door would not shut, no light on the ceiling in the main area (probably so you couldn't see very well), dark and dingy, the carpet was stained, all in all the room was awful! There is notices throughout the hotel advising of what the rooms will look like once refurbished! Some of the rooms must have been refurbished as some of the trip on our coach had lovely rooms. Surely only the rooms refurbished should have been used? The evening meal was total chaos! You were sat with residents you did not know as there were not enough tables, the starters were put out first, huge queue! once the main meal was put out, another huge queue and the queue was right through the tables where people were eating! We did not stay for the sweet to be served. The main meal was served to you on very small plates and was disgusting. I am surprise National Holidays even used this hotel with being such a reputable company. Other than the manky hotel, the tour itself and the day trips into Skipton and Otley and trip to Harewood House were great, the hotel totally spoilt the weekend for us. Before anyone books this hotel I suggest you contact the hotel and ensure you have a refurbished room. 
-4; Dreadful service. We had booked a table for lunch to celebrate our anniversary and walked into the bar/bistro. It was empty except for one other couple. I was wearing high heels so was clearly audible as they clicked across the floor. The girl behind the bar had her back to us and was engrossed in doing something on a screen. We waited for two minutes, conversing as we waited, without any acknowledgment from the member of staff and then walked out. Utterly appalled by this so called luxury hotel.... 
-4;"I was very much looking forward to lunch at The Woburn Hotel, however, I was gravely disappointed. The service was terrible; we had to wait until nearly the main course (which was very late) to be served any drinks at all, and there seemed to be only two very grumpy waiters serving the entire floor. The food was awful, the turkey was tasteless and cold, and my friend had a vegetable dish which looked and tasted like vomit. Would never go again and would recommend others not to bother."
-4;Subject: The Shelleys  Location: Lewes, East Sussex, England, United Kingdom, Europe  Title: booking not honoured  ID#: 153584107   On l4th Feb 2013, I rang and booked a surprise Valentine gift for my husband - a night's stay on Nov. 5th 2013 to join in Lewes famous bonfire night celebrations. At the hotel's request, I gave my credit card details and immediately received a full email confirmation. It was for a single room they sometimes let as a very small double (in our case) for £100 inc. breakfast.  EIGHT days later, I get a phone call from the hotel telling me there had been a mistake made by a new receptionist, and we had to have a room for 2 nights on Bonfire night. This is despite it being midweek (e.g. Monday and Tuesday). The cost of our stay? £240 (package dinner on one night). A whopping 140% increase on my Valentine gift, already given!! Although they apologised, they said they could easily sell the space, and absolutely no compensation for their mistake was offered, just a 'take it or leave it' email response from the manager relayed to me via the receptionist in an email.  Dismissing a confirmed booking is actually illegal - by law a hotel has to honor its confirmation, date and price, or there is no point in actually getting one!  Faced with my husband having to take an extra day off work and the unexpected cost, was upsetting. If they had offered to upgrade the room for the two days, or ANYTHING to apologise, it would have been accepted - as a very small room for two days is not so great. My email enquiry about parking costs was just ignored. With one final phone call attempt from me, they came back and offered nothing to compensate for their error, despite admitting they still had three better and bigger rooms free. The meanness of what is supposed to be a classy hotel is totally breathtaking, and out of principle I hope people avoid it at all costs.
-4; I was lucky enough to get a small tax rebate before Christmas so I decided to treat myself, my partner and my son to a Santa sleepover at Chessington, staying at the Azteca hotel on Sat 20th of December. The communication between Chessington and myself prior to the visit was good and I was encouraged to book my son's visit to Santa before our visit. I booked it for 4.15 as check in was 3pm. We arrived to check in at 3.30pm, we arrived to chaos, extremely long queues and hardly any staff checking people in. I informed a member of staff that we had to see Santa at 4.15, she said she would come and help me check in but never showed, we then approached another member of staff who took our bags of us so we could take our son to Santa.  We walked to where we would be seeing Santa and had to queue for about 15mins we were then taken to Santa by and Elf, they were both lovely and my son enjoyed it, he opened the gift after we left and was really disappointed, he got a really cheap looking game of which he still hasn't opened, considering the stay was just over £300 this was really poor. We then went back to the hotel to check in which was a lot smoother. Our room was very nice but quite a walk.  I had previously booked for the restaurant as I was advised to do so, again we had to queue for about half an hour, what was the point in booking?? the food wasn't particularly nice either and table were left for ages with dirty plates etc. on them. We then went to the room where there was entertainment only to find there was no where to sit so resorted in sitting on the floor, the entertainment was really poor so we left. We sat in a quieter area for the rest of the evening which was an absolute mess with drinks and food left on the tables. My partner went to the men's toilet and slipped on a wet floor too.  Overall the experience was extremely disappointing and absolutely not value for money, the whole place was completely understaffed and this showed. I would strongly advice families to think twice before doing the Santa sleepover to save disappointment. 
-4; The hotel is in need of refurbishment. The room we stayed in was filthy and poorly furnished. It was like staying in a bedsit. We attended a function and they hadn't even wiped down the bar. It was thick with dust to the point where you couldn't even drink through the straws they were so dirty. We were so put off we left before breakfast. Just wanted to get home and get clean! 
-4; Buffet on offer at 24.50 per head, food kept running out, pizza I ordered was cold, steaks over cooked, service very poor. No atmosphere and very out dated. The waiters had very poor English so was hard to communicate . Would not go back to eat there again 
-4;"On arrival at the Old Ship in Brighton, the lobby and check in was promising. From there, it just went downhill. Our room -Room 101 is dark,depressing, scruffy,small and lacks much daylight. It is in need of a makeover. We awoke on the first morning to water dripping through the ceiling of the hallway outside our room. It was even worse in the bar dowstairs with buckets and basins failing to catch the numerous leaks, so resulting in soggy carpets. My husband went to use the gym and I ordered breakfast in the bar (trying to avoid the leaky ceiling). My husband was evacuated from the gym after around 10minutes and the rest of the hotel was evacuated around 30minutes later. We were asked to go to the hotel next door and were given coffee/tea. We were advised to return to the hotel after about 1hr. Nobody apologised or explained, but I assumed that we were evacuated because of fears that the electrics would be affected (this was later confirmed in an email from the manager). On checking out I (wrongly) assumed that we would be offered a part refund or a token apology. Unfortunately this was not forthcoming. At the time of checking out the duty manager was occupied with the police so I was unable to voice my dissatisfaction. I subsequently emailed the manager and detailed my dissatisfaction. He replied very promptly but offered no recompense but stated that &quot;Unfortunately Brighton experienced a months rainfall within a matter of hours and drainage both at hotel and throughout Brighton, were unable to cope with this.&quot; I find this a very unsatisfactory excuse and in no way acceptable. My house experienced the same downpour and it did not leak. I suggest that this 4star (really??) hotel invest some money in repairing their roof and cleaning their drains. No apology or refund was given, just the manager's regret that I felt the need to send an email!"
-4; What a disgusting filthy place Just spent 3 nights there with my family and will never go again We where in our motorhome and my son and family were in their tent There was not hot water in the Porto shower blocks, the shower cubicles were filthy, the main shower block was filthy no matter what time of day you went No toilet paper most of the time The tents, caravans were crammed in like sardines Noises well into the early hours of the morning Too overcrowded Too noisy Too dirty Sorry we not be visiting again 
-4; Stay clear. I have never ever EVER written a bad review for a hotel. But me and my boyfriend actually laughed at HOW bad this actually was. Check in: the queue was out the door of the hotel. It took us 45 minutes to check in. Staff weren't very helpful. After finally getting to our room - it stunk. Swimming pool was like the local community centre. Not 'spa break' material by any stretch of the imagination. We were booked in for the 3 course meal with wine so was bitterly disappointed to be told it was a self service carvery! Potatoes were soggy and chewy! How !? Tomato soup was basically a tin of chopped tomatoes and dessert was Costco fudge cake. Which was nice but again not what you expect. The 30 minute back massage lasted 19 mins from the minute I walked into the room to walking out clothed. This was ridiculous as we booked to be massaged together and we're told when we turned up that a therapist calls in sick (it was Sunday 11am so she was obviously hungover)! No apology whatsoever. They just said: so you'll have to go in one after the other. You would think they would give you extra time because of this rather than cut it by a third!! I want my money back to be honest because this was not as advertised. The pillows were that bad I had to use wet towels. 
-4;We weren't staying at the hotel, but booked a table for cocktails at the Octagon Bar for early evening on Saturday. On arrival we were pretty much ignored by the staff, but managed to attract the attention of a waitress who showed us to our table. Imagine our astonishment - another waiter came across while were were taking our seats to rudely say that wasn't our table. We explained his colleague must have got mixed up, that we had a reservation and could he check which table was ours. He refused to check. As the bar was busy we had no option but to leave (though were very happy to by that point!!). I've never encountered such rudeness before and have no idea what prompted it. We were 8 smartly dressed girls, absolutely sober, with one heavily pregnant lady in our group.
-4; First off, let me give you a little background.  I grew up on Reading Road (397 – which has now been demolished) so I have a very soft, warm and fuzzy place in my heart for this area in Winnersh. I can remember back when the pub had no hotel in the carpark. When the hotel was built, my mum worked there as the housekeeper for some time. We also visited at least once a week to have a go on the jukebox and order a mandatory slice of chocolate fudge cake – many happy memories were made there.   Now, in 2015, I am living in East Sussex, running my own business. My graphic designers for my new website live in Reading (no coincidence), as well as my old school friends. On top of this, my father is buried in Hurst (just down the road from The Pheasant) so I like to visit as often as is realistically possible.  When booking our room at The Pheasant, I was outraged at the price (£204 for one 'Family Room' for two nights). I'm not entirely sure that any 'average pub' in England would ever ask for that amount of money. However, due to the afore mentioned sentimental values, I reluctantly agreed and paid the £102 deposit.  Upon arriving at the hotel (just past 12pm), we thought it was worthwhile to pop in and ask if there was any chance we were able to check in. We were completely ignored by the owner while she was explaining to another member of staff how to count barrels. After what can only be described as an 'awkward' amount of time, we were checked in early (albeit reluctantly by the owner). We were then informed that breakfast is at 7.30 – 8.45am (which is included in the price) – there was no way we were going to be able to make that in time on either of the mornings due to having late meetings each previous evening. This made us feel slightly cheated by the price we have paid for an all inclusive B&B.  A quick run down of the room: one double bed with a pull-out camping bed (which was EXTREMELY flimsy), windows that, when open, allow the entire car park to see in to your room (and climb in if they were that way inclined!), pillows that were flat as pancakes, old and tired 'standard' B&B furniture, a ceiling fan that provides no air but plenty of noise, a shower that was absolutely black with mould and a shower door that didn't close properly. Team all this with a shower that has next to no pressure at all and a stupidly large showerhead that won't keep itself held up unless it's pushed all the way back against the wall... you have a very substandard room. Most definitely not £204 worth!  On the first night, there were only two of us, so the extra bed was not used. Our sleep was acceptable, but I felt uneasy about the windows being open (there was no other choice as the room was very warm).  The next day, my partner and I were leaving the hotel to start our days activities and the housekeeper was outside our door (we knew this before opening the door due to them talking loudly enough for us to hear their entire conversation from our bed – thank goodness we weren't having a lie in!). During the standard pleasantries as we passed each other, she said that she would tidy our room for us whilst we were out that day. Fantastic.  We had lunch in the pub that day, which was also below par and not what I had known from the pub in the past. My partner is positive that her burger was made from pork and not beef, as described, and we ordered a side of garlic bread for £3.50. This turned out to be 3 slices of shop-bought grill-able garlic bread that you can buy 10 slices of for £1.50.  We came back that evening to find fresh towels in our bathroom. However, these weren't the standard (cheap and coarse) white towels we had had previously. We now had old, brown towels that looked well past their use by! However, I shrugged this off and continued to have my evening shower as usual.  By this time, we had our third guest with us. He could feel every slat in the single bed and has the most uncomfortable nights sleep he has had in a very, very long time. Not the best experience for a 52 year old man!  The next day, checkout was at 11am – but we found ourselves leaving at 10am as none of us felt we wanted to relax or take it easy that morning – we just wanted to leave.  Whilst myself and our guest sorted out the luggage in my car, my partner took our keys to reception to check out. She lay them down on the counter as went to walk out (we had already paid in full via the deposit and the second half was paid at check in). By the time she has reached the door, the owner (Debbie) shouted over to her to “Wait, I need to discuss something with you!”. This was done very loudly so the entire pub could hear.  When my partner went back, Debbie asked if anyone has been dying their hair in the room. When this was denied (rightly so), Debbie barked “Your FRIEND has red hair, doesn't she?”. My partner confirmed this and was shown our towels from the previous night. There were patches of tinted pink water on them (the fallout for a couple of weeks after dying your hair). My partner asked what Debbie wanted her to do about them, to which Debbie replied (demanded) payment for the towels.  I have been dying my hair for around 13 years now and I have a shower/wash my hair nearly every night. Not one of my towels at home have any permanent hair dye on them as this washes out. There is no actual dye – it's more like tinted water.  My partner had to come back out to fetch her wallet and let us know that this was going on. After a tiring two days in Reading and visibly upset at the day at my fathers graveside that I had in store, I became extremely stressed and needed to be calmed down. We all decided that, if we were paying for the towels anyway, we would ask to be given them (surely she would be binning them anyway, if she's asking us for money to replace them...?).  My partner went back in and asked how much they were. Debbie seemed to pick a number out of the air (£10) and it was paid via debit card.  The towels simply needed to be washed and the pink tints come out without any bother (and with household, every day washing liquid).  This whole experience was mortifying and completely ruined our trip. With 6 breakfasts not being eaten, but included in the rate, could the laundering of the towels (which should have been done anyway) not be paid for with that money that they saved?  Before I left Reading, I met up with an old school friend, who, ironically, lives in the new flats that have been built to replace the house I grew up in just down the road. I spoke to her about our issues at The Pheasant and she was not surprised in the slightest. She let us know that the owners that we had known in the 1990's had left and it was taken over by Debbie and co. Since then, most of my friends will not return. Everyone is of the opinion that Debbie is rude and unfriendly. We cannot agree more.  As long as Debbie reigns, we will not be setting foot back here – as much as it breaks my heart to say it.  Attached is a picture of the towels we were handed, and the towels after a simple home wash with a Surf tab. 
-4; My husband and i booked into Nent Hall Country Hotel on the way home from Scotland as a stop gap. It was absolutely awful.Our room was such a tiny room but was full of a very large four poster bed.Got to admit the bed was clean but the rest of the room was dirty.Carpet,mould on ceiling,walk-in wardrobe was really bad even the skirting board was hanging off.Windows were dirty with lots of dead flies on window sill.Bathroom full of mould. The public lounge was overfull with dirty settees the rest of the hotel was FULL of old furniture,even cupboards full and curtains placed over them to hide them.All  the windows throughout the hotel was dirty.The beer garden was overgrown with weeds and grass a foot high. The food !!!!!!!!!! was really not good.           our 
-4; After a very long drive from Devon with difficult clients my PA emailed me to say she had checked me into a really nice hotel at a very reasonable price. I was absolutely horrified when I arrived to see the dirt and rubbish outside. Thinking things would get better inside I decided unfortunately to go ahead with the booking, however my horror at the size and state of the room was beyond explanation. I checked out and drove home another 3 hours but would rather be exhausted than even try to sleep in this hovel and then even try to shower in a room that I would feel dirtier coming out of before i entered. Please do not not waste your money staying here 
-4;" Having only moved to Harrogate 1 year ago we have tried different restaurants which we have found exceptional. Having visited this one I found not only was the service appalling the time we had to wait for our meals was beyond acceptance.  Not only did I have to ask for the bill twice I ended up going to the bar to pay which I found very annoying to find 4 members of staff stood together. The waiter asked how our food was in which we replied &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; he proceeded to clear the table with no response. I have never commented on trip advisor and although we read bad reviews we thought we would try it our self first. What a BIG mistake!!!!!!!!!!! "
-4;" We had a very rare night away from our children and we were looking forward to 4* accommodation and an adult evening out! Well, we got the evening out (local restaurant, part of a chain; delicious meal) but we had a terrible night's sleep in a poor room!! Firstly, the bathroom was in a terrible state, with the sink barely hanging on to the wall (lethal! I moved the toothbrushes etc. off it as they wouldn't stay on... they slid off!!) and everything in need of a jolly good descale. The bed had a huge dip in the middle, and wasn't confortable, we spent most of the night on top of each other... and not in a good way! We brought the sink issue to the attention of the person on reception, who arranged for us to be moved... to a smaller room with an equally dodgy sink! We decided to stay put but actually wish we'd stayed at the Premier Inn! This hotel is in need of a serious refurb and upgrade. We won't stay there again. "
-4;" Nice hotel, comfortable room and bed. Good breakfast and friendly staff. But I would never stay here again as we had a sea view room and the noise was awful. Night club just below which went on till 4 am. Thousand of drunk people walking up and down the road all night and taxis driving by and parking up outside the hotel to wait for customers. Sunday morning we finally got to sleep at 5 am when the noise started to die down.£150.00 per night not to get any sleep is not good, when complained to manager we were told &quot;well this is Brighton&quot; fair enough but if we had known it was so noisy we would of opted for a room around the back of hotel. Ver disappointing. "
-4; I want to start this review by stating that I do not usually write reviews, however I feel it is necessary in this case due to how unenjoyable our stay was!  We stayed here for one night for my boyfriends birthday. After seeing the pictures and reading up a bit on the hotel it sounded like a good choice, however I couldn't have been more wrong.   First of all the general vibe from the hotel staff was overall quite negative, and it seemed as if everything was an effort for them.  We checked into our room, which was a Deluxe King Room, however in my opinion there was nothing deluxe about this room. At first the room seemed okay but after looking around and unpacking we started to notice things that we did not expect from this hotel.   -There was a funny smell in the bathroom.  -The duvet cover had been put on inside out and had holes in it.  -The room looked out onto noisy train tracks (which was not an issue for us at first, as we were not too fussed about the view. However after we had both showered the room was very hot, and we could not get the air con to work, so we had to open a window which then was very noisy) -There were only 2 bottles of water in the mini bar, which meant having to call room service when we wanted a drink.  -There were a few peanuts on the floor and on the sofa in the room. (Room clearly hadn't been cleaned well)  Now these may only seem like little things, which on there own we would have usually over looked but it was the fact that we experienced all of the above and it was like one thing after another.  On arrival we payed for breakfast for the next morning, which was a big mistake. Both of our breakfasts arrived cold and the toast was lukewarm bread rather than toast. I immediately called room service back and told them that the breakfast was cold. The man did come back and change the breakfasts for us however there was no apology, instead it just seemed as if it was an effort for him. When the second breakfast came it was edible (probably due to the fact that we were very hungry at this point) however it was definitely not worth paying a total of £35.00 for.   The only members of staff that I will give credit to were two of the ladies working in the spa, they actually smiled and engaged in conversation with us. Apart from that I found all other members of staff unhelpful and in general miserable.   When it then came to check out, the man at reception who was dealing with us did ask us how our stay was, and after telling him I wasn't too happy he then proceeded to ask why, and I explained to him the situation with the breakfast. After explaining to him he just looked at me, again no apology, nothing, he just completely ignored the fact that we wasn't happy. At this point I had really had enough and I decided not to bother going into details as to what the other issues were, as he clearly couldn't care less.  The only positive thing I can really say for the Pestana is that it is in a good location, in terms of it is close by to lots of lovely restaurants, bars and shops.   However, I really wouldn't recommend the Pestana if you are looking for somewhere friendly and luxurious to stay. In my opinion the staff need a training course in customer service and just generally need to smile a bit more. 
-4;" Last night I purchased a groupon for one night stay at this hotel. Was looking forward as the validity date was right up to our first wedding anniversary. So followed the instructions on the groupon to email or call for reservation...got response after chasing up saying that reserving through email was not possible. I then called all set with my groupon, looking forward to visiting the hotel only to be told the groupon isn't available on the date I requested which happened to be within the validity period AND was not one of the few dates excluded from the offer. The woman then proceeded to tell me no availability at that time even though I could book on the website, so her answer was no &quot;groupon&quot; availability. I would have accepted that gladly if that was stated anywhere but on checking the groupon there were no limitations other than a few dates. Found the woman very unhelpful, uninterested and feel that the hotel has completely falsified their groupon offer. I see that other negative reviews on here don't seem to have any response so am not expecting one to this but I hope others take on board the groupon issue as I'd imagine a lot of people purchased this. I've never had any issues with other hotels through groupon and usually use the groupon to tryout hotels before continuing to use them, in this case however I won't get the opportunity and have already formed a poor opinion on my experience so far. Any hotel groupon offer which has had limited availability has clearly stated this. To me they wanted as many people to purchase these as possible to then change the terms, another statement made by the &quot;customer&quot; service advisor was the hotel has the right to change the terms at anytime- again fair enough but next tme state it!!! "
-4; After looking forward to staying here for a two night visit, I was relieved to leave on the Friday. Upon arriving for a late check in, we headed to the Marco Pierre White restaurant expecting great things from this famous chef. It because very obvious that he spends no time here at all, except for cashing in on having his name on the menu. My fish arrived after a 45 minute wait and it wasn't even cooked. Now, I don't mind if I've ordered raw fish but I expect plaice to be cook. That night, i was kept awake until 2.30am due to noisy revellers staying at the hotel. Even a request to the front desk to ask them to go inside didnt help.   Day two was not much better - this time I thought I go for the steak for dinner. I asked for it to be cooked medium and it had burnt pieces on it. The sides served with it were Luke warm and dry, as of they had been left under the hot lights for too long.   All I can say is avoid this place as much as possible. It is not worth the money, and Marco Pierre white should be highly embarrassed to have his name partnered with it. 
-4; I booked this hotel in a theatre package as a surprise weekend away for my husbands 30th & have never been so disappointed in a hotel ever!! Firstly I booked an executive suite which on the pictures looks lovely, don't be fooled!! We got the key to the room and when we got in we were shocked by how tiny it was and then noticed our bed was 2 single mattresses pushes together, so I went to complain and was taken to another room which was even smaller and this time 2 single mattresses and 2 single quilts on a king bed!! We were asked to wait down stairs whilst they sorted a room for us, after 5 hours travelling we weren't impressed!! Once the room was ready we still weren't happy but just didn't have the energy to argue, mattresses were now zipped together, tv didn't work, no mini fridge, no docking station, couldn't connect to 'free wifi', tiny tiny room and bathroom, bed ridiculously high, I'm only 5ft felt like I was climbing a mountain to get in bed!! Food cold when served, noisy at night with traffic!! Hammering at 7.30 am Saturday morning woke us up!! Really uncomfortable bed and pillows!! Manager very rude, been trying to get in touch with him regarding my complaint for 2 week now, no luck, never there apparently! Please avoid this hotel if you like sleep, and a half decent room with a little space at least!! Don't be fooled by website pics, these rooms must not exist!! 
-4; I recently tried to arrange a group booking at this hotel for a wedding party. I was immediately told they couldn’t tell us how many rooms were available over the specific weekend and I should check the website to find out. The website only allows you to book a maximum of three room at one time so after going back to the hotel, we were told they couldn’t help us and we should try The George up the road. The attitude of the staff has been dismissive and unhelpful and we haven’t even booked a room. They clearly don't want our business. I would certainly give this hotel a wide berth – I can only image what the service is like when you actually stay there. 
-4; Bought a groupon for a one night stay. Called at 8.45pm to make a booking at 13p per minute. After 20 minutes of being on hold & reading the reviews on here whilst doing so I decided to get my money back - awful first impression. 
-4; The location was great and the pictures looked nice so thats why i booked it. However it was my husbands birthday and i thought i had booked an executive room, i also asked for a bottle of champayne to be put in the room on our arrival which i was told was no problem. Needless to say there was no bottle in the room, the room was also very plain, the bathroom door could not stay open even if you wanted it to, which you did want as you could not breathe in there. The king size bed, was two beds pushed together which didnt make much for a romantic night. The worst thing was that we woke in the night to get a glass of water each only to find the tap in the bathroomm boiling hot water, we in the end had to go to the night porter and get a bottle of water. I would not stay there again, the only great thing was the location. 
-4; Booked afternoon tea for my 30th Birthday. Even rung to confirm my booking. Arrived and they didn't have my booking. Luckily they accommodated us but the food and services was very poor.   Totally ruined my birthday treat with friends 
-4; The hotel did not accept either of my bank cards (Visa and Maestro), and since they did not allow for bank transfers either they had me go into the town to look for a Cash automatisch at 23h at night.... Extremely unpleasant when you book beforhand and paying 135 pound a night. Also, shower pressure was quite poorly. 
-4; Ordered a glass of prosecco which arrived at the table approx 10 mins later with no bubbles whatsoever! Obviously been poured from a bottle that had been opened the night before! Sent it back only to be given another, barely fizzy glass. How hard is it to serve prosecco with bubbles! 
-4; Having used several over night hotels with parking for 2 weeks over the years we were shocked beyond belief at the parking facilities at this hotel. We could barely get into the car parking area when we arrived let alone park as it was so over crowded. The cars were parked 5 or 6 deep in places with barely enough space between them to open the doors more than a couple of inches, let alone try and get out. The amount of disclaimers up around the car park gave a clear indication that the hotel was not going to be held responsible for any damage caused to your car and you also had to sign a disclaimer when you checked in. I don't see how this could be upheld though as the hotel is clearly not providing adequate parking spaces for the amount of cars they are taking in. We were told our car would be moved to a secure compound which was a field next to the hotel which was even worse. On our return at 2.30am we were told where our car was parked only to find it had been blocked in. I then had to return to reception to find someone to come out to move the other car. Parking is a complete joke at this hotel and I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. 
-4;" Stayed here for one night with parking before flying out of Gatwick the following morning. 3 adults and one 14 year old in a Vintage room (which I paid a bit extra for). When we arrived the car parking was ridiculous - cars everywhere - no where to park! Shown to our room which had a double room and bunk beds!!!! I returned to reception and asked to be moved (I do not expect an adult to have to sleep in a bunk bed). Was told - very rudely - I could not move unless I paid for another room £156. I asked, politely, if she would expect an adult to sleep in a bunk bed, she said no! I pointed out that I should not have been sold the room in the first place (I was clear the room was for 3 adults and a child when I booked). She told me &quot;it was not her problem!!!!&quot; We stayed in the room and removed the matresses from the bunk beds to the floor! Dinner was very mediocre, breakfast awful. Never again. "
-4; Do not try this hotel, the service is none exsistant, the food is just disgusting and the rooms dirty. 
-4;Beware as there is a major refurbishment going on and even the sections of the hotel that 'are not impacted'... they are. There is an overall feeling of dust everywhere. The lift area is like a building site, with cardboard and masking tape everywhere. The entrance is most unappealing - a bit like arriving at an old office building. For £170 it is not worth it at all. The experience was so disappointing that we checked out before wasting our life in a place that is so depressing. Amazing that the room fees remained the same. There are plenty of B&B's - even the Doubletree or Cambridge City Hotel are worth considering before shelling out for a room here. Also the rooms are so tiny and the furnishings tired there is no sense of freshness/cleanliness. Very disheartening experience. Never will grace these steps again... shocking.
-4; Went to this hotel on a spur of the moment as a romantic break for me and my boyfriend. On arrival, we were impressed (distracted!?!?) by the stunning grounds the hotel are set in, however this was soon forgotten following a catalogue of dreadful events.  Our first hotel room seemed lovely, however after deciding to get changed to visit the spa, I was horrified when I picked up a bra from the floor and realised it was not mine! It was not hidden and in plain view. We complained and the receptionist came to investigate (goodness knows why she spent five minutes looking behind the curtain it was near!). She said she would talk to a manager and get back to us.  Over an hour later, and feeling very uncomfortable in a room which has obviously not been cleaned well. We visited reception as said we were not happy staying in the room and would like to be moved. They agreed to move us to the top floor, not once did anyone offer to assist us with our bags.  The next room (an exact replica of the first minus the dirty underwear) seemed fine until we realised the air conditioning was broken. Being over 20degrees the heat was unbearable and we made the familiar visit to reception who sent the manager to investigate. After trying to make it work, he advised us he had no idea what the flashing spanner symbol meant and we requested yet another room. He said he would see if he could upgrade us given our experience and would advise us once checking.  Many sweaty minutes later, he called our room to say the hotel was fully booked but they coincidentally had someone leave a day early (really?!?!) and if we waited for the room to be cleaned we could have that.   Again, no offer of help with our bags but finally at almost 9pm we moved to floor two. The room was another replica but the upgrade seemed to be a tiny balcony which was too late to benefit from. After a rushed shower and change, we headed down to the restaurant.  We were kindly given a bottle of 'champagne' ... Prosecco actually but they obviously thought we were not very cultured ... and we enjoyed an a la carte three course menu.  All was well??  Um no, at half past 2 in the morning, my partner awoke with horrendous stomach pains and proceeded to be violently sick for two hours.   Exhausted and desperate to leave, we went to check out in the morning and advised the receptionist of my partners illness. She agreed you could see how poorly he looked and that it could be food poisioning. She then said he would need to see their Health and Safety Manager to report it and would also speak to her manager.  She returned smiling saying they would take something off our £190 bill as compensation for what had happened. After lots of typing, she delightedly showed me our new invoice will a 'wonderful' £30 deduction for our trouble.  Expressing our disgust and how insulted we were we requested to see the manager. Some minutes later, in walks the most arrogant and pompous man I have ever had the misfortune to meet, Charles the manager. His first impression with me was awful given he said hello to my partner and shook his hand and yet ignored me until I forced an introduction. Instantly, Charles was extremely hostile with a very loud and agressive voice. Apparently, he is proud of his housekeeping and it was not their fault the bra was hidden behind a curtain - It wasnt behind the curtain it was on full show, but does that mean dirt behind curtains is acceptable there? Secondly, it was not the hotels fault nor responsibility that the air conditioning had broken - umm well it was broken on our arrival in the room and you would expect for basic checks to be carrried out. And to top it all, he then advised my partner that he could not prove that he has been so sick due to what he had eaten and therefore would not accept it had happened! As tempers frayed, I said I was not prepared to be treated like that and wanted ot leave.  Charles then said we could leave (without paying) but proceeded on escorting us out of the hotel whilst shouting at us the whole time! He even continued shouting across the courtyard as we made our way to the car.  Sincerely the most awful experience ever, I have had better treatment in a Travelodge! 
-4; I had my wedding at Fanhams in August and looking back on my 'special' day I'm dissapointed. For the cost to have my 88 guests stay for the ceremony and wedding breakfast I'd expect alot more.  So many of my table decorations went missing, not to mention ice cream that I pre-paid for! I can't believe I have to chase up so many little things, even a few days before my wedding day. And now I've mentioned what shouldn't have happened I get nowhere! Not very good customer service. I don't recommend Fanhams Hall unless you can spend every single spare second rechecking every detail with them. 
-4; Shabby decor, grubby towels, greasy, high fat, cholesterol ridden breakfasts.  An owner whose rudeness and abrasive attitude fitted well in this low end establishment.   a stereotypical bed & breakfast caught up in a time warp from the early 20th century.  Places like this give a poor image of b&bs at a time when they need it most. 
-4;I have been for a fair amount of afternoon teas and this one was by far the worst. My friend and I eventually managed to get through on the phone number given and booked for a Monday afternoon. When we got there, the receptionist showed us to an empty dining room, where a waitress looked surprised at having customers and told us we could sit anywhere. It was a blazing hot day, and the dining room had a glass ceiling so the place felt like a greenhouse. We were given a tea menu, which had a poor selection of Twinings tea bags, and I then had to wait 15 minutes while one of the receptionists ran to the shop to buy a box of the tea I'd asked for (although the waitress didn't actually bother to tell me this until I asked why it was taking so long).  We still hadn't received any food by this time, and when we asked about this we were told the person who does afternoon tea doesn't actually work at the hotel and was running late. She arrived 25 minutes after our booking time, and offered us a glass of sparkling wine before the food. After 10 minutes, I had to find a waitress and remind her of this, after which we received glasses of cheap non-sparkling chardonnay in sparkling wine glasses.   The food then arrived on a cake stand that hadn't been screwed together properly. The sandwiches were below average, the portions of clotted cream were ridiculous so we had to ask for more. The cakes consisted of half a cream doughnut, a meringue, a miniature cupcake and a small piece of chocolate cake that I recognized as being from Tesco. We left most of the food, and had to use the nasty wine to wash away the taste, as even this wasn't as bad as the cakes.  In addition, there was one toilet for guests which had a large bag of rubbish outside and some cleaning products so I couldn't get to it and had to try again later.  The service and standard of food was appalling. The person who runs the afternon teas has no idea what one should actually be like, and is providing an extremely poor service a prices comparable to the Park Lane hotel (which is excellent). The quality of the afternoon tea at Topham's isn't even worth £10 per person, let alone £32.  Stay well away.
-4; Arriving for a friends wedding I booked in for one night. there was some confusion over a double booking that was sorted and was given a Junior Double Room. I have travelled a lot and this room was not a junior it was so small and was not happy I asked for a larger room and paying to upgrade I got a kingsize that was two single beds put together that separated during the night. The following morning not having been told what time breakfast was served I checked the hotel information that indicated it was 10:30am. Arriving at 10:15 I was surprised when I was told that breakfast was finished. Despite showing the evidence which apparently it was my fault that the hotel should have updated this 2 weeks prior and I should have known!! I was not happy and asked to speak to the manager who guess what was the same person that did not own he problem earlier and didn't even ask whether he could fix it....to add insult to injury I then was charged twice for the room...which has thankfully been reimbursed....BUYER BEWARE! 
-4; Room was tried frayed carpet edge, bed faced up hill , no feather pillows even though it was an option on booking which we requested, expensive extra for a z bed for my child , noisy party upstairs two floors above ran late into the night , hotel isn't very sound proofed 
-4; The room was so hot & the windows did not open. I asked at reception for a fan which they reluctantly supplied but due to the lack of plugs & length of room, it made no difference! Slept on sofa instead. 
-4; Room was large,well equipped and comfortable. Disappointed that television didn't work and some of the furniture was worn out. The bed was soft and the tapsbin the shower were missing fittings. The location was great, only 10 minute walk into the middle of Oxford. The room and bathroom were clean, only the carpet could have done with a clean. Overall not too bad. 
-4;We stayed one night Friday in room 723 it was disgusting stank of smoke our room was near staff quarters and fire escape so maybe they were on there but in the morning i also smelt of cannabis my hubby said if we had been earlier to check in and not in such a rush i would have got this room change and its not like me to complain but this was terrible
-4; we arrived at check in early and was told we would have to wait so headed for the bar .checked in later all went well .had a swim and got are selves ready for a nice pre booked dinner .but was told dinner starts at 7pm bt it was 630pm .that is what we booked left standing around with my 101 year old grandmother .i asked can we be seated as she can not stand long .i will have to ask was the reply finally seated and nan cut her leg and tights on broken chair .no ballon at table as promised .dinner was good breakfast fine too. but what a shock when we got back to room to find are beds had been striped and we had not checked out .i was very upset and told them so but they did nothing poor service.stunning building but poor 
-4; Arrived at 7.30pm to be told they had no booking even though booking was made 3 weeks prior blamed late rooms.com. Told me I should have rang them to confirm booking even with my emailed confirmation. Had booked 2 double rooms for my daughter & myself as no booking they told us they would upgrade us from standard rooms 1st room twin not double so we decided we would share to be told we would have to pay for both rooms anyway even they they had no booking for us. After 20mins & a conversation with the manager he agreed to allow us to share. Well the room first impressions dark poor quality 2 single children's size beds mismatch of furnishings, dark stain on the ceiling, no heating, mirror fallen off the wall & balanced on dressing table. Requested some heating Manager brought alone a electric blow heater. I dread to think the rooms we could have been in if this was an upgrade. Worst stay ever would not recommend. Mrs A Barry Bristol. 
-4; Absolute shambles is want I would of called Friday night.we were told free bar open at 7pm on arrival we were told free bar starts at 8pm.. 9 pound for 2 drinks cost of party was 35pp to start with time for free bar want shambles 3 staff to cope with hundred wanting a drink 35 mins I waited. Only to be told 2 drinks there was 3 of us.1 sitting at the table watching the bags for safety. Only to get back and food had been served.no notice meal was cold swimming in gravy la cate not..2 southern fried chicken and 2 potatoes wedges and veg. Good money was given in good faith of a good night of promise of food and a free bar and disco.disco was spot on but your food and free bar was not.Really need to get your act together wine on tables would have been better to be going on with with the meal and those who don't drink it there would have be less at the bar. And notice to tell customers meals were being served would have been nice.  Sue edwards 
-4;Stayed here on a Saturday night with group of friends.  My friends handbag had been taken from her hotel room whilst we had been out for the evening. Upon informing reception, we spoke to security who said they would deal with the matter and keep us inform....or so they said.  My friend had to call the police herself the following morning as the hotel failed to.   The treatment my friend received was disgraceful and the hotel should be totally ashamed of themselves. They should be disgusted that something like this would happen in the hotel. CLEARLY ANYONE CAN GAIN ACCESS TO ROOMS....which in it self is worrying.   Having stayed here many times before, I will not be returning...as I would not feel safe staying or leaving my personal belongings in their rooms.
-4; My partner booked it in advance as a surprise for both of us over Valentine's this year 2015 and was a bad experience for us. First of all the welcoming from reception was poor, then we had to find our own room at second floor. Totally NOT recommended for a disabled person as we had to go up two flights of stairs to get to the lift. I thought to myself, this is a joke, right? And the room was like hidden away, even the staff we asked for help could not find it, so we kept going backwards and forward with our luggage on the narrow corridors and uneven floors with little odd steps here and there ..... Eventually we found the room, had a shower and went downstairs for a candle lit dinner. Unfortunately the meal they offered was buffet, even the steak was on the buffet... could not believe that there were no candles on the tables on Valentine's evening in the hotel, fully booked. My partner kept apologising to me for the bad turn out of the events, so we went out to find a meal suitable for our evening and got wet and cold, as we didn't prepare for that. We did find a place that welcomed us and spent the rest of the evening there, using the hotel room just for the beds. Very disappointed with the service, facilities and would NOT recommend it to anyone. The wifi was free but could not connect at all. It seemed that we were not the only ones having bad experience as we talked to other people when departed. Could not wait to go home. 
-4; I live in Broadway and often travel through Woodstock enroute to either Oxford or London and finally found time to stop off at the Bear Hotel. What a disappointment. We did not eat as we were running short of time but ordered a pot of Earl Grey and a lemonade. We asked to look at the menu do we could book for our return trip. After 30 minutes waiting in the bar, the tea eventually arrived, only not Earl Grey but Breakfast. The flat lemonade took another 5 minutes. No menu ever arrived and the total bill came to just under £9. Total joke. Never again. 
-4; We was very disapointed with our stay at Mercure in Nottingham. We arrived and our room was freezing cold. When i sat on the toilet the lid of the toilet seat fell of on my back and bottom of the seat was loose. I got a shower later on and turned the shower control handle to the left it got hotter. I checked a few times to check it said c and it did but my shower was getting hotter. I turned to the right and it got colder. The Double Rooms are rubbish and are zip up beds.  I explained to Receptionist and Front Office Manager all my problems and he came across cocky and smug. He said yes double rms are 2 beds together and he said about the heating there should of been another card in room and i said there wasnt.   I asked for a discount because I wasn't happy with the room. Chris went on to say its a 150 room at 4 star hotel. I said its not a 4 star hotel!  I wouldn't go back to this hotel and have stayed in Park Plaza last summer and it was much better. 
-4; We have recently returned from this hotel following a weekend break and i give this review on the basis that it will enable people to make an informed choice but also that the staff understand what good customer service is. We arrived and stood by the reception before somebody acknowledged our presence, we asked to make a reservation for dinner but were informed by the receptionist that the only space available was in 15 mins, at this point we had not yet checked in, he did say he could recommend some good pubs on the locality but of course the whole benefit of booking a hotel is that you can eat on site, we asked if there were any alternatives, he offered the bar which had a small range of food on offer, we had no alternative but to take up this option only to be told by the waiting staff that we could have eaten in the restuarant any way. We booked into our room which was awful, damp, noisy and cold. we asked for an alternative quiet room which was okay the first night but on the second night, sleep was impossible due to the noise of the fan from the pool. Arrival at breakfast was another non starter, we waited 15 mins to be acknowledged by the staff and then were offered a table, no explanation of the food on offer, a good morning would have been nice. The only saving grace is the spa area which is good and the range of treatments on offer and the staff in the Champagne bar, who went the extra mile for us. At checkout, we spoke to the same receptionist who checked us in, I politely gave an opinion when asked about our stay, another indifferent sorry, but it was fairly obvious, he could not care less.  It does not matter how big, grand or outdated this hotel is, the value of a warm welcome goes a long way. would we recommend this hotel, NO!. 
-4; I dropped my bag off with Concierge in the morning as had meetings all day and then a dinner with customers in the evening. It was 11pm before I could check in. I had to join a queue to check in, I couldn't believe it at this time of night. When I eventually got in front of a receptionist I had to wait whilst she called her manager to allocate me a room. I've never known this before. I was waiting for a further 5 minutes until someone came from a back room with my key.  On the floor of my room there seemed to be offices as well. It smelt of smoke. There was large cardboard boxes, office rubbish and even office furniture strewn in the corridors. It was very strange. When I entered my room, more quirks were presented. The first door on my right was a little kitchen, the second door a tiny shower room, which still had the previous guest's rubbish in the bathroom bin!!!! The main bedroom was huge, with a sofa, coffee table, table with 4 chairs, desk and seat and large king bed. The was a further corridor accessed by another door that led to 2 large walk in wardrobes. The whole place & experience was bizarre. In the morning, to my disgust I woke to find I had been bitten several times around my waist. The shower was powerful but only had a curtain so the bathroom became a swimming pool as it just spilled over the shower tray. Free toiletries were provided. Breakfast was varied and the restaurant seemed well organised. It was very busy. I've had lunch in the restaurant and the quality of food, presentation and service was very good. 
-4; Overall, I am very disappointed and disheartened from my stay at Mercure Manchester. Although it is in a prime location, the PRIVILEDGE room did not live up to the standard I was anticipating for the price me and my partner had paid for it, one of the reasons being the bed was very small. The room did not get cleaned everyday and the cleaner told us on one occasion she was too busy cleaning rooms elsewhere in the hotel.   The website specifies and safe deposit in the hotel room, there was not one in our room and when we called we were told that there were none available but we could use the reception one and we would have to visit reception every time we wanted to access our property. Once I asked to speak to a manager this problem was miraculously resolved.   The price for parking at the hotel is extortionate at £15 pound for 24 hours parking. As our stay was for 11 nights I chose to remove my car after 2 nights and then return it later in the stay to save money. (This made our stay slightly more inconvenient as we now had to travel by trains etc.)  On check out I was then told I was going to have to pay for the full 11 nights stay parking. I informed the staff the car was only there for 6 nights so we paid this fee for 6 nights. I have now been charged to my bank account for the remaining nights the car was not there. Had I known at the beginning of my stay at Mercure that the hotel would charge me regardless of how many days the car was there I would have left it for the whole stay, however, I was told at the beginning of my stay that I didn't need to inform the hotel i was removing or returning the car as they have a camera that notes when I leave and return to the hotel in the car so they can calculate the amount of days the car has been parked on the hotel car park and charge accordingly.   I have contacted the hotel regarding this matter and so far have been met with the attitude that I am in the wrong, when I followed the instructions given on check in. I should not have to be worrying about my holiday or my stay at the hotel after I have returned home.   I would advise anyone considering staying at the hotel to find a hotel that is better value for money around Manchester City Centre, which shouldn't be too difficult. 
-4;I had purchased a voucher for the spa day as a present for my Mother, when we arrived we was hurried through to the dark and dirty changing rooms. Getting changed was the last thing I wanted to do as they were totally disgusting, decor needed updating, flooring needed doing, windows were not frosted just a thin dirty peice of lace covering. The lockers were faulty and was we gave a key on a used bobble to lock away our belongings. Entering the Spa was even more a let down as the steam room was broken and there was a swimming lesson in progress. This left the sauna jaccuzzi and half of the pool to use. The decor, floor and facilities were all dated/worn/dirty and needed a good refurb before letting any public in to use them. We went over for afternoon tea to try and re-kindle some kind of joy to be waiting half and hour and still not be seen to, we left in the end. What a bad experience! I would not recommend this place to anybody. I am truly embarrasssed to have taken my Mother here for a day of relaxtion all it casued was stress and disappointment completely ruined the day.
-4; Know why requested to pay upfront for w/end Board meeting. Appalling service in dining room wouldn't have seen anything paid for. Waited 90 mins for pre-ordered supper, some arrived cold, uncooked, mixed up orders. Shortage of staff, slow service, kept waiting ages to be seated, cold, dirty plates and stained mugs at breakfast time. Lunch time kept waiting 30 mins for pre-ordered main course, desserts had to be taken in meeting room so late. Didn't care we were there for business meeting, not w/e jolly. Switched meeting room on morning, room not set up for mtg,long wait for tables and poor girl struggling to manage alone. Set the scene for the poor w/e. Hayley, Jade and Nicola were very helpful as was young guy who tried to keep us cheery both evenings. Just rubbish experience and we won't be going back there or any other QHotel based on that experience and will be sharing our experience with everyone. Disappointed understatement agree with everything that Kellylou81 and barbarabistro. 
-4;" I am very disappointed with my stay with you this weekend, mainly because of your extremely unwelcoming receptionists! I arrived at the hotel with a friend of mine at around 4pm on 6th July 2013. We went to Birmingham for a weekend break. We had booked two single rooms online for that Saturday night 5 days in advance. For some reason the two bookings were not linked together although they were booked at once using my credit card. When I checked in with my friend, the staff simply asked my name and my home address and routinely asked if I wanted a morning call or newspapers. He then gave me two key cards; I thought they were for two rooms. So we went upstairs before realised that both cards were for the same single room. So we came down and collected the other set of keys. The staff again routinely asked if my friend wanted morning call or newspaper. Throughout the check in, I didn’t hear one word such as welcome! If the IT system is not intelligent enough to link the two bookings together, human common sense can surely make up for it! If the staff had been a little bit friendly and asked if we were both staying at the same single room (which is highly impossible), this inconvenience would have been avoided completely.  When we checked out, similar drama happened again! Although this time, there was an extra issue with the payment. I thought the two rooms were both paid for when I booked them online. But the staff impatiently told me that was just a credit card confirmation not the payment. So I paid, and left the hotel with my friend. None of us were asked if we enjoyed our stay. None of us were given any word such as welcome! I was simply given my receipt and didn’t even hear they say goodbye! I was mortified! I never ever in 10 years living in the UK received such service. I felt something wasn’t right, maybe the check out was not completed yet, so I asked the two receptionists if that was all. They said it was. Again, no goodbye, no welcome again, no nothing!!!  The room and everything else was about average. Nothing stood out. That wasn’t important. We were there just for one night and the location was great that was exactly why I booked it. But after this horrifying experience with your hotel staff, I doubt I would stay with you again nor would I recommend you to any of my friends!  I wasn’t around when other guests checked in or out, so I am not sure if we were the only ones received such horrible services. What I am sure is that we are both Chinese however I really hope this is not a case of racism!!! "
-4; After booking a family room with two double beds two months previous,I was contacted by the hotel a few days before to be told that my room would not be available and they was going to upgrade me to a suite,it was explained to me that they would still accommodate my requirements ie the two double beds.when we got to the hotel and went to our room I found that we only had one double bed...as there is myself and two teenage daughters this was not acceptable,I phoned down to reception and explained the situation as was told they would have to check out my story,a hour later I phoned again and was told a bed would be brought up to the room,when it turned up it was a fold away camp bed,now the time is getting on to 9 pm,I went down to reception and had to again explain,the lady disappears for 20 mins and tells me they will move us and to go and pack our things,we did this and waited for another half hour,when we got to the new room it was the one I had booked originally weird.It spoilt a nice treat for my family,then while adjusting a lamp in the room so we could sleep the electric went off completely,by this time now 11 pm I did not want to be bothered so we had to use the bathroom in the dark,faulty towers it is and dirty and has a curry smell throughout the building,I have seen better hostels when I was a youngster,I have stayed at many hotels around London and would say this was is vile. 
-4; Stayed for 2 nights with friends in October. Hotel welcome OK and although 2 weddings on first night, food and service for evening meal lovely. Looked forward to the next day when wedding guests gone and hotel less busy......However how disappointing. Leisure facilities dreadful. Pool not particularly clean, sauna not working and jacuzzi didn't work, lights went out suddenly and no lockers- changing room is the toilet!  Second night, food terrible-Mine went back and not offered replacement so my Sunday dinner consisted of average starter and several g&t's. Staff, especially waiter and bar staff wonderful and tried to do best.  Manager 'listerned' to our issues before we left but sadly don't think will revisit which is a shame really as great base for Shropshire. Shifnal nice place and if money spent the hotel could be lovely. Fully understand why nice wedding venue as photographic location though. 
-4; Enquired via Q hotels website cost and availability of an overnight spa stay for 6 people -received very nice reply quoting £119 pp.Needed to agree with everyone and also what treatment was required to book so it was 5 days later when I tried to confirm and book. To my horror was told cost was now £155pp and when I queried this was informed prices can change up to 4 times per day and they operate a similar system to an airline-the more rooms they sell the higher the price goes! Asked if there was any negotiation on this but not so politely told no! I asked to speak to a manager and finally she also told me there was no change -I explained would be bring 6 people and a further 3 for the meal at night but not interested.Very disappointed at level of customer service especially as when it was a De Vere hotel the service was first rate. Will not be going for the hen night and doubt will be using what was a fine hotel again. 
-4; The beds were extremely old and uncomfortable, the food was awful - there is certainly no 'fine dining' as suggested. The bathroom was dirty and the room was extremely hot even though it was very cold outside and we had turned the heating off. The only positive was the friendliness of the staff. We would definitely not recommend this hotel. 
-4; rooms not up to standard, couldn't understand a word anyone was saying as majority of staff are forgeiners when asking staff for assistance I got no decent response I will never step foot in there again and I advise you to do the same 
-4;First time I'd been to the hotel when I attended a conference today and I was shocked at the poor level of cleanliness. The disabled toilet was filthy - and this was months, if not years of dirt on walls and door, I flagged this up to the front desk and although they got a cleaner they didn't seem surprised. All doors seemed very dirty so there seemed to be poor general housekeeping and it left you not wanting to eat there. Even budget chains (Premier Inn/Travelodge) are spotless in comparison and it's a long time since I've been somewhere with such poor standards - if I'd have been booked to stay I'd have cancelled. Also poor quality sound and projector facilities.
-4; I honestly can't believe this is a Hilton. The pool is freezing, there is a dirty crust round the pool doors and tiles , the showering area is full of mould all up the walls and around the showers its shocking its all black and crusty im still in shock! Why has management not had it all steamed clean its vial! The whole building needs a update its run down . However the staff are like all hilton staff well trained to a high standard very attentive. 
-4; A very disappointing Sunday lunch. We haven't been there in quite a while and we choose to meet there as it was a good meeting point from the M11 and A14. On arrival there were very little staff around.We found our way to the bar where the girl seemed smilie if inexperienced. My Campari arrived with no orange the 2nd was half measure as they had run out. No soda offered. They clearly were not expecting 4 of us as they seemed surprised when we explained we were waiting for 2 others although I had booked a while ago. The menu offered was a fixed price Sunday lunch. We asked if they had an an la Carte menu and they gave us a bar menu that had a few other things on ie steak,Burger,Risotto and bar snacks. On ordering our starters 2 of the 4 on offer were not available. We chose our mains and were shown to our table. The starters were fine but 40 minutes later no mains. My husband was then informed his main course had been sold out. He subsequently had to choose something else which wasn't easy as there was not much to chose from in the first place. All of our main courses came together my husbands fish being the only dish that looked fresh. 2 of the roasts looked as if they had been standing around since last Sunday the yorkshire pudding would crack teeth and the crackling was chewy. In my opinion the fish and chips would not be served in a regular high street chippie from a trainee on work experience. To add insult they brought balsamic vinegar in a pot as opposed to malt vinegar. All 3 mains were returned less than half eaten. Cheese plate was adequate, chutney was loathsome, biscuits were home made and should have stayed at home. When we were asked how things were I said less than average. There was no point in spoiling good conversation for a situation that could not be rectified. Whoever is in charge of the kitchen needs a very long holiday. All in all a forgettable experience. A reduction for the deserts and coffees were made which was not the point. My son and his girlfriend travelled from London for a lunch that could have been served in a motorway café on route with more panache. This place is well past its sell by date. 
-4;" DISASTER! Upon arrival I was informed the hotel was double booked and I would be transferred to a hotel &quot;close by&quot;. This was at 22:00 and I had an early morning flight to catch from Heathrow. The car to transfer me did not arrive till 23:00 and I was then transferred to a hotel room the size of a postage stamp in Central London! It took 45 mins to travel from the hotel in the morning to catch my flight so all in their error cost me 3 hours valuable sleeping time. No compensation offered, they should have paid for a hotel next to the airport minimum. "
-4; I stayed in the Solihull Ramada with work and I'm afraid to say the hotel was a mess. The entrance lobby was in the process of being retiled so I had to enter through the side fire exit. When I got to my room the shower didn't work, the towels were dirty, the paper was peeling from the walls and the walls were so thin I could near my neighbours conversation, as if he was in the room. The air con was so hot I'm the rooms and I could only open the windows slightly because it was on a latch, there were no thermostats in the rooms to regulate the temp. I was able to change rooms but unfortunately that wasn't much better.   
-4;My husband and I visited last Saturday, pleasant enough check in by a young man, however when shown our room up several flights of very steep stairs we discovered our rabbit hutch in the attic. Obviously this room would have been servants quarters in the house's 'heyday'. The bathroom was so tiny you couldn't even turn around in it, I have never experienced anything so small in a hotel ever! There was no wardrobe so couldn't hang up clothes ready for the evening. It was also very hot being in the attic and the receptionist did provide a fan which helped slightly. He refused to move us to a better room and stated that as we'd booked through 'Booking.com' we were allocated the smallest room in the hotel, he wasn't kidding. The previous night we spend in Northampton Holiday Inn Express and this was 100% better experience in every respect. After very uncomfortable night in very small double we thought breakfast might cheer us up! How wrong we were. Service very slow, poor quality orange juice. My husbands bacon overcooked and hard and scrambled eggs solid! My Eggs Royale was totally smothered in hollandaise sauce, sickly and inedible, we both left our breakfast and checked out. As we were given satisfaction form to complete I informed the man on reception that they wouldn't enjoy reading our comments, he apologised and assured us the Management would email us direct regarding our problematic stay. 4 days on and this has not happened! They obviously don't care so future customers beware! We are a well travelled couple and have never experienced somewhere as bad as this. No Management around and no obvious leadership.
-4; Adequate room, poor service in Bar/Lounge for Lunch eg. two of us eating given one plate and one knife. Dinner was one of the worst meals we have had for a very long time. One of the starters described on the menu as griddled baby artichokes arrived as ice cold TINNED artichoke hearts. Will not describe the main courses as they were obviously chefs revenge! 
-4;" Chose this place to use some vouchers I had been given as a present - bad choice. We were shown to a table next to a filthy window and horrible stained paintwork. The surly waitress was reluctant to move us because &quot;the other tables haven't got tablecloths on&quot; but we insisted and we not bothered by the lack of a cloth. The sandwiches were served on dried up sliced bread and were very uninspiring, the cucumber ones contained thick chunks rather than thin slices. The scones were good with enough jam and cream. The tea was fine - hard to go wrong- but we were at no stage offered any hot water to top it up. Most of the cakes were horrible - dry, tasteless and hard to tell what kind of cake they were supposed to be - we probably left well over half of them. The service ended completely once the cakes had been brought to the table. Luckily I was not having tea with the person who gave me the voucher - that would have been very awkward. "
-4; I was charged 13 and more pounds by touching the bottles in minibar fridge. The amount of money was not that much but the experience with Holiday Inn and my academic visit of MediaCity have been stained.   The microcomputer was so great to monitor the numbers of bottles you have touched. You can not complain without praising how they spend their genius on the ways in which the money is earned.   The duty manager firmly told me that I won't get any refund since I have singed an agreement which I did not have enough time to thoroughly read. They have no intention to give me the bottles that I have been charged for, neither.  When I arrived, the reception was extremely busy and short of stuff. I was given a statement to sign but no one has explained the policy for me. After more than 24 hours flight, I just need a bed to lie and can not be bothered therefor I signed something I didn't fully aware the sequences.   I won't recommend the hotel to anyone. But if you got the chance to stay, be aware of the dodgy mini bar. And the window is not allowed to open so there is no fresh air at all. That's my advice.  This experience has changed my impression about Holiday Inn, My comment is that they are not decent or hospitable as they used to be. If spending similar amount of money, I will definitely avoid staying in Holiday Inn. 
-4; As a regular user of hotels in Cambridge this was the first time that I had stayed at the hotel - and will be the last. The bath panel was hanging off and dangerous, Curtains hardly attached to poles and the bed was a mess. The room had one thing going for it - it was clean but that did not make up for the lack of care of the room and showed little respect for the guests. Also even for Cambridge it was expensive. 
-4;" I came for a 2 night break with a friend. We chose Grand Harbour as it looked the nicest hotel, had a spa and was overlooking the sea. When we arrived to check in our room was on the first floor. All you could hear was the traffic from the main road. It didn't say anywhere on the website that there is a BUSY main road between the hotel and the sea. We came back down to reception and aksed to be moved as it was just to noisy with the traffic. We were eventually moved to the 3rd floor. You could still here the road but it was marginally better. The rooms are extremely dark even with all the lights on. The bathroom was in desperate need of a refurbishment - cracked tiles, a toilet that wouldn;t flush unless you mvoed the handle about 10 times up and down.   We had dinner included on our first night. After asking for one glass of tap water 4 times it eventually came. We had to send one of the main courses back. The plate was so hot you couldn't touch it but the food was barely luke warm. We then ordered desserts and waited over half an hour for them to come. While we were waiting for the them the waitress came and apologised and offered us a complimentary tea or coffee.   The spa treatments were amazing but we couldn;t even sit by the pool and relax. It was so cold we were both shivering and that was before we even went for a swim!!!  I used to work for De Vere venues many years ago and it used to be a fantastic company with wonderful hotels. After staying here I am extremely disappointment and would not recommend this hotel to any of my freinds and this has now put me off staying at De Vere full stop ever again. "
-4;" After great reviews online I decided to treat my aunts and cousins to Hanbury manor's afternoon tea with champagne deal.   Unfortunately it started off very badly and I felt the staff did not make any extra effort to appease the situation at all. We were sat in the main restaurant for afternoon tea and decided to start the afternoon with a glass of champagne each. Unfortunately the waitress dropped a couple of the glasses and soaked my aunts back and my trousers. We all got up and started to pay my aunt dry as she was soaked through. My cardigan, chair and trousers were wet too but the staff didn't really know how to handle this at all. A man who I assumed was a senior manager came over and said they were going to bring some t shirts so my aunt could change and they would &quot;dry clean&quot; our clothes while we were having our tea. After a further 10 minute wait we were brought two t shirts which my aunt changed into. At no point did any of the staff come and replace our napkins until I requested them nor did they offer any sort of compensation for the mishap. I had to ask someone to change her very wet chair. I would have expected them to have at the very least to have offered the champagne complimentary and to offer my aunt her afternoon tea for free for the fact that their staff drenched her in champagne five minutes into us sitting there.   When our clothes were brought back, it was obvious it was merely tumble dried. They were brought back in a pile not even folded and they certainly were not dry cleaned! My aunts cardigan had shrunk and although we joked about it at the time when she put it on she was visibly upset as it had shrunk! My cardigan was crumpled up so I couldn't wear it and the clothes smelt exactly the same as they did when we gave it wet.  This was our first experience of afternoon tea at Hanbury manor and sadly not one I would repeat. As nice as the food was we had to wait for things when we requested them and really for such an establishment not something I would have expected. I felt they handled the whole champagne incident badly. When they brought the bill to me the young lady said they had removed the service charge which may I add is &quot;optional&quot;! Clearly she felt she was doing us a service by taking it off.  Sadly I was not I impressed and neither were my family members. Shan't be returning there!    "
-4; thought I had booked a relaxing de stress spa day for me and my daughters, how wrong. on arrival we were offered a drink my daughter cant have dairy so they only offered her water. the towels were not dry so had to use the pool then queue later for towels. lunch was in the bar soft drinks from the pump were flat the girl serving said she knew that but still served them to us (drinks were not included in the lunch we had to buy them?) the jacket potatoes were cold and other guests were complaining too. again my daughter wasn't offered any alternatives as she cant eat dairy so basically had a dry (cold) jacket potato. the spa showers were dingy and dirty. the facials were the only good thing about that day. overall a very disappointing day will never return or recommend it. 
-4;I arrived at the hotel on Saturday afternoon. I was due to be at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre early the next day.  Upon arrival I was informed that they had over booked the standard room we were meant to be staying in and so we were upgraded to the executive room free of charge (this should have been £230 per night). Due to the standard of the executive room I would have hated to have been in standard. The bathroom was dirty and out dated and definitely not what you expect for that price per night and of a 4 star hotel.  We ordered room service around 4.00pm of a prawn sandwich and chicken salad wrap. My £5.60 sandwich consisted of prawns between brown bread (no sauce/salad) and some crisps on the side. I left the tray outside my room and it was still there when we left at 11.00am the next day.  We went to bed at 11.00am and unfortunately were kept awake from 12 until 5.30am by the couple arguing next door. The walls were paper thin and with the arguing also came constant noise from traffic and doors slamming. I did complain to reception twice who just asked them to be quieter.  I would not recommend visiting this hotel if you are hoping for value for money, a good nights sleep or a bathroom you do not have to clean before use!
-4; arrived at 11.30pm after a horrendous journey from London to be told that my prepaid booking was not going to be honoured as they had over-booked and didn't have any rooms left. Phenomenally annoyed and wrote a very strong email of complaint. OK, I was cabbed to the Malmaison hotel nearby but this is simply not good enough, Hilton ! Told by 2 separate cab drivers that this was standard practice at the Hilton Newcastle, so beware if considering staying there. Try the Malmaison instead. It was lovely. 
-4; We have just arrived at the hotel after a 2 hour drive to be told food is not served at all until 6pm ..... we couldn't even get a sandwich. Despite being told by a kind chap who helped with our luggage (no lifts) that we could get food at any time! The barmaid seemed pretty embarrassed about it, as I informed her that they are a hotel not a B&B. We paid extra for an executive balcony room as we travel a lot and like a superior room. The room itself is very pokey and the bathroom is minute with only a shower ... One of the lights above the mirror doesn't work .... Applying make up will be interesting! No welcome at the hotel at all .... the receptionist was clearly under pressure and seemed very disinterested in us! This review has been written after only 10 minutes in the hotel .... we are currently at a pub just around the corner called the Plume of Feathers who have been more than accommodating. 
-4; Food terrible poor quality and served cold had people screaming and laughing outside room till 4am we was in main hotel our friends were put in annex which is 4mins walk outside in the elements so when dressed up in high heels and long dress it's not fun trying to find way back in pitch darkness wasn't even aware when booking that there was a annex not fun either if you want to use spa 
-4; The room was much smaller than expected from looking at website - my partner was unable to check in before me although I clearly explained on the phone when booking with credit card that I would be arriving later than her - we were unable to have late check out and there was no valet parking as I was lead to believe when booking, also woken up twice in the morning by maid even though do not disturb sign was put out - shame as its a nice location and building but not good value for money 
-4; Don't know where to start with this review, my stay was that un pleasant! Complete utter disgrace and feel robbed that I got ripped of with a 'spa package'. I thought the staff that give us are room and at reception were un pleasant. But as for the staff who give us our treatment a back massage each for me and my girlfriend. The morning after our stay! So we had to check out and rush out of the hotel were the most unpleasant people I have met in my life time! Totally un pleasant in the vitality spa. And felt like we were fobbed of with a bit of oil and a rub and sent packing. I honestly Thought it would of been a great gift for my girlfriends 19th birthday as a little treat for her to be pampered. But honestly with no exaggeration if I was looking after anybody's dog I would of catered much better or in that case any pet. If your in to ripping people of then this is the hotel for you. There satellite tv has about 2 extra channels than free view. And there AA Award winning food is beyond a joke. Lamb was disgusting, wouldn't say any of it was fresh. And seen prove of this in the cafe when the woman who was lovely who worked in there ran out of prawns for my jacket potato. And then come out with a industrial size bag of frozen prawns from the freezer what tasted disgusting. On there website they sell spa packages. Beware the unpleasant people who run the vitality spa. Isn't the same company as the hotel and they do not communicate what so ever. If u want a spa package go some where else! 
-4; We thought that staying in the Hilton hotel the night before our early flight would be a lovely start to our holiday. It wasn't. The room we were given was small, musty and had obviously not been cleaned properly for quite some time. It was lovely to have a kettle in the room but would have been nice to have been provided with more than 2 sachets of coffee, 2 teabags, 2 milks and 2 sugars. Deciding that having a drink may help we went to the bar and were horrified to be charged £9.30 for a glass of wine. Later on we had a lovely meal and drink in Wetherspoons in the airport - for the same price as the glass of wine.  I would not recommend this hotel for an overnight stay to anyone and the one star is for the staff who were friendly and helpful. 
-4; Meant to be a birthday treat for me, my friend organised a spa day here. The hotel is not equipped to offer that. It has a tiny 'spa' reception area, a therapist who talked constantly through my massage so I couldn't relax and then we went to the pool and sat on the only two beds available. Basically we spent a few hours sitting around a pool and dipped in the small steam room. I'd had enough of that after 2 hours. We went for something to eat, the spa having rung to the restaurant to say we were coming. There was no one on reception, no one upstairs in the restaurant and as for the bar... empty and every table had dirty crockery and cutlery on it. It was like the Marie Celeste of bars. We went downstairs, found a receptionist who said she would send someone to serve us. After 25 minutes - yes 25 - sat upstairs waiting like numpties, I told my friend I didn't want to eat here because I doubt I'd have got any food past the lump of annoyance in my throat. We drove off to Pizza Express and that was the best part of the day. I wouldn't return again if the offer was a free day with a meal thrown in. Appalling!!! 
-4; as soon as ive got in to my room, when to the toliet, got lots pee on the seat! really dirty! the most important thing in the hotel is the toilet! i had to wash the toilet myself in the hotel room! the bed is dusty!!!! will never come back again! 
-4;Room 2 really noisy with generator coming on every 10/15 mins. I did not sleep. When I mentioned it to reception she said oh yest we know and are hoping to get it mended. If you come again don't go in room 2.
-4;I booked a spa retreat stay at this hotel for last Friday. We arrived at midday and our room wasn't ready which was fine, so we had some lunch in the bar which was lovely. The treatments we received in the spa were excellent but this is where the good comes to an end..... DO NOT BOOK A SPA RETREAT - IT IS NOT A RETREAT BY A LONG STRETCH! The hotel of course, accommodate families which is fine. However, there was a large group of people staying at the venue to attend a wedding on the following day. Their behaviour and the staffs lack of ability to manage this COMPLETELY ruined our stay. After our treatments, we went to the pool to use this and the steam room/Jacuzzi etc. The pool had a large number of children in there who were basically left to run riot, jumping in the Jacuzzi, leaving the steam room door open, hurtling round the pool, screaming and shouting and the parents were barely any better behaved. It was so awful and in a way, intimidating, that my friend and I left the pool area after 20 mins. Dinner was the same, children running riot in the restaurant and no one challenging them and same in the bar. We basically had to rush and leave every area of the hotel. To really top it all, I was then woken at 5.45am by one of the wedding party throwing up outside my room. To say I was less than impressed would be a VAST understatement. I spoke to the duty manager who, seemed reluctant to do anything but eventually, offered 50% off our bill. I was tired and stressed which was the complete reverse of what I should have been! I have since written to the hotel manager who will not improve their offer of compensation which I think is disgraceful given I did not get the experience I paid for.  I WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS HOTEL AND WOULD URGE ANYONE WHO IS CONSIDERING ANY KIND OF SPA RERTREAT TO RECONSIDER BOOKING THIS ROWDY, UNDER MANAGED HOTEL!
-4;" Whilst the venue looked stunning, the disco was fun, the service was good : the food was tasteless, cold, lacked vegetables (even with the Christmas dinner) and left me feeling rather queasy. What a shame as we had such a marvellous christmas evening the previous year we booked again; that will definately not be happening next year! "
-4; Myself my husband, my friend and her husband booked this hotel for a nice weekend away, when we arrived our first thought it was overly priced, dark and dingy, needs a major makeover, corriders to rooms all painted a dark purple, rooms dark, bar also very dark and pricey, first drink the lemonade got poured out of a two litre plastic bottle, had to return lager as it was flat, overall would not recommend this hotel as charge four star prices for a three star hotel to which we didnt know, {untill a few locals informed us of this} , alot more nicer hotels in newcastle , maybe they wont have a fancy name but it wont take much to beat this one. Will not be returniing. 
-4; I took my husband here for his 50th birthday, having booked through Lastminute.com. We arrived at the hotel, which looked very impressive, and were directed to a mews cottage. The cottage had 2 rooms which were bedrooms, one of which we could unlock and use, (which was very small) and a second which we presumed were for extra party members to use when necessary. We also had a lounge /kitchenette area and proceeded to settle in, put a bottle of bubbly in the fridge etc. We used the spa in the afternoon, had a pleasant time, and returned to get ready for dinner for 7.30. At 7pm we heard the door to the cottage being unlocked and another couple were also staying in there, unbeknown to us! No mention was made of this by reception at checking in, and we asked to have another room. The receptionist said it would be another £100.00 to have a private cottage. We said we should not have to pay this as we had no idea we would be expected to share. The receptionist then went off and asked the manager what he thought and we were then told we could pay an extra £50 to stay in the manor house. We again said we did not expect to pay any extra and was told basically that was the offer and thats that. I cannot believe the hotel knew they had 2 very unhappy people, and could have made it right but chose not to. We did not have access to a computer to check the booking email so decided to have dinner, having asked the receptionist at time of booking a couple of weeks before to a table in a corner or against the wall as it was a special occasion. When we were seated we were sat in the middle of the restaurant. I discreetly mentioned that when I booked I had asked for the said table, to which the waitress said 'well I'll have to see if I can move all of the other tables around'. So not wanting to make a fuss we said don't worry. I ordered the chicken, very average, which was meant to come with dauphinoise potatoes. No sign of the potatoes so asked the waitress who came back from the kitchen with them on a plate, and said chef had forgotten. When I booked the table and said it was my husbands 50th the receptionist said it was good to know as there was a special dessert platter. This, of course, never was seen. At breakfast the next day the fried bread was not on the plate and yet again the chef had forgotten. At checking out we had to ask for a breakdown of the bill and we were overcharged. So all in all extremely disapointing, we live fairly near and I had planned to take other people there but never again. I would advise anyone booking to ensure you will not be expected to share hostel style! I checked my booking email when home and there was absolutely no mention of the possibility of this. 
-4;" Booked a spa day but with one day's notice told that &quot;due to a dispute with management we are currently unable to perform any treatments at the moment until further notice. Due to this unfortunately we will have to cancel ...&quot; Have spent all afternoon trying to get in somewhere else but without any success at such short notice. Why can't they sort out there disputes without letting the customers down. "
-4; I stayed at this hotel in November 2014 and the service was disgusting! Staff are aggressive and rude and the decor is old and needs updating, Doors don't lock and the windows are not safe. Plumbing for sinks and loos hanging off walls and no TV in rooms. Don't stay here! 
-4; I was taken to the Midland for lunch as a retirement treat. We had to ask 3 different people to please take our order. We then had to wait 1/2 an hour for it to arrive (2 sandwiches). We mentioned to the waitress who removed our plates (and brought our bill) that we had already ordered and were waiting for desert. This never arrived even though we asked 3 more waitresses to bring it (one even came back to confirm that we had ordered desert). 2 interesting points, the place was virtually empty and we counted 6 different waitresses serving (so they can't blame pressure of service) and secondly, we were charged for desert AND a service charge,   If this is the standard of service one gets from the Midland a question springs to mind - what are the inflated prices for? certainly not the food which was mediocre to say the least (well the sandwich was, can't say anything about the desert as we never saw it). 
-4; I have stayed at the Cornwall Hotel Estate and Spa on a few occasions, and with each visit my experience has become worse and worse, to the point where I told my work I would ratheir drive from Hampshire to my 9am meeting in near-by Truro. Stiff uncomfortable bed sheets, rude staff (or no staff at the spa reception after several minutes of searching for anyone in the building) and limited hot water. During one of my stays, the room I was originally booked into had dirty brown water coming from the taps. After being moved to several other rooms where the problem persisted and was obviously to do with the plumbing of the level the rooms were on, I was told to 'make do' or pay for a substantialy more expensive upgrade in the hope that being moved to another floor of the hotel would grant me clean, safe water.   Oh, and the wi-fi? I could probably get stronger signal from my microwave. 
-4; We stayed here for the Whitsun Bank Holiday weekend and although the facilities are good the staff are diabolical. They gave us the wrong times for breakfast and for the opening of the spa and pool. (The reception staff did not know that there were different times for bank holidays). No apology was given - even when we (and other guests) were standing outside the spa waiting to go in. In addition, the spa staff gave no advice to us newcomers as to how the spa operates - they assumed we had been before and left us to wander around not knowing where to go or what we could and could not do. Will never go back.  
-4;This was my 4th stay at Hilton Bracknell. The first 2 stays were enjoyable, however on the 3rd, I left a negative review on TripAdvisor. We re-visited as we had hoped the previous experience had been an exception, however it appeared to be 10x worse. The room was certainly not big enough to be classed as a double. You could barely move around the desk/chair at the bottom of the bed and you had to literally side-step to get into bed on the far side, as it was soo close to the wall/curtains. The room was in desperate need of a renovation, with stains on the carpet, wallpaper and curtains. The mattress was very uncomfortable and needed replacing. The bathroom was clean on the surface but needed a deep clean. There were tiles missing and the door was damaged. There is clearly something wrong with the water system as the toilet took about 10-15 minutes to noisily re-fill and the sink took about the same amount of time to drain away every time you used it. The TV wasn't plugged in when we arrived and when we plugged it in, no channels worked. The desk lamp also didn't work, so no one had checked this before arrival. The walls were paper thin so you could hear people next door and walking up and down the corridor at all hours of the night.
-4;Stayed here for 2 nights – room only. This 'luxury' hotel is in a very poor condition. The outside facade is extremely uninviting, a dirty pale pink colour. The entrance and public areas are very nice but they hide the extreme lack of upkeep of the hotel. Threadbare carpets in corridors, only one lift working which appeared to have a mind of its own.  We booked a deluxe king room facing the sea. The room, whilst large was very basic with holes in the carpet, cracks in the tiled bathroom floor and chipped paint and peeling wallpaper. There was a built in wardrobe unit that belonged to the seventies with a vanity space between the wardrobes and no vanity shelf. An old chest of drawers shoved in the space completed the ‘look’. The furniture was old, mismatched and of poor quality, overall looking as if the items had been acquired from the local recycling shops – not at all deluxe in my opinion. The cupboard in the dresser appeared to once have had a mini bar fridge in it. The cupboard now is large empty space but with the old fridge door still attached – quite bizarre. The king size bed was actually 2 singles pushed together with a bed topper, which was very thin so it was impossible to sleep in the centre. The synthetic filled pillows were very hard – 1 being too low and 2, raising my head so high I got neck ache therefore a good night sleep was virtually impossible. The shower trickled water through the showerhead - very little power behind it. The floors creaked everywhere in the room and the walls are so thin that you could hear people walking along the corridor and hear the creaking floors out there too. The doors slammed shut so hard and noisily.  We did not eat or drink at the hotel or use the facilities.  This hotel does not warrant a 4* rating. It is relying on its former reputation of many years ago when it appeared to be a luxury hotel but this is definitely is no longer the case. The location is good which is its only redeeming feature but a vast amount of money needs to be spent to bring it up to a much better standard or better still, demolishing it and rebuilding a decent place to stay.
-4; What an absolute shame. Hotel is in a great location. Walking distant to everything you would want. Room was clean and perfect for my basic needs. Entrance a little shabby and worn but I can get over this. However the unfriendliness of staff I cannot and rudeness of managers I cannot tolerate. This is by no means a 4 star hotel. It could be if they knew there right hand from the left and slapped a smile on their face. They don't offer or publicise any places of interest locally. Not that I saw and I may be wrong, but it wasn't evident. I have stayed in better unrated Motels across the world and received a better service. I would recommend the Park Inn across the river. Much better service. I rated this hotel as charming, but that was for the building only the staff are far from charming. 
-4;" Oh my god im still angry about the way my stay was handled , check in &quot;room not ready unless you pay £20&quot; got room key 2 hours later as punishment for not paying £20, room dated very strange mini bar and room so hot with no way of turning it down, If you have a chice stay somewhere else..oh Billy the manager will reply to this about the &quot;refurb blah blah blah &quot; but give this one a miss AWFULL "
-4;The prices of the drinks were extortionate, three meals did not come for a table of eight until a half an hour later meaning the five other diners were finished by the time the food arrived. The breakfast was stone cold with cold plates. Would not book a wedding here
-4; The only good thing to say about this place is the location. We were only up from London for the night for an event luckily because I probably would have checked out and stayed somewhere else.  Our experience was horrendous from the start. When we checked in we agreed late check out with reception but then got an angry call the next morning when we didn't check out at the standard time. I also asked for extra pillows when we checked in and they said they would bring them up as well as the welcome cookies - never came despite asking numerous times ( for the pillows didn't bother asking for the cookies). When we checked out they just charged our card immediately despite asking to see the total bill first. We pre-booked a cab to take us to the station but when we got downstairs, they never ordered it and we almost missed our train.  The room was fine but the air didn't work and it was very stuffy and hot and all our friends that stayed there complained of the same thing.  I don't have high expectations for hotels but it was expensive and I at least expected minimum service or at least to get what we asked for but it seemed like every request was an impossible task for them.  The location is great as it is right in the centre and close to everything which I guess is what you pay for.  I think the travelogue would be better than this.   Hilton you have greatly disappointed me and I never even got the warm chocolate chip cookies!! 
-4; Me and my friend had booked a two night spa weekend in this hotel but ended uo coming home a night early here is why:  The food was cold lunch dinner and breakfast and was frankly discusting the desserts were still frozen in the middle this in my opinon is not acceptable.  the whole hotel was freezing and when we compaint to the rude manager he said they dont have heating because its a resort not a hotel this is complete rubbish we had to walk around with 3 layers of clothing on underneath out robe.  also the spa itself was cold so you couldnt sit around in your costume and the pool and sauna was also cold.  we had 3 treatments booked each for 25 minutes but each only lasted 14 minutes and by young girls who didnt even seem to know what they were doing.  the manager laughed at us when we complained and basiclly said we were lieing but having read all the other reveiws its obvious this hotel needs to sort itself out its a rip off!!!  we didnt get any compensation for any of our meals or treatments baring in mind we didnt end up having any lunch and dinner and had to go to the local supermarket to get some dinner and because of the ruddness from the general manger we ended up leaving on the saturday late afternoon as we were so annoyed and livid and this situation.  We were told the proper manager would call us today but havent heard a thing yet we are hoping to get some money back for the tratments that were cut in half and the meals that we didnt eat.  PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ESPECIALLY IF YOUR LOOKING TO GO FOR A SPA WEEKEND IT WAS THE MOST STRESSFULL WEEKEND IV HAD ALL YEAR!!!! 
-4; We stayed at this hotel on the weekend 7th August 2015 for 2 nights as a family of 4. We paid over £500 for the sea view double room, to find our seaview was on the side of the building! They put us on the 1st floor which had no lift and we had two children under 3 to carry up and down with our pram and luggage, as no help was offered. The room had cracks all over the place with parts of damp coming through so the paint was peeling away. The room and hotel was very dated, our carpet looked over 20 years old so good knows what bacteria was lurking it in. The two travel cot beds we had had holes in the sides and the sheets they provided didn't fit so my kids would end up sleeping on the base during the night as the sheets had been pulled out, so they gave us adult sheets!! Not sure why they cannot purchase proper cot sheets knowing families stay there! Our bed sheet or the duvet didn’t fit our bed either. One of the bathroom lights wasn’t working and again damp around the ceiling which is why it was on plus the shower didn't work, the taps were so old they were tarnished and looked awful and there was mould around the bathroom tap and shower glass. This was all addressed with the hotel reception, they said they fixed the shower and had the cheek to try and tell me how to use it like I don’t know how to turn a shower on?! However it was too late as we ended up having a bath. We were really upset with the quality of this hotel given the amount they charged us! We only booked this hotel because of the swimming pool and even that wasn’t cleaned every morning. I've seen nicer B&B’s on 4 in a bed at half the price! It’s disgraceful they can get away with it! 
-4;Very disappointing to say the least. Everywhere very tired and in need of updating, some of the staff were rude, trying to get a drink and a midday snack was impossible and went elsewhere. The food in the restaurant was fine and it is in a lovely location and that,s where it ends, this is the worst Hotel we have stayed in . We paid for 5* accommodation and have stayed in better 2* definitely not upto standard
-4; Three words to describe our evening!  Overpriced, rude, twee. We won't be going again!  When we arrived the barman wanted to argue about the beer. Obviously wanted us to leave our table as soon as we had finished our meal,so that they could lay up for breakfast. The final insult was, the head waiter brought us the bill while were having coffee and waited with the card machine for us to pay! Didn't give us time to look at the bill! Even though we gave polite hints. It all came clear though, he wanted to go home!  It was ten o'clock! Never again!!! 
-4; Being vegetarian and paying £32.95 for a Christmas party menu I had high hopes. Silly me firstly the staff apparently forgot there were 2 veggies in the party but managed to throw together mixed salad leaves under a sliced pickled beetroot hm. Couscous for a main dish and baked apple for pudding. Very very poor menu and certainly not value for money. To top it off cash only bar. Don't know what the hotel is like for guests staying over but if you want somewhere nice to eat, walk down to the Oxford street area. 
-4; Rooms are very small and less than I would expect for the price. The amenities are not great and the internet service was patchy during the stay. It is close to Euston Station and Russell Square Tube Station. 
-4;i tried to book this hotel as we are going to a wedding at a venue opposite. i went through the online booking process which told me there was a king sized room available for my date as bed and breakfast, the booking then froze and therefore i called the hotel to check if they had received the booking or if i needed to book in over the phone. i was then told there was only a room for dinner bed and breakfast at £70 more than the bed and breakfast, i said but i don't want dinner as i am at a wedding over the road. I was told they only had dinner bed and breakfast. The lady i spoke to seemed to have no idea what was going on.very short sighted i think.
-4;Having been born and lived in Guildford for a number of years I was led to believe that the Angel was a high quality hotel. Sadly, no more. We booked to stay for 1 night on the 18th August in a deluxe twin room and it was a very hot day. The room was uncomfortably hot, had scaffolding outside the windows and the room was very dirty - in fact when my wife opened the windows she could see the sills were extremely dirty an an occasional table in front of the window was also dirty. She proceeded to wipe both the table and the windowsills and the paper came away black! The headboard was very dusty and needed a good clean, the shower was a hand held attachment and the bath wall surround of wood needed redecorating, The wooden surround of the handbasin was badly chipped, the toilet roll holder didn't fit and kept falling off and the wallpaper in one place was all torn. The carpet on the top step of the staircase was threadbare. We decided to cut our losses and return home without staying the night even though we paid £109.
-4; i have stayed in many hotels in my time and i can honestly say this is the worst place i have ever stayed. Me and my partner found this deal on last minute on group on for valentines day, we had completely forgot it was valentines so booked the this deal the night before. On arrival the staff member on reception asks firstly ' have you drove into the car park, as you can receive a fine' instead of welcoming us. We then went down for dinner in the evening sat down and ordered a bottle of wine in which the waitress demanded to see are ID which was incredibly embarrassing in front of the whole restaurant. My partner was made to go all the way back to the room to collect our passports. The same waitress then dropped a tray and instead of picking it up walked off in a big 'huff' then come back 5 minutes later to pick it up. After waiting 35 minutes for our main, my partners lamb come Rare and he asked for it well done. By this time we had to leave our food as we was due to meet friends for drinks. The room had 2 broken lights, the metal handles in the bath was dripping with rust, which made me not be able to simply relax on my weekend away and have a bath.  My partner went down stairs and asked the two gentleman on reception for ideas on 'quite, swanky, sophisticated' bars in the area to take me for some quite drinks. The two staff members recommended a place, so we got a taxi costing £20 there only to arrive and see it was a booming run down student night club, leading us to have to order a taxi straight home.  i have honestly never been so disappointed with a hotel and the staff members. I would avoid at all costs. 
-4;"After an excellent stay with the hotel when it first opened, my boyfriend and I decided to book another one night stay on the 26th october, after seeing the 'Feel Good Friday' deal on the Double Tree's website, (Dinner, Bed & Breakfast & Cocktail for 2 for £140)   We arrived in the evening and were dissapointed to see a 'CAR PARK FULL' sign as soon as we got there, we then temporarily had to pull up in the way of other cars trying to also get in the car park, while we quickly went in to reception to see where to park.  We were met by a gentleman on reception who told us that the hotel had been 'trying to contact' us all afternoon, to inform us that the restaurant was full so we were unable to reserve a table for dinner. We told the receptionist that we had made our dinner reservations earlier in the week, he then said he would 'look into it' while handing us a voucher for Lucy Tower Car Park, a Multi Storey car park further down the waterfront. We then drove to the Multi Storey and parked up, to discover that this 'voucher' still required us to pay £2, and ran out at 10am the next morning, so we would have to return before check out; to top up the car.   After parking up we made our way back down the Waterfront in the freezing cold, with all of our luggage. When we returned to the reception desk we were told the problem with our dinner reservation had been rectified, and we made our way to the room. The Room itself was lovely, with excellent facilities, although the view of the car park (which we weren't even parked in) was much to be desired.  After getting changed we made our way down the restaurant and presented the waiter with our  dinner vouchers, and ordered a drink each. When the waiter brought the dinner menu's to our table, we were confused as to why our 'Dinner' voucher, entitled us to a choice between a grand total of 2 starters, 2 main courses, and 1 dessert. When the waiter came to take our orders, we explained that neither of us liked either of the options for a main course (Venison or Fish Pie) He then suggested we order from the A La Carte Menu - but would have to pay extra. We didn't deem this acceptable on top of the £140 we had already paid, so left the restaurant and attempted to find somewhere else to eat in Lincoln at 9:00, with no booking. We returned from our meal at another restaurant, and decided to use our Cocktail vouchers in the Electric Bar, After a seat finally became available, we sat down and ordered a Cocktail each; we then waited 15 minutes before a waitress noticed we were still drinkless, and came over to ask what we had ordered. She then came back 10 minutes later with our drinks and apologised for our wait, explaining that the Barman had 'Forgot' to make our drinks. This just about topped off the night.  Unfortunately, due to having to rush our breakfast, pay our bill, and return to the car before the car parking voucher ran out at 10am, we were left with little time to discuss any of these issues with the Reception Staff. My advice to anyone wishing to stay at this hotel, is to reconsider the amount of money you are spending - and go elsewhere."
-4; We have visited this hotel in October for my birthday .. On arrival place looked OK and peaceful ... Rooms nice small but ok. Our bathroom above kitchen and stank like a deep fat fryer ... The place turns into a night club in the evening and you can't sleep from the noise and constant thud of bass and the music is so loud. Drunk kids all about ... Terrible can't believe it. We came here to relax .. Asked for twin room given a double ! Going to be so tired in the morning going to ruin the day !!! Thanks molesworth arms never will return and will tell everyone possible not to come here either.              around 
-4; We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The location is very central, opposite bars that serve £2 drinks all night, so it is quite a busy and popular neighbourhood especially for Friday and Saturday nights. Many people choose this hotel for exactly this reason but the paper thin walls of the rooms mean you can wake up at any point during the night or early morning. Needless to say we didn't sleep well and was an overall frustrating experience. 
-4; Paid for a room and breakfast. When we turned up for breakfast we were told that we were staying in an executive room and that breakfast was served in the executive lounge. Had we been told this we would have used the executive lounge on arrival. Paid £14 EACH for a BASIC continental breakfast. Two lifts were also out of action meaning that when a lift appeared it was already full. Will return to using the Hilton at South terminal. 
-4;" We stayed at the Park Plaza Leeds a few weeks ago. We chose this hotel as we were using my boyfriend's Club Carlson points and he had a preference for this brand going by previous experiences. We had to check in late (10pm) as we had been driving all day so wanted to get things sorted as quickly as possible. The staff on check in were very herlpful and speedy. Once we got to our room we quickly changed to head out for a late dinner when we finally noticed that the A/C was on full blast, with no way of switching it off. An error message was showing on the panel and we reported this to the front desk on our way to dinner. We were told this was a fault they couldn't fix immediately so we would need to move rooms. We agreed and told them to have it organised by the time we got back.  On our arrival back (around 11:30pm) we had to explain the situation again to the new person on the front desk. It took 5-10 minutes for him to do the paperwork, something I thought should have been taken care of in our absence given how late it was and the time we would have to waste moving rooms. After finally relocating to another floor we thought we were set..... until we tried to turn on the tv/try out the hair dryer/charge our phones. The room had no power. We had to get the front desk up to our room again, who upon checking the fuses found the switch had been tripped for our room. He reset it and we were fine, until we plugged our phones into the wall and it switched the fuse yet again. We were far too tired (by this time it was around Midnight) to move again so didn't bother taking them up on their offer. We were also offered a drink from room service on the house.... but after placing an order were phoned back 5 minutes later to be told they didn't have that drink in stock!  During our morning showers we discovered the glass door on the shower/bath was broken and ended up with water all over the bathroom floor. Luckily we weren't staying another night so packed up our things and left as soon as we could.  I'd also mention that both rooms we were offered were &quot;Executive&quot; rooms. They were both tired and dated with big clunky televisions that didn't have great reception and big, horribly patterned couches. We dread to imagine what a standard room would look like.  Upon checkout we were refunded the breakfast charge and were told we would recieve our Club Carlson points back and would be contacted by the General Manager with regards to this. 3 weeks later and we have not heard a peep, nor received any points back. The GM's personal assistant wrote to us (only after we filled in a survey - unsatisfactory points all round) and said she would get back to us with regards to the points refund but have not heard from either of them since. "
-4; It was a horrible hotel not worth the money at all! When we got there the place stunk of paint where they are try to redecorate so it just looked a mess the second we got there. Then the bathroom in our room stunk of damp. The room was boiling hot and couldn't open the window. Then when we finally got into bed an wanted to watch TV the remote didn't work properly. Get to sleep and at midnight an alarm went off waking us up. For the rest of the night all we could hear were floor boards creaking and people talking. Quite early in the day the maid started going round knocking on doors to clean the rooms so all we could hear was constant knocking. The noise outside was loud but expected not like the noises from inside the hotel. Then it took 45 minutes to get our breakfast in the morning even though all we had was toast! 
-4; As I stated in the title, 5 weeks ago I was told by the emergency consultant to say goodbye to my family as he wasn't sure I would make it through the emergency operation as I was almost at deaths door. Well, thankfully I made it back form the dark side but 2 weeks later I was due to stay at this hotel, my husband rang the hotel and sent the proof from the hospital of my emergency operation and he asked if they would allow us to move the date as I had 44 clamps holding my stomach together at that time. They said they would but we had to clear it with olotel who we booked with. We rang Olotel and explained to them and sent the proof they said they'd get back to us which they did and said the hotel refused to do anything to help even moving the date or giving a discount towards a room in the future, they were very apologetic but said the Marriott were adamant they would not help in any way! I can't believe such a prestigious brand would behave in such a mean, uncaring way. I fully intend to take this further now that I am 5 weeks post op and minus a spleen but with an attitude that I never had before! I have lost out on my overnight stay in London, tickets to The Rock of Ages and if that wasn't enough I had to forfeit my tickets to see Michael BUble at the O2! It's lucky ,y near death experience has taught me to cherish life and to know that Karma come to all, so the mean attitude displayed towards my situation by the Marriott will have cosmic consequences :) The moral of this review is don't almost die and expect this prestigious brand to give a damn! Thanks for nothing Marriott! 
-4; This is by far the worst hotel i've ever stayed in, i stayed in nicer cheap hostel rooms in Asia and South America. The room was tiny, we literally could not open our small (hand luggage size) case on the floor as there was not enough space. The bathroom was dirty, including was appeared to be dried blood stains on the back of the bathroom door. Seriously outdated decor, the whole hotel needs some serious attention.  We only stayed one night fortunately afetr a friends wedding. The breakfast was mediocre btu certainly nothing spectacular. On checkkout we complained about the dirty conditions and we given a 50% reduction in price, however, i would still certainly never stay there again or recommend it to anyone else. 
-4; the food at this hotel was terrible the the service was rushed and they also tried to serve us some other tables food and to top it all they served my wife with with wrong meal and then dealt with by a young girl with a cheesey grin that say yes i know . and suggested we have the same meals again we booked out and left early the next morning on a break that should have been 3 days we were there for for just over ten hours and that was to long in establishment 
-4; We arrived at this hotel and we were both pleased with what we found. The outside looked really really nice. We looked to park and found the hotel charged £50 for an overnight stay to park our car. So we used the ncp car park for a tenner for 24 hours. We were greeted by a staff member who was very nice and given are room keys. On entering our room the bathrooms are very nice but the rooms are very very basic and old including the bedding. I was awake half the night because the windows are so old and knackered they constantly rattle and bang. I mentioned this to the night porter who said it is quite noisey at night. But failed to help our situation at 5am and no sleep. Then we went for breakfast the staff were stood over us and clearing our table before we had finished our food. which i found a bit annoying. After this my girlfriend was getting dressed and our door opened for a housekeeper to be escorting a repair man into the room to measure up for new curtains. despite the fact she had knocked 5 mins previous and i went to the door and spoke to her and said we wouldnt require house keeping cause we would be checking out in an hour. Now i ignored the reviews and wish i had listened. The exterior is amazing, but the hotel and how its run is like faulty towers for a 4 star hotel it makes me very concerned on what level this is judged cause this is barely a one star. the service u get at a premier inn is 1000 times better than this. The price of the food are also terrible it was £12 for a sandwich and £6 for two coffees! BE WARNED STAY AWAY!!!!!! 
-4; I highly reccomend you think twice before you book a Spa Day or any treatments at The Grosvenor Pulford. Especially if you ever think you might fall ill within 48 hours of your bookings. (Let's face it, that's when most illness occur!)  This happened to myself and my friend. We phoned the Grosvenor Pulford to try and rearrange our Spa Day the night before when my friend was sent home from work, she even had a doctors note to confirm this. We were advised I would have to try and 'bring someone else'. I asked to speak to a manager but was unable to do so. I was also told it was '7 minutes after her working hours'. I was informed she would try and speak with her manager and call me in the morning.   I had a phone call in the morning saying she still hadn't spoken to her. I had already emailed the spa the previous night confirming that I wasn't bringing anyone else, but they hadn't checked there emails (they are terrible at replying) She also informed me it was unlikely I was going to get any of my money back.  £180! I wasn't made aware of their policy whilst booking. Just that a full payment was needed to secure the booking. I wasn't told that it was non refundable. So please please be careful when booking with these rude, non co operative company! 
-4; We have just returned after spending the weekend @ this dump. The public toilets stink. The bed is uncomfortable with a bottom sheet that didn't fit the mattress. The food was shocking. The bar service was so slow. Clearing up of tables was slow when eating and drinking. The main place for entertainment was the skyline was discustingly dirty. My advice is don't waste your money and stay here. I will say the entertainment for the kids is good, even so it's not worth the stay. With all the money butlins earn my advise is spend some money on these points. We won't be returning. 
-4; Called in for a light lunch today nobody welcomed us the man at the desk just said yes !! and that was our welcome we ordered tea and coffee to start then looked at the menu we placed our order he came in and shouted across to get our attention to go and sit at a table when the lunch arrived it was on a piece of slate ( why not a proper plate !!!) it stated on the menu wholegrain bread it came on white with two extra pieces also on the slate, the meal came with chunky chips which were dry, I suggest the dressing for the salad be put in a separate jug as not everybody likes the salad drowned with dressing !! overall the meal was poor and the service and staffs attitude was terrible wont recommend at all ever !!! staff need to be trained to greet customers better !! don't use roofing material use proper dinner plates food taste better off a plate than off the roof !!!! 
-4;" Was my daughters comments after I had just taken a tumble in front of the reception area whilst carrying my daughter who had asked to go to the loo!  An accumulation of what I can only describe as the final straw....  I had decided to take my daughters to visit Worburn Safari as a bank holiday treat. I also decided to book an overnight stay at a hotel. We are loyal Hilton customers so it was a no brainer which hotel chain we would stay in. The only choice was Double Tree versus Timbold Drive. I chose Timbold drive because it seemed more family friendly especially with a pool...  The reviews for this hotel were lacklustre - but I have never been one to go by reviews, preferring to experience for myself. On this occasion I wish I had taken note...  Checking in was fairly painless, the nightmare began when we walked into our bedroom...the smell! Not one to complain especially when I am with the kids so as not to spoil their experience, I whipped out my perfume, at least that made the smell bearable.  We decided to go swimming. The changing room cabinets were filthy but I reasoned that thus must be because they had not had the chance to clean them that they. The pool was very small - there were 7 of us in and that felt crowded. My young daughter refused to stay in because she felt the water &quot;smelt funny&quot; (it did) so we moved to the jacuzzi which was no better.   After about 20 mins we returned to the bedroom which was when I realised how really dirty the room was! See the pics and judge for yourself. Stains on the sheets, holes in the sheets, stains on the curtains, hair all over the bathroom, toothpaste stains still on the sink, dirt round the taps. I could go on! I doubt bud bathroom had ever had a thorough clean!  Still persevered! I know - but I really hate making a fuss and I reasoned again that we were there for only one night! I ordered our meals which took over an hour to arrive! The kids were starving at that point but what really pushed me over was the food which was cold and worse bland!  At this point I made a complaint. The Hilton has a policy of making things right if you complain and since our arrival I had seen several signs promoting this policy and I now understood why! It is as if they expect you to make a complaint!  I could go on but let the pictures speak for themselves! Also I am still nursing a sore knee from my earlier fall (I am writing this review from the hotel room)  If you need a hotel to stay in when you are in MK try Double Tree or even the Premier Inn! Anywhere but here!  One redeeming factor is the staff - Elvira the duty manager was quick to make things offering us our room rate back. But apart from that.... "
-4; I have stayed in many hotels and have never had the experience that I had here. I was put in a room right next to busy room, I asked to move and was then put in a room that was unbelievably cramped. The bathroom was very basis and quite dirty. I returned back to the room on my second evening and found that the dirty, wet towels from that morning had been folded and put back on the towel rail (even thought I put them all in the bath as instructed...this means they need washing). I called the reception over about 2 hours and no response. The basin and toilet hadn't been cleaned and bin not emptied. Grim place and would never stay there again. 
-4; Hi Shaun,  We are still waiting for our dinner after an hour with three young children, horrific service, if you'd like to come and speak to us we are in the restaurant, waiting, whilst watching everyone who came here after us eat their food... Apparently we're a large group of 7... In a conference hotel..., 
-4;" How I wish I had read these trip Advisor comments before my husband had booked this hotel! This was a trip away for our 4th wedding anniversary, child care was sorted and we were looking forward to a night away to celebrate.   We waiting 30 minutes to check in, no apology nothing, in the end my husband just walked up to the front desk infront of a check in lady and waited for her to finish her call. I already wasn't impressed about the long wait to check in.   We were given room 1418. The room was warm, nicely lit and had chocolates on the side, I was back in a happy place. As we had dinner reservations that night I jumped in the bath to start and get ready. I noticed a big pool of toilet water on the floor, Great the toilet was leaking. We rang reception and spoke to Julia who originally checked us in- a receptionist soon came up with an new room card and we moved rooms to 1509, again promised great views over the city... We walked into this room and we're gobsmacked at what faced us. The room was dark, cold and clearly was an emergency spare room in the hotel.   There was a glass bottle on the floor, a ball of blonde hair on the carpet in front of us. No chocolates, no heating, no mood lighting nothing! My husband put our bags down and noticed that the bed sides were covered in dust. We rang down to reception and spoke to Julia who promised to send house keeping straight away. I began to unpack and went to hang my dress up, in the wardrobe a dirty used tissue and dirty glasses greeted me. Again back on the phone to Julia who promised that house keeping were definitely on there way. We waited, we waited and eventually had to get ready and leave. We went upstairs for a cocktail with our complimentary cocktail vouchers.  We first went into the residents lounge...wow!!! It was like people had never drank before. There was no chairs, glasses and bottles everywhere...no staff anywhere, it was a disgrace!   We then walked round to the cloud 23 section. Immediately a waitress came over and told us we couldn't sit down and we had to make a reservation, go back down stairs and que. what's the point of the hotel giving us complimentary cocktail vouchers if you can't use them? They eventually let us stay and took our cocktail vouchers off us- then presented us with a ready made cocktail. No choice, no explanation of what it is nothing! Good job we don't have any allergies!   We then left the cloud 23 and went out for our meal. On the way out we passed reception and saw Julia and told her about our experience so far and that after waiting 45 minutes no one came to our room to clean, nor management to inspect the issues.  We returned some 5 hours later from our night out to find that our room hadn't been cleaned, the Hair, the tissues, the glass was still in the room.   My husband rang reception to complain for the 5th time...house keeping arrived at 11:45pm to Hoover!!!!  It was then that our sleepless night started...little did we know our room was next to the elevator shaft..we heard the lift go up and down...at 2am a corridor party started... at 3am a couple next door decided to start &quot;banging&quot; there head board very loudly for 2 hours...que zero sleep...3 calls to reception and no answer from anyone.   We went to reception to speak to the General Manager who we were told was not in. The duty manager met us and unfortunately was not very understanding at all, he wasn't really bothered that it was Our wedding anniversary, nor that we experience these issues. He did however suggest that if we came back to the hotel and PAID for a room he would give us a complimentary upgrade worth £40. I wanted to laugh in his face.   He then said we had to pay something for the room and suggested £60...he told us he didn't have the authority to give us the room for free!!! I was floored! I can't believe we have had to pay for a hotel room which was filthy, shocking staff and zero sleep!   Manchester has far better hotels than this &quot;has been&quot; hotel.   Save yourself the stress and lack of sleep and stay somewhere else!!!!!!!   Hilton you should be ashamed of yourself! "
-4;" Never give negative feedback, would rather say nothing if we don't have anything positive to say but feel so strongly about the dreadful experience we had at this hotel that its only fair to warn other travellers: First, the positives, good price for very basic rooms, but it was all that we expected for a one night stay prior to our two weeks in Mexico. Problems started upon our return: brakes had seized on our car from standing for two weeks (not the hotels fault, obviously). However, instead of jacking the car up and trying to free the brakes (or even just leave it in situ until we returned), they decided to DRIVE the car for a considerable distance over their very rough &quot;car park&quot; (just a piece of rough ground with uneven surface and packed with old bricks and flint stones) with the brakes seized ON(!), thus grinding out a huge amount of tread on one of our brand new tyres !! In their WISDOM(!) they also tried smashing the alloys with a metal hammer; again causing huge damage to the wheel! We tried to speak to someone about this and asked why they didn't leave the car where it was and they just said &quot;we had to move it and you hadn't given us permission to call the AA(!)&quot; (Not sure how we would could have given permission, being 8000 miles away in another country - oh wait, they could have called us as they had our mobile number but they obviously didn't think it was necessary!) We then asked to speak to the Manager but the non-British National employee strangely seemed to lose their basic understanding of the English language and was unable to understand what we were requesting!? All they kept saying was that it was our own fault and responsibility (Not sure how we could be held responsible for what could amount to criminal damage to our alloy wheels, but there you go !!) We got absolutely no assistance or understanding from the staff and needless to say the Manager didn't bother getting in touch with us to discuss our concerns. Having read some of the other reviews we can see that this is not a one off incident; so, if you value your car, we would urge you to find somewhere else to stay and leave your car! "
-4; It does the job but is overpriced for what it is. When we arrived a miserable receptionist greeted us and when asked if we wanted a tabe in the resturant and when we explained we had already eaten, got an almost grunt from her. Then a lovely man (the only positive of this hotel) helped us take our bags up to our room, which was the worst room I have ever stayed in. it was essentially a tiny lost conversion with a double bed and two singles. It was clean enough but with the sloping ceilings and both single beds underneath them, it meant 3 out of 4 of us banged our heads. When we had returned from our holiday we waited where we was told we would be picked up from. When no one was there we rang the hotel and they said they would be 10/15 minutes, agan after 30 minutes we rang and they said they had already been and we weren't there!! This was a lie as we had been standing waiting and had not moved from that spot. We ended up waiting 45 minutes for the minibus to arrive and when it did we was told their were other people in front of us and would have to wait longer as we were the last ones to ring!!! Even though one of the famillies had only been waiting 5 minutes. After we had very unhappily explained how long we had waited we was taken back to the hotel and to our car. I would highly recommend you do NOT use this hotel. I am sure you can get a much better hotel and service for the same price. 
-4; I booked a room for my employer for 3 nights over the Horse of the Year Show which came to £953 not cheap, the whole amount was taken from her bank the next day, she fell ill and could not attend so the booking was cancelled on the 26th September, to which I have been told that we will get no refund as it is a Pre Paid booking!! A deposit taken I can understand but not the whole amount. Not good practice! 
-4; I have just returned from a disappointing Christmas party. Organised to get a group of friends together before Christmas it was very disappointing. Considering the cost of £40 per head the meal was distinctly average. Mushroom soup, followed by chicken with 2 sprouts, 2 carrots, 3 potatoes, 1 parsnip & stuffing with Christmas pudding to follow. Followed by coffee and mini mince pies! Our group purchased the wine pack with very poor wines & when we bought different wine afterwards, supposedly a Sauvignon Blanc @ £22 per bottle, & that was one of the cheaper options, it had a distinctly Chardonnay like taste. The disco was too loud, with old music and quickly cleared the room. We left early, as couldn't see any point in waiting until the end. This all proved embarrassing for our friend who organised the event. This has left me with the feeling of being ripped off with cheap food and wine and a wasted evening when we looked forward to so much more. 
-4; 4 of us booked rooms & all 4 of us appalled at the terrible food/service breakfast & rooms! evening meal was so bad 2 of us where on loo most of the night, other people we made friends with there had the same problems, breakfast was a joke, toast on fire everything cold, no hot water for tea, orange juice empty....i was over charged by a lot & they still won't refund me?? not even a sorry by the so called MD tom. DONE STAY THERE! 
-4; Several months ago we completed an online booking to be able to send my partners parents away to celebrate their anniversary. No payment was taken, after unanswered phone calls and emails we decided to take the booking elsewhere. Peculiarly yesterday we received an email to say the room was reserved, and that no payment had been made. My partner sent an email to explain, the response from the hotel was 'we will cancel the booking' no apology given. The website and the reviews on tripadvisor does give positive feedback and this was the reason for the booking, unfortunately poor communication led to no booking. 
-4;"I'm not one to complain but after having our wedding at Aztec west in April this year I want to warn others who maybe considering doing the same. This is a very poorly run hotel, this is a brief insight into the service we were given on what should have been our special day.   It began with our toastmaster Alex he was part of the &quot;wedding package&quot; we had with hotel. I was asked by Alex prior to event to get to venue for 4.15 although he new ceremony was due to start at 4.30. I've never been married before so arrived at this time but was mortified When guest were still stood outside so therefore saw me pull up, he new i was coming at this time as he asked me to so should have had a member of staff waiting at gates to let my driver no they were not ready for me yet. That situation i found myself in could have been avoided. I have since been told by guest he never organised guest to be seated our family & friends did. He disappeared for 3 hours after ceremony so no communication with my photographer as he was nowhere to be seen.We weren't introduced into room. No announcement for cake cutting, speeches were introduced by themselves. We were told there's a 24 hour bar once wedding room closed - the shutters were down to this bar. Our honeymoon suite was poor,Guest had Better rooms in the lodge. Next day £15 for a stone cold breakfast,dirty high chairs & broken table.  We've also had problems since the event our chair hire company went to pick her covers up, to be stood around for an hour as no one at hotel new there where about's. A few days later they were found so she went again to pick them up to find several pieces missing. As stated this is a brief insight i Have complained to Chris Hill general manager & his words were &quot;he's satisfied his staff have fulfilled our requirements&quot; When clearly from the above they haven't. So took our complaint higher to Antony Spencer the managing director & he also agrees with Chris this is how guest should be treated they couldn't care less. We had 170 guest at our wedding so gave this hotel plenty of business. To be offered an over night stay as a gesture of goodwill is not exceptable.  So please please please think twice about booking this unorganised venue for your wedding,don't have what should be your most special day ruined by a hotels lack of professionalism & organisation.  Regards  Katie"
-4; After a day's walking, we arrived at the hotel late afternoon wanting some tea. Initially my friend went to the bar to order and was then told to go to the reception desk. At the reception desk she was told to go back to the bar to order!! The staff were then overheard to be arguing about the correct place to order tea.  The dog was not allowed into the hotel, but dogs belonging to customers who are staying the night are?!  When the tea arrived we had one pot of water for 9 cups of tea and not a biscuit in sight. The price was extortionate considering what we actually had......  All of us felt very up welcomed by both the staff and snooty other customers. 
-4; We visited the hotel as a birthday treat in August 2015 and we terribly disappointed with the hotel and service provided. When we arrived we were pleased with the overall look of the hotel. We arrived at check in time and on arrival at reception the receptionist who was whispering because there was a wedding in the room directly off the hotel entrance said that the room was not ready because they have a wedding so therefore are really busy. In my opinion hotels which also do weddings should be able to cope with the demand from the wedding and hotel guests. We sat in the bar and was told the room would be ready soon and they will come and get us when it was ready. After an hour passed we went back to the reception to ask and was told it was still not ready. This time we were offered a free drink voucher to get a drink at the bar. At this point I felt this was good service and compensation for our room not being ready. When we went to the bar there was no one to be seen and all of the drinks for the wedding reception were left on the bar unattended for at least ten minutes. After ten minutes we went back to the reception to ask if someone could serve us. After another 5 minutes someone finally came to serve us. After another half hour we finally went to our room. The receptionist checked us in and sent us to our room. On arrival to our room the cleaners were still cleaning it and said it would not be ready for ten minutes. At this point we were so fed up we stood in the hallway for over ten minutes waiting for them to clean the room. The room was comfortable and clean when we finally got in there. We had a lovely evening away from the hotel and returned about 10pm. We went back to the room and put the TV and lights on the and lights blew making a very loud pop. After complaining to reception someone came to have a look. The hotel manager was trying to put the electric back on at the switch board and the light next to the bed was sparking. We wasted about 2 hours trying to fix the problem which couldn't be fixed. As soon as he put the lights back on at the switch board they would spark and go off again. During this time we asked if we could move rooms as we would have to go all night without any lights. We were told they were full so we could not move. When we asked if we could have a refund if we left now we were told possibly but he wasn't sure. In the end we came to the compromise that we would have 1 night free and pay for the second night when we were in a suitable room where all the facilities will be working properly. However, this was something I had to suggest not something that was offered.vWe were also offered free breakfast as compensation. That night the lights went on and off all night. The next day we were told that by the time we came back from our day out our bags would be moved to our new room where all the facilities would be working. When we arrived back to the hotel the next day we were given a new room key. When we got to the room surprise, surprise none of our belongings were in the room. We had to go back to the reception ask for our old room key to collect our things then take the key back to the reception. Overall it was terrible service and I will definitely not be staying here again or at any Mecure hotel. 
-4;I would have said a good hotel but the shambles of charges going onto my card after we had checked out for services that we didnt take was shocking. Getting it resolved is like pulling teeth and they make you feel like you are lying when you explain that 5 members of the family stayed, why would only one have taken breakfast, for example. Deposits .....you should have used a credit card! Watch your bank statements is my advise!!
-4; 568.00 for 2 nights in a 4star rabbit hutch....I will never stay again . I honestly thought a mistake had been made when I entered the tiny tiny bedroom, turned left into the smallest bathroom which stank of urine every time I switched the shower on of which had less power of my own peeing ability. Never never again.... 8 tables to choose from for breakfast ...7 filled with dirt dishes food on floor serving area filthy I coul go on and on but I am too upset and need to save myself for the email of complaint I need to write to head office now!!!!!! 
-4; Stayed here overnight whilst on visit work / leisure , persuaded my friends to cancel their reservation at the thistle as I am a Radisson fan and have posted several excellent reviews for other Radisson hotels.  What a mistake ! whilst the room was clean and comfortable the noise level is terrible, not the hotels fault, it is central London but where other city locations have glazed windows none here,light sleepers might want to consider this.   After a disturbed night sleep I got a text on Sunday morning at 7am telling me about online check out that woke me up !!   On arrival at 3:30pm room was not ready to check in to, had to check in when we got back from theatre , slow service again, breakfast chaos, nothing replenished food cold, waiting staff useless and abrupt asked had I had a good stay I was told well look at the number of people we have staying , we are fully booked, the hotel was fully booked three days before arrival surely provision for extra staff should have been made given the advance warning. Paid above average prices for something no better than a premier Inn.  As a Club Carlson sliver elite member i am quickly falling out of love with Radisson !!!   Don't bother adding breakfast it's just next door to McDonald's and several other nice establishments. 
-4; I booked to stay in Mercure for a special weekend and it was the biggest let down. The room was nothing like the website suggested. Walking in i was shocked the double bed was pushed against a wall and there was just enough room to walk down the side of it. There was then a tiny ensuite one person could fit in. The wall was dirty and had coffee drips down it, and we had a lovely view of a gutter from the window. I asked at reception if i could move rooms as the cleaner told me they were bigger on the other side of the building, but they brushed me off and didn't really care. The staff weren't helpful, and on an evening there was a drunken bride and her guests hanging out the front door having a fag.  Pretty much disgusted with the place. 
-4;As coming here for my birthday with my mother and sister was very disappointed, staff very rude. And very disgusted at lunch as all 3 of us were severed raw chicken! When telling the waiter he reply with il tell chef, and we never heard anything back! Rooms were average bedding was filthy! And at the end of our stay as we checked out they tryed to over charge us! Very disappointing!
-4; Thankfully i came onto trip advisor to check the reviews of the grand royal hyde park, as so many people had booked and had to be move to their not so nice sister hotel 3km away i decided to call reservations! After speaking to a member of staff i was told they could not grantee me a room even though they had a room available.  IT IS VERY TRUE WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING, ADVERTISING A NICE HOTEL BUT REMEMBER YOU WONT BE STAYING THERE!  ONE FOR WATCH DOG I THINK!!!!!!! 
-4; Won a spa day at the Cambridge Belfry hotel and spa, Camborne for two, and decided to treat my best friend who isn't on the top of the world at the moment, thinking a day of pampering was just what was needed. How wrong could I have been! The staff couldn't have been less helpful if they tried! A long spa day turned into a 45 minute very disappointing visit, without even a cup of coffee!! 
-4; Chalet was dirty, in bad state of repair and in my opinion not suitable for guests. Apart from placing clean towels eachday, this chalet was not serviced. It was dirty when I arrived and no cleaning was done while I was there. 
-4; We recently visited the Dukes Head on a groupon deal, £99 for a double room with afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast. My sister and her partner also bought the same groupon deal and we arranged to meet there. We were given a voucher when we arrived to get our cream tea although we didn’t have it as we thought we would not manage dinner if we did. My sister and her partner were not offered the voucher for their tea when they arrived.  We had paid an extra £10 to upgrade to a classic room, when we got to it we found it very small and not to a standard we are used to, we asked if there was a larger room to upgrade to and paid a further £20 to upgrade to a feature room. That had a king size bed and a much larger bathroom.  We went to the restaurant for dinner at 7.30pm, the waitress who showed us to our table was very young, clearly ill-experienced and did not have a very good grasp of English. After about 20 minutes we managed to order some wine, she brought Chilean Sauvignon Blanc instead of New Zealand. We tasted it and it was ok so we decided to drink it as that was easier than trying to explain as she didn’t understand. When we made the booking we checked that my sister’s partner would be able to have a burger in the restaurant (he is a bit fussy with food and doesn’t like sauces so a burger is the easiest option). We were assured that would be fine, we even phoned again three days before to check again and was assured it would not be a problem. The waitress informed us that the chef said he would not cook a burger. After some arguments it was agreed that would be possible. Eventually after an hour of waiting we managed to order some food. The restaurant had about three tables occupied at the time. I ordered a halloumi salad, my partner and my sister ordered beef carbonnade and her partner the burger. My sister asked what the seasonal vegetables were, the waitress pulled a face, guessed at carrots, we suggested she go and find out and come back, she did not come back so they did not get the opportunity to order vegetables. When my salad arrived it looked very nice but had no dressing so was very dry. I asked for olive oil, 10 minutes later none had arrived, my partner went in search of some, eventually a different waitress came to tell us they don’t have olive oil!!!! We complained and a senior member of staff offered us free desserts or a round of drinks on the house, well desserts were included in our deal so that was no use. We were eventually given two free bottles of wine. Desserts could not be faulted, the chocolate brownie was amazing.  We noticed the couple of the next table who were being served by the same waitress as us, they ordered a bottle of wine with a cork, she could not open it, the gentleman opened it himself.  We went up to our bedroom about 11.15pm, the noise from the music in the bar was so loud, there was no way we could be expected to sleep, it felt like there was a band in the room with us. My partner went back down to reception to find it closed. He went in search of a member of staff in the lobby, he came up to our room and agreed that it was not acceptable. He said he would ask them to turn it down. It didn’t go down at all but stopped shortly after midnight. We then managed to get to sleep.  The next morning we went for breakfast which was in the ballroom, there were signs pointing the way which led to a fire escape door which said do not enter. It transpired that we had to go through that door. Well what a shambles, there was no food ready, no plates to put food on, no glasses for juice. They had no peppermint tea. Luckily I had brought my own so got a pot of hot water. Finally glasses arrived so we could get juice. A further wait and hot food arrived and a few plates, which lasted about 5 seconds as so many people were waiting. We wish we hadn’t bothered, the scrambled eggs were sloppy, the sausages were half raw. There was no white bread to make toast, only brown, which was fine for me, but my sister’s partner wanted white. That did arrive eventually. The staff kept pointing out that they were really busy as they had a coach party in. Not our problem – get enough staff to cope with that.  When we checked out, the cost of the upgrade and the £10 parking had been removed, we had not asked for that but feel that was a fair result. All in all, a very disappointing weekend and we would not return. 
-4;Dire - I won't go back - see 'Title' for reasons why - also NO PARKING!!! The fire alarms went off at 130 AM and 245 AM. The stairwell was blocked with bicycles and other stuff. The radiators came on every 20 minutes and clunked and sounded like a car with a bad muffler. The make up mirror did not light up. The windows are thin and full of condensation so even though on the 5th floor I could hear everything on the street below. I did get a refund for half my room rate but I won't be going back - ever!
-4;" Sadly, I am using tripadvisor to complain about a cruel treatment I received from a concierge tonight. My name is Claudia and I'm a post graduate student living in London; went today very late tonight to visit my friend given his short stay in the city, as well as being the only gap in our schedules.  I do agree on the fact that policies are more strict after midnight, no discussion about it. However, what I experienced tonight let me absolutely speechless and crying, never in my life I've been so humiliated.   My friend, who was waiting for me did fall sleep so wasn't able to contact the receptionist to give the permission for me to go up, I was texting and calling but he was sleeping in no less than 3 minutes and after I said was going to call him, the concierge verbally attacked me asking me without manners or consideration about the fact that he hadn't contacted reception yet, I kindly asked him to give me 5 more minutes, I am a quiet person who never loses her temper and pointed out the fact that it wasn't the right way to treat a person, out of blue he said that he had the right as I was in 'his' hotel where he can do whatever he wanted, I firmly but politely said 'no' there are rights and manners to say things and he replied he will call security to force me to go out, obviously is the kind of person who is used to don't respect others' rights, I was not drunk nor rude not bad dressed and didn't even replied in any sort of aggressive way, I was more mortified, frightened and shocked about the idea of somebody using the force towards me. I am a petite girl and couldn't believe he was physically threaten me.  The receptionist on the other hand, was a well mannered person, who seemed uncomfortable with the embarrassing attitude of the concierge, he politely and nicely explained me that the hotel has a rule of not calling their hosts to the room after midnight and it wasn't either possible for me to wait in the lobby a possibility that at that point wasn't even considered it, I thanked him immediately and left, remarking that his way was the appropriate way to treat a person.  To summarise my frightened experience from a clearly bully man, I want to say that the hotel should be more conscious about their staff mainly because they are representing the hotel by being upfront, rude behaviour, exasperation and anything use to intimidated others shouldn't be used in any kind of way and should be considerate unacceptable. I understand everybody could have had a bad day but that is not even a reason to treat others badly, they should be careful especially if they have a customer service position, I should add that we all there were foreigners given our accents so at some point I asked myself if maybe that was an accepted way to treat others in his culture as a way to indulge him but then thought it couldn't be as I have seen people from many different cultures treating others politely therefore I encouraged myself to write this  I hope this bad experience can be read it by the manager whom I'll write after this with all my details as I do believe that this kind of experiences should not happen anywhere. Thank you for reading my review and thank you to the receptionist for being polite. "
-4;"I was given 4 days at Nidd Hall for my 50th birthday but was very disappointed with the hotel. I have a disability and requested 6 pillows for support when I'm in bed. I even rang and checked the day before to make sure they had noted my request. Needless to say no extra pillows where in the room when we arrived. I had to re-request them from house keeping. Our sign room bath had bits of dirt and even pubic hair in it, and was leaking. A man from maintenance had to come and fix it temporarily. Then a cleaner came to &quot;re-clean&quot; the bathroom. (we hadn't been there an hour yet.) after she left we went in to check it out and saw that the water holes in the shower head had black mould hanging all over them. Rather annoyed and very disappointed we went down and asked if a manager could come up to the room to see the mouldy shower head and to hear about our poor experiences so far. He was actually helpful and moved us into a &quot;historic&quot; suite. However the problems did not stop there in brief; there were painters all over the hotel with ladders blocking corridors, wet paint signs everywhere, even a pile of screws left on the floor of one corridor (lots of health and safety issues especially for the many wheel chairs and zimmer frames being used), a nasty strong smell of paint mixed with an excessive smell of chlorine on the corridor above the pool, no clean sheets at all during all our stay (even though I had spilt hot chocolate on the duvet cover on the second night), our ordered daily newspaper did not arrive, on checking out they had the wrong information about our room change and we where charged for things we didn't order or use,  Thank goodness for the beautiful and interesting attractions of Yorkshire that contributed to our wonderful days out. It is a real pity that we cant include Nidd Hall Hotel in that, although the grounds where lovely."
-4; Hotel is clean and tidy and with lovely features.  Just a shame the staff are deaf... either that or they are just the most inconsiderate humans to ever grace the Earth!   I booked the hotel for a nice break with my husband. We have a 2 1/2 year old child and more often than not he has me up 3-4 times in the night for various reasons and then arises at 5am to start the day. So, we were both looking forward to some sleep to be honest!   But no  I would have honestly been better staying at home and being woken up by my child 3-4 times by my son.  1am - door SLAMMING, staff talking loudly in the corridors, more slamming  2am More slamming  3am more slamming and a Chinese member of staff banging buckets on a wall (yes really)  (repeat in hourly intervals) 6am - Slamming and what sounded like some sort of mechanical robot walking around the corridors 7am member of staff loudly slamming door and wheeling laundry baskets down the hall whistling loudly - at this point I opened my door and shouted at him, he apologised and looked shocked that a guest was actually staying in a hotel  7.30am Indian member of staff loudly talking on his mobile phone, again I shouted at him- he carried on his conversation  Followed by a nice 8am knock at the door (check out was 11am)   So at this point we gave up attempting to get any sleep, both far too fuming to sleep anyway.  Spoke to the manager on check out, who wrote our complaint on a notepad - which really helped and made us feel valued .........NOT   Will definitely be taking this further   Paid £159 to be kept awake all night by the inconsiderate idiots that work here 
-4; My fiancée stopped for her hen party for a fire and ice treatment with overnight stay, this included a 3 course meal for a pre agreed price (payable on the night of £28) more on that later...  Be aware of them taking money out ur account without you knowing!!!!!!!!!  Here's her review..  When we arrived the rooms weren't ready, but we were a little early so we went for fire and ice treatment which to be fair was very good all very clean and modern, after that we went to check in our rooms but one wasn't ready even though it was guaranteed for 3 o clock... They wanted to move one of the party to another room even though we wanted to be all together or wait over an hour for the room!! So we had to wait longer with not much of an aploogy for this.. We were then told we had to pay 50 holding deposit per room which we were not pre advised about which could take up to 10 WORKING days to go back into our account,,  The meal was very good standard however when they brought the bill they had over charged and charged 32.50 a head instead of the 28 price.. When complained the waitress mumbled about computer glitch and changed the price but to me this seemed deliberate in an attempt to get more money without people noticing!!  No air con in rooms which for such a venue was quite shocking really  Breakfast was nice and we and the hens had a separate room for group bookings althought it seemed less choice than the main breakfast area  Now here's the best bit... When getting home I've checked my online bank and they have kindly taken a FURTHER £169 out my bank with NO AUTHORISATION from me about this.. When I rang and spoke to Sarah (who was lovely) they said sorry it must be a computer glitch (another one?? ) it's taken the room rate and another security deposit from one of your party's rooms... I said we'll did they not pay then.. She said oh yes they did pay their 50 and the room had been already paid in advance!!! So why take the money out my account???? The belfry can offer NO explanation as to why this has happened!! It's got to be refunded which could take another 10 working days... Which means I'll probably end up not having the money to pay all my bills and leave with bank fees!! Someone is allegedly going to call me back tomorrow...   I find to whole fiasco a disgrace for such a prestigious name!!!  BE AWARE!!! 
-4; I came to Manchester with my mum and stayed in this hotel everything look fancy but don't be deceived the food is terrible no much choices the flush of the toilette didn't work at all and no one was bothered to do anything about it . I'm sitting the the Resturant one hour now no one came to take my order the bar man busy watching a game can't wait to leave . 
-4;"I really have no idea how anyone has anything nice to say about this hotel. It's an absolute dump. The grounds are pretty and I liked the features, along with the soft bedding and mattress. However it stops right there. Upon booking this room through the website I was convinced that I had selected a double room - confirmation came through as twin. Asked at check in - no doubles were available, however the upgrade was conveniently available. I heard next door dragging items around, and upstairs - blatantly no doubles. I didn't sleep a wink - if it wasn't for suitcases being dragged up against the wall all night, chatting and phone calls through the paper thin walls, or the sheer inconsideration for others from other guests it could have been okay. I put the do not disturb sign on the door - only for the maid to walk in. The room was beyond tatty - faulty towers is it's new nickname. The restaurant was a joke - I ordered a &quot;fresh&quot; pizza. 40 mins later a rock hard thawed out pizza arrived. I can safely say that it was the most disgusting pizza that I have eaten, actually it was the worst meal, served in a pizza box. Hilarious. I wished it was a takeaway pizza from Pizza Hut. They didn't offer any condiments, just walked straight off, and I had to loiter outside the kitchen door until they had seen me to ask. Shower was pathetic - worse than rain water, water was nonexistent. I could go on - please save yourself £100 a night, this place was shocking."
-4;Our room was cancelled due to overbooking and we were informed two months after booking and one night before we were due to stay for my husband's 'Christmas do' and only discovered this when another of my husband's colleagues phoned to check the pillows she had requested were not forgotten. We booked for the sole reason the party was at Botley Park, after reading reviews we were already very reluctant but for convenience went ahead and reserved a room. We then had to make very hasty alternative arrangements, what dreadful treatment ! In all 12 rooms were overbooked, how can this happen ? We were offered a taxi to another hotel nearby, also with poor TripAdvisor ratings so we declined and were lucky enough to find a room at The Clarence Hotel in Southsea which was superb, ie everything you could possibly wish for if you are used to staying in luxurious hotels which are professionally run. Incidentally The Clarence Hotel certainly deserves it's high ratings, was excellent value for money with a wonderful English breakfast, providing the highest quality food without a buffet bar in sight with a lovely welcome and pristine bedrooms.  In the past we have found Macdonald hotels (Windsor, Bath, Stratford upon Avon, Marlow) to be good quality, however, Botley Park was overpriced, chaotic and should be avoided at all cost if you wish to be valued as a hotel guest. I wrote two letters regarding this situation and have still not had the courtesy of a reply - this speaks volumes !!! There is something seriously wrong when a hotel chain such as Macdonalds allows this to happen and fails to respond when challenged.
-4;I recently stayed at this hotel - and whilst the location was very convenient for the LG Arena we ended up getting totally stung by the carparking situation. We have never been here before so followed the signs for the hotels, then a clear sign which said 'Novotel Hotel only'. Passing through two barriers we ended up in the carpark which the hotel actually stands in and parked accordingly. It was dark, raining and we having travelled a long way were tired. The receptionist on check in mentioned nothing of the parking so we thought no more of it. The next morning however we were informed that we had parked in the 'Drop and Go' Car park and would now have to pay £100! There were signs we were told - and on inspection yes there are signs around the hotel entrance saying dont park in the so called 'Drop and Go' - however from this entrance there are no signs in the carpark itself saying that is the 'Drop and Go' - there are also no signs warning that an overnight stay will be £100 and more to the point why would the hotel have any signs up leading you to a carpark that you cant even park in? The receptionist admitted it happens all the time and sent us to discuss with NCP at the airport who would not help -they however do have a very well rehearsed procedure for this 'mistake' which would also imply that we are not the only ones who have ended up doing this. The hotel itself is ok but this situation was so badly handled that we will not be staying there again.
-4;We also booked (and pre-paid) the Grand Royale Hyde Park as we were attending the Hyde Park concert on 12th August and wanted to walk to & from the event. On arrival, we were informed that we had been upgraded - to a hotel 3 miles away! ...the Best Western in Kensington. We then had a stressful time moving to the other hotel, which meant we were late meeting up with friends. And instead of being able to walk from Hyde Park, we had a £20 taxi fare to return to the hotel after the event.  To add insult to injury, the best Western put us in the smallest room available, until we complained and got the Club Room as promised - still not the quality I would expect from a Club Room. Terrible customer service.
-4; We booked a twin non smoking room, the room they gave us was a double very tired smoking room. When we entered the room the phone rang and it was reception asking if we wanted to be moved? We said we did as the room wasn't what we booked, they gave us a key to another room, and on entering it, it was clear that it was being used, unclean, bed sheets everywhere etc, on complaining they offered us a junior suite, but this room was freezing! and consisted of a queen bed and a sofa bed, an engineer finally arrived but couldn't fix the heating, so we were finally given the room we originally booked, a twin non smoking. We decided to eat in the hotel as our evening had been ruined, although the food was lovely, once we were shown to our table we were ignored, and had to find a member of staff to serve us. The staff on reception were really polite, but we felt the problems we encountered were probably a regular occurrence. 
-4; We had dinner here. The food was quite shockingly awful. Bad compared to the very high prices charged, but also bad by any standards.  The service was pretty lousy too. 
-4; Came on what we thought would be a quiet Thursday afternoon. Too busy and we were nit asked if we had been before very little welcome package. No offer to show us around. Changing rooms are too small and when stepped out to pool side the floor was s Slippy. There were very few loungers or relaxing area around the pool and it was a bit like we had to wait for someone to leave before we could get a decent spot. Very disappointed when we left as we didn't even get a goodbye or thanks for coming or see you again. Rude! Fair as to say won't be returning again or recommending to friends & family. Definately needs staff improvements and a good clean up and revamp. 
-4;" Stayed here on business and was given a tiny dark room with a single bed. Furnishings - including the chintzy bed spread - sad, tired and certainly had seen better days. I think the check-in clerk sensed they were chancing their arm by stuffing this room up me as I received a phone call within minutes of setting down my luggage and standing agape at the state of the place. &quot;Just checking you're happy with the room Miss&quot; they said. To my eternal regret &quot;Er, yes...&quot; I said. Considering my company had made the booking and was footing the bill I wasn't entirely sure they hadn't REQUESTED a dark, dank single room for me. Turned out they hadn't. This cost top dollar rack rate. Suppose I wasn't the silver-haired, toffee-nosed Hyacinth Bucket type that they try so hard to court. The only thing worse than the room were my fellow guests. Snooty doesn't even begin to cover it. In short - avoid this place at all costs if you're under 60, not used to 'dressing for dinner' and don't delight in lording your supposed wealth over everyone else. All that said, BEAUTIFUL beach location - really stunning... and a gorgeously appointed dining room.  "
-4; A friend and I travelled from opposite ends of the country for our reunion pamper and stay at Oulton Hall. Both travelling 4 hours each!   From start to finish it was a shambles. We requested that our treatments were together and were told of course it was possible. We were asked to wait for our robes after sitting there for 40 minutes we realised we had been forgotten about so had to ask again for them. Finally after getting ready we returned to the spa reception for our appointment. We were not seen to until 15minutes into our treatment time, and that was only to complete consultation forms. Again we were forgotten about. Half an hour into our treatment I was collected and told we wouldn't be together as the spa was too busy. I had my gelish pedicure all be it rushed and I felt like the beauticians were all fighting over equipment. It was not enjoyable at all. I then found my friend in the relaxation room to be told they stopped her treatment half way through due to there being lack of qualified staff to complete her pedicure? She had to wait an extra half an hour therefore, we were split up again.  I spoke to a gentleman about this at the spa and he said it was just because so many people requested the same treatment? Surely they should have let us know this prior to booking?  On closer inspection of my gelish pedicure is by far the worst I've ever had. It's very messy with lumps in (looks like grains or sand under the polish), the nails aren't actually all painted only parts and they are not painted to the tips.  Later we checked into our room to find, a horrid smell from the bathroom drains when we started to get ready for the evening. This resulted in being moved rooms.   At dinner we were seated and asked if we'd like to see a wine list by the waiter who seated us we said yes please. We literally never seen him again. 15minutes later we had to ask another waiter for one.  We were moved to above the bin store so shortly before 8am we were woken up by the racket from below. Which continued for the best part of an hour.  On checking out we were asked to pay for things we had put on the room. We had paid for everything up front so it was impossible for there to be any. To which the receptionist said oh don't worry about it then this happens a lot. So if I hadn't of said anything I'd have been charged extra money?  I also informed the receptionist about how disappointed I was and she took my details and said she have the duty manage contact me. I've heard nothing.   My friend and I spent a lot of money, on what was supposed to be a luxury pamper and night stay at Oulton Hall. Unfortunately the picturesque setting didn't match up to the service provided from start to finish. We are both very disappointed and it's safe to say it ruined our annual reunion. 
-4; This is the 4th time I have stayed at the hotel - last time my review was 'perfect start to a holiday' - now it is 'worst start to a holiday'. The reception staff are lovely and smile throughout the moans and groans of customers. The room was disappointing - cracked wash basin and generally very tired. As for the food at Amys - it was so bad I had the entire cost of the meal refunded. If you see people arriving with Marks and Spencers food - it is because the food is so dreadful. The serving staff are also less than helpful. 
-4; Do not believe what you see on the website, it shows extremly spacious well furnished rooms. We booked a feature room at £230 a night we were shown to a pokey miserable room, it was so small they could not fit tea making facilities in it despite the website saying all rooms had this facility. I made it clear when booking that I had mobility problems and was assured that I would have no more than a couple of steps to negotiate . The room was up three fllights of stairs when I mentioned this the receptionist said nothing. We were asked to wait in reception while they tried to find an alternative room and were offered tea and coffee while we waited. The drinks arrived with a bill for £7.00!!!! No alternative room could be found and they made no effort to help us find a solution. We ended up coming home and spending hours on the M25 on a Friday night when we should have been enjoying our break. 
-4; Stale sandwiches with poor quality fillings. Cakes were also stale and the coffee lukewarm. Scones were actually quite good but the jam was tasteless and the cream was poor quality. We were not the only table complaining about the quality. Very disappointing as this was a birthday celebration for my daughter. 
-4; This stay advertised luxury and failed to deliver. The reception staff are poorly trained in hotel management and customer service. The rooms are dated, stained, broken and the beds are painful to sleep in. The location is great, although you can hear the bars, people and high street throughout the night.  We didn't eat there, or spend much time there because it was grim in general. 
-4;I am currently staying in this hotel. I've been here two hours and I can honestly say it's the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.   Never before have I complained because of the lack of cleanliness. The bathroom is filthy! There are hairs around the edge of the bath and grit in the tub. I wanted to freshen up after a long drive but would come out feeling dirtier.   I complained and was told someone will be up. I called again after 45 minutes as no one had arrived. He'd been sent to the wrong room!   When he did arrive, he ran the hose around edge, which I could have done myself! The hairs and grit are still there. He offered to send housekeeping up in the morning, at about 7:30. I'm here for business so will have left by then!   I'm going to check the company policy on switching hotels.   Also, there's only wifi on the ground floor, meaning I will not be able to catch up on work in the evening like I need to.   Will request this hotel is removed from our approved list.
-4; arrived at what looked like a stunning hotel and was very excited about my night away, opened the door and was greeted by the sound of a teenage girl arguing on the phone with her boyfriend shouting to tell her mother some one was here, she proceeded to shout while we waited 5/10mins alone in a hall way with no reception area, finally greeted by the lady of the house and shown to our room number 7 impressed by what we saw we left to meet family looking forward to returning later. upon returning i ran myself a bath which was luke warm with only running the hot tap and then got into bed which was awful the mattress was incredibly thin and lumpy and only 1 very flat pillow each, after an uncomfortable nights sleep i was looking forward to my shower which was hot and powerful for a few mins then some one else must of been running water as the temperature and pressure dropped. we had booked in for breakfast at 9am apparently you cant just go down when your ready and ordered a full english which appeared moments after, i new as soon as i saw it i would not enjoy it the sausage was vile and had no colour except pink the bacon was also pink and very fatty the egg was dripping in oil and plonked on top of the hash brown which absorbed said oil, the mushrooms and tomato are the only edible parts, the toast was cold and the tea had a strange metalic taste. we then decided to check out and no one was any where to be seen we eventually found the 'chef' in the kitchen and he took our payment in the bar area which apparently doubles up as the families lounge judging by all their belongings on the sofa and the group of teenagers running around with the lady of the house oblivious to the guests.  very disapointed and would never stay here again 
-4;I have visited Champneys Forest Mere on numerous occasions and have always come away fully relaxed and looking forward to booking my next trip. This time was the complete opposite. The staff were very dismissive and condescending (at times making me feel like I was bothering them and being a nuisance - I felt very uncomfortable asking anything of anyone). The refurbishment that is going on was not advised prior to me booking or at any point after I had booked. The construction work is extremely intrusive and certainly impacts on the whole guest experience. It is loud (very) and also encroaches on a number of the guest areas - pool, lounge/relaxation areas, changing rooms. There were things that were out of order or closed for maintenance - toilets, plunge pool etc. I was unable to book additional appointments during my stay - I do know that I should possibly/probably have booked these prior to my stay, but have never had to in the past - and although very annoying, it was the attitude of the spa booking/reception staff that made this a real problem. They did not attempt to help or offer any suggestions. At one point I asked if there was ANYTHING available to book and she just looked at me blankly and asked what I wanted to book specifically. I said that we had already gone through everything I was particularly interested in, so I was therefore open to suggestions, She just said she couldn't do anything, maybe try later. The food was good as usual, but I do get the impression they are trying to save money and cutting corners. My room was in the eves, disappointing, but not the end of the World. However, it was looking quite tired and well used. Finally, I had made a point of filling in a guest request form to highlight which inclusive treatments I would like, my robe and flip flop size, and that I would like a double bed. The only part of this that was done correctly was my flip flops!!! I also booked and paid for - prior to my visit - some Thalassotherapy, this wasn't on my itinerary when I arrived. Luckily they fitted me in. So disappointing as Forest Mere was always my go to place to relax and unwind and I was so looking forward to taking my daughter in June when she turns 16 and finishes her exams.  I would strongly suggest that you check how the construction work is progressing and how it is impacting on the resort prior to your booking/stay.
-4; Poor food - very expensive for what is served, Terrible location of room, no sleep at all!! Next to lift near to bar.Reception not helpful when checkingout no bathroom light working in am!! Hard to find too... Sat nav not correct! Got charged for an already paid room, when queried got told to pay!! Did get a refund when i called after leaving the premisis 
-4; This is by far the worst hotel I have stayed at in London by a long shot. The room was semi clean and it was infested with fruit flies and they were all on our pillow and on the lightstrip dead behind the bed. There was no hairdryer, the toilet lid banged and vibrated through the room even time you closed it (it should have been a slow closing one). The noise outside the room (112 first floor) was horrific gone 11pm, there was a crossing located nearby and it beeped every few minutes and the window would not close properly so there was no chance of blocking the noise out. The bath has a massive crack in it so showering was the only option and although seemed clean enough on first inspection there were bits all over the bathroom floor, no bath mat, only 1 hand towel and where the second bath towel was stored (by the door at the top of a hanging rail fixture, it was thick with dust and the towel smelt very similar to the room, musty! Breakfast was ok, not great, there were no fried eggs or mushrooms and the baked beans had been sat there so long they had a skin over the top on them and were gloopy. The croissants were so cold they were bordering frozen as they were hard. Also when I arrived at the hotel at 2:15pm I was told I couldn't check in until 2:30 or I would be charged £10, so I went and sat down for a bit only to be met by a massive queue at 2:30. I would definitely not recommend this hotel or stay in a Travelodge again! 
-4; I have stayed at this hotel at least once a year for the last 5 years, to use the spa packages.   On my last visit though standards had dropped massively. Our first issue was the robes we were given had fag burns in and make up marks on. We called the reception to request new ones and the receptionist said they would bring fresh ones up to our room,they never arrived.   We hired the hot tub for an hour half way through a worker enter with two other guests and interrupted.   At the dinner that evening we asked for our veal to be cooked well done, the waitress then told us the chef would not cook it we'll done as it ruins the taste even though we said that was ok, we were made to choose something else from the menu. That didn't have much choice.   That evening I had to complain as there was a group of ten girls being loud and running up the corridors and slamming doors at midnight, silly drunken behaviour. I felt like I was in the etap. Thankfully they were told to quieten down but I don't expect that from a quiet spa weekend.   At breakfast we asked to move tables as we were sat by a door that was open and it was freezing. The waitress was very rude and didn't want to move us, we had to ask twice to move tables.   I definitely won't be returning. I've actually booked into a different spa/hotel for in a few months  Such a shame as I use to go here so much. 
-4;" I'm not one to leave bad reviews but I couldn't let this one go!!!  I stayed at The Richmond Gate hotel for 2 nights whilst on business and I don't think I've ever experienced such horrendous service and my room was awful:  1. Check in was quick but they insisted on debiting £100 from a card just in case I had any extras even thought I knew I wouldn't have any - Not too much of a problem, but what they neglected to tell me was that it would take 3 working days to refund any money I didn't use!!!!  2. I stayed in room 34 which seemed to be in the back of beyond, up some rickety stairs and in the attic. When I asked to be moved, I was told the hotel was full, however when I called our corporate travel company they were able to book rooms.  3. I woke up after the 1st night to find around 50 dead flies all over the bathroom!! There were another 30 covering what looked like an attic door in the ceiling. I told reception of the problem on my way to the gym at 7am. I went back to my room at 8.30am and the problem hadn't been resolved - the flies were everywhere, including on and around my toothbrush!!! I called reception again and asked for someone to clean it up and was told &quot;house keeping will get round to it when they can!&quot; So I had to shower with the flies. It took until 2pm for someone to clear them but they re appeared the following morning.  I spoke to FIVE different people in reception and non of them were helpful or showed any interest in resolving the above points.  To make matters worse, I left my iPhone 5 charger in my room when I left so i phoned to ask if they would post it. After THREE calls and talking to THREE different people someone eventually said they had recovered it, would post it and this time would waiver the charge - how kind!!!! However it turned up last week and its NOT an iPhone 5 charger so someone else also must have left their charger - I know have it!!!!  As you can imagine I wasn't happy with my stay and explained all of the above to the duty manager and I was told the general manager would call me back - that was 4 weeks ago and I'm still waiting.  All in all, I will not be staying at this hotel again!! The Richmond Hill hotel next door is a much better option. "
-4;"Myself and two friends booked a deal via Travelzoo for a Spa day which included use of the leisure facilities, a beauty treatment and cream tea. In summary: 1. The pool area is very tired and drab, badly lit and not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel.  2. The jacuzzi was so hot that we couldn't sit in it even after we asked for it to be turned down. 3. There was no one on the leisure desk reception or spare towels available. 4. The towel on the bed was not changed between myself and my friend having treatments as it was still damp from my bikini bottoms and she could feel it against her skin. 5. When we went to order our cream tea we were told there were no scones left. We asked what the alternative was and had the choice of lemon cake or millionaires shortbread. Not very happy with this we asked if we could have a sandwich instead which was reluctantly agreed.  We left feeling quite deflated after looking forward to an afternoon of relaxation so emailed the hotel to advise them of the issues we had experienced.  The reply from the general manager was swift but in my opinion unsatisfactory, claiming that that temperature of the jacuzzi was &quot;safe and correct&quot;. There were other ladies there that didn't go in for the same reason and I'm not sure how after the event he can check the temperature when we were there! In summary, I would NOT recommend rhis hotel to anyone."
-4; Special trip ruined by very poor service. Only staying one night as a special treat. Check in delayed by over half an hour. We went to the bar to wait and was seated by a young girl but after 20 mins was asked to move saying the table was reserved. (No one turned up to use it). Room dusty and lights and TV not working. Nothing rectified when complained. The staff was very young and clearly couldnt manage  Dinner and breakfast very average. Hotel advertises what looks like a large swimming pool but turns out to be a small plunge pool which doesn't allow children. Our eight year old was very disappointed . Complained and received call from manager, Sean, who offered us 30% off a £300 room (no food). Definitely would not go again. 
-4; I have never been in a filthier hotel before .The AC was not working in the middle of the summer,the bathroom arrangement was in a bizarre form the basin was outside of the toilet it means you need to get out of the toilet to reach the basin to wash your hands .what a peculiar thing to do .the bed reminded us of the military camp boots in the middle of the war. When we went to the restaurant the staff were very confused about our orders and the food took a long time to come and the food was extremely bland no matter how much salt or pepper you would put on the food will still taste bland.On top of all that it is utterly expensive for what you get. 
-4;I made a booking for Christmas when I ran up to find out where my email was to confirm this they know nothing about my booking, tried to blame my friend for making a mistake with he booking, my friend never been rang them ever, it's now completely destroyed our chistmas as it the 7 th of December and we will be un able to get anywhere eles. They also did this to me in January when we got there they said it was for a different day and if the weren't for the email they sent me with the right date on it we would have have to go home, ( but according to them just on the fone they never send emails) I think the are all liars there no one knows the right arm from there left. Also my last stay there we asked for no smoking and and all along the corridor smelt of ciggys, was even coming thoughts our room. We also waited nearly a hour for breakfast we rang up to the room had to ring up twice to find out where it was,This place is not all it's suppose to be and if you want to avoid disappointment I would avoid this like the plague, be very aware that when you speak to anyone the havnt a clue what someone eles just told you, then try to shift the blame to anyone they think they can get away with, I had been 4 times in 3 weeks and one to 2 of the four visits we was either let down or something was wrong. I am writing this on here as I don't want anyone eles to be let down spesh over Christmas or anytime as this is not a cheap place to stay, but you get cheap quality, please read this and don't fall into the same trap I did and face the disappoint we just have. Be aware if you do get the booking you asked for once you have paid the customer service goes out of the window, all they are interested in is taking you money then if you have a issue with anything they just ain't bothered, you will be lucky if they even ring you back tbh.
-4; I'm going to start with the only plus which was that staff were all lovely and very helpful. This hotel is insanely over priced for what you get. Really dated, basic and naff. The pool and spa were closed, which we were unaware of when we booked. We were not allowed to change our booking and if we cancelled wouldn't get any money back so we decided to go anyway. Our room was drab, and not 'luxury' in the slightest. Just really substandard and cold. The bathroom was covered in rust and mildew and the toilet water was yellow. 
-4;"I am writing this review standing outside our room - we have been unable to access our room for 25 minutes despite 3 trips to reception and a phone call from my mobile phone to reception - they are now gone &quot;to look for the emergency key &quot; absolutely no idea how to care for guests - the only saving grace was yesterday - meeting the gracious duty manager Mr Eltahnawy who was charming and hospitable. ( someone put this man in charge!) Same fiasco yesterday when we ordered drinks at the bar yesterday and waited half an hour for them- had to ask three times - staff seem to have absolutely no idea what they are doing .  We have just managed to get into the room ourselves - no answer from reception so we can let them know we have opened the door - abysmal"
-4; We travelled to Torquay from Bristol today to take my mum for a special lunch to celebrate a special occaision. I booked a table at the brasserie in the Grand Hotel. We have stayed in this hotel a few times and eaten in the Brasserie separately a few times too. The view is lovely over Torquay.  Today we walked out after over 45 minutes without having had anything to eat or drink. We were shown to our table and that was it. No-one came near us again. Tables around us were coming in after us and getting served. I went up to the bar to ask for menus. I tried many times to get someone's attention, both at our table and at the bar. No-one came to take our order. No-one even looked in our direction. We felt like second class citizens so we decided to leave. We then had to wander around Torquay looking for somewhere else to eat, my mum, my 4 year old and me. We finally found somewhere to eat at 3.30, all starving.  The man on reception did offer to take us back in and serve us himself, but it was too late, we were embarassed and the day was ruined.  We were so disappointed as we have had some lovely times at the hotel before, but we will not be returning as we were treated so poorly. 
-4; We booked this hotel for our 3 days break. Hotel room we get was dirty and smells really badly of mould. Kids were scared to take a bath and disgusted to even sleep in that room . Bathroom very dirty, carpets dirty and very unfriendly and rude staff. Definitely not RECOMMEND TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN!!! DISGUSTING !! 
-4; We wanted so much to like you Peterham Hotel. I telephoned to make a reservation but was not told that the restaurant was closed even though I said we would stay for supper.  Breakfast started late at the weekend and we had to leave earlier. It would have been impossible to order breakfast to our room as the bedroom measured 9ft x 12ft unless one of us wanted to eat in the armchair and the other the other side of the room on the desk. There was no bar. There was an open plan atrium where one could order a drink but it was soulless and depressing so my husband, having spent £5.50 on a Peroni, was surprised there was a 69p on the bill under Room Service Bar. One would not quibble but it has to be said as hotel guests we were made to feel an intrusion. The River Room was in full flow with an event on arrival and the Cellar had an event the following night. Both catered for but not us as hotel guests. One would expect much more of this hotel. First night the soft pillows made it impossible to sleep so I had to have a word with reception the next day. The staff were reactive as opposed to proactive. The splendid Victorian Gothic interior did not make up for the cold atmosphere of this hotel 
-4; I'm so upset with our stay. The extractor fan is broken in our room and I called reception to say it was making a very loud noise and was very disruptive. The nice chap got his manager who told me 'if you have a problem then you should check out'.  It was 10pm on a Friday night! This is not the customer service you want! 
-4; Having booked a room and arranged a large get together I was informed that my booking had been accepted by mistake and that the hotel was fully booked. Having made alternative arrangements to stay with family (not ideal) I then received an e-mail saying that I had not registered for my reservation and to contact them to avoid being charged! I received a further e-mail asking for feedback on my stay!! Despite e-mailing them asking them to confirm they had not and would not be making any charged (they have my card details) they have failed to respond 
-4;I stayed at this hotel for three nights. Breakfast was cold on one day and they ran our on another causing a long queue. The lift in the Dorchester annexe was a health hazard and broke when I was staying. I had no hot water for two days in my room. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told that the reception supervisor was the manager. I was refused a reduction as I was on a 'special rate'. One to avoided.
-4; During the 2 day event held at the Taplow house, we experienced Vegetarian Food that had meat in it, the staff didnt seem to care even though 2 of the vegetarians were sick, apparently its not important as they were not religious!!!!  Food left in our room all day, No drinks provided and dodgy flooring.. More of a nightmare than an experience! Would not recommend  When asking to speak to the manager on several occasions they sent in the Chef, as he was to scared to say he was the manager. 
-4; Booked this as a 'pre-baby' treat with 3 friends - we just went to the spa (we did not stay in the hotel). It is without question, the worst spa I have ever been to:  Dutifully filled out the spa registration form and highlighted I was very allergic to lavender... the therapist failed to read the form, used lavender in my facial. The spa admitted that she had not read the form...as a result I ended up with a full on migraine for three days - not ideal at any time, but far from ideal when pregnant. They offered some Elemis samples to compensate...trust me a few sample does not make up for three days in bed with a migraine. A spa has a duty to check on allergies and read a consultation form.  The therapists were poorly trained. The massage was awful. Ended up swimming in oil, zero technique and the therapist had horribly scaly, dry hands - horrid for a massage, even worse for a facial!   Changing rooms are tiny.  Lunch - they were unable to tell us the full list of ingredients...which with a friend in the group with a food allergy this wasn't ideal. They also got our lunch order wrong (twice).  We ordered afternoon tea. The crumpets were shrivelled. The scones so hard that they wouldn't even cut...we sent it back. Second time round it was better and they admitted the scones had been over microwaved:( whereas the second time round they went to the main hotel to pick up fresh ones. It shouldn't have happened.  Rounded off by a cab back to the station with a driver who farted loudly for the whole trip!! That aside, the spa was a complete disappointment - badly trained therapists, poor service and a general lax attitude. The only positive thing I can thing of was nice oranges in the fruit bowl.  It was completely NOT worth the money. Avoid. 
-4; Went to meet my family who flow over from South Africa and had the worst experience.  Would definitely never recommend this hotel. Room service is shocking! No calls answered from reception l. No cot available for my daughter 
-4;" Don't know where to start but here goes. The food & service is the worst I have ever experienced. We were a large group on a 3 day stop over for Xmas never ever will any of us be returning. How can a 5 star hotel get it so wrong. I would only rate it 1 star & that's being generous. For anybody ever thinking of doing a Xmas break here &quot;don't bother&quot; what a waste of money. The worst Xmas dinner we have ever had it was cold some plates missing vegetables and pigs in blankets and had to wait 2hrs for our main after our starters, had to ask for condiments my husband waited 1hr & 20 mins for a beer and asked several times. Can go on & on think you get the point. Put us of for life ever wanting to go out for Xmas dinner again and we were not the only ones complaining. "
-4; room 30 far too small and far too hot we got our stuff and left with no refund.  we had driven from nottingham 2hours 32 mins to get there to be told wedding disco would be playing til midnight, obviously after driving that far on a hot day was the last thing we wanted. There wasnt anywhere to sit as the bed was against the wall so whoever gets that room you are expected to climb over your partner to get in and out. room inadequate for the price paid. hoping manager will see this and give us a refund as we couldnt stay in a small room with temps being high. I wouldnt leave my dog in a room that small and hot. Totally unfit for purpose and wrecked our weekend away without our children. Waste of time and money. Very disappointed. AVOID! 
-4;" First room allocated to us was absolutely disgusting;sticky, badly stained carpet, furniture shabby and stained, dressing table chair ripped and with stuffing coming out. Mould in bathroom. Totally unacceptable. Second room was marginally better - at least it was reasonably clean but the painted wallpaper was coming away from the wall in several places due to damp. There was a wooden Venetian blind but no curtains and no pictures on the walls. No dressing table chair. Plastic lining to lampshades was cracked and broken. Wooden furniture was stained and chipped. Walkway to 'restaurant' was badly lit and littered. We had no wifi in room despite being told it was available which made work impossible. If we hadn't been so tired and in need of a rest after a long day we would have left. I can't find anything to recommend about this place. "
-4; After a tumultuous and exhausting 24 hours which resulted in us and our sick baby being unable to fly to London in time for our booking, Novotel Blackfriars refused to change our booking to another night. Our circumstances were communicated to the hotel but they were very inflexible. Needless to say, we will not be staying at this Novotel or any Novotel any time in the future. 
-4; Lights were installed at the front of the building Christmas 2015 and have remained. The building is lit up like a cheap club. It looks like Peter Kay's Pheonix Nights night club. This beautiful Victorian building is set opposite a beautiful old Church with a pond and grassland. The surrounding buildings and houses have a village feel and overall the lighting is low.  I hope this lighting will be modified as it really spoils the look of where I live 
-4; We Did not stay here as we are local, but went for a meal for my Birthday it started off quite well we both chose the Lamb Kofta for starters and this was really nice, however it rapidly went downhill when the main course was served I chose the Lasagne and salad with a side order of chips, big mistake the chips were hanging limp over the edge of the bowl and were the type you get at McDonalds (actually McDonalds are better) they were pale and soggy and tasted as though the fat they had been cooked in had not been changed for sometime. The Lasagne was worse than one you buy as a cheap ready meal from a Supermarket it was thin and the meat filing was runny and did not resemble meat at all, the white sauce was thin and also runny. If you look at their menu on the web site it states the chips are homemade (what a joke) and that you get Garlic bread with your order (someone must have forgot to go to Tesco's). My husband also had the same awful chips but said that the Steak and Ale pie he had with them was actually nice, but did have a job to find much meat under the puffed up pastry top, I actually had an upset stomach the morning after. To top it all we both had Lager Shandy's my Husband because he was driving and these consisted mostly of Lemonade (if thats what you could call it) and was very sickly sweet. Definately do not go here for a meal not worth the money by a long shot 
-4;" I think this hotel was the worst have ever stayed in. I have never bothered to write a hotel review before because I have never had any significant problems, but today that has changed. The problems started at the outset when the hotel charged us double the price stated on our confirmation. This was not rectified when we emailed the hotel and after calling, we were assured the money would be returned to us. However, when we arrived at the hotel, the money had still not been refunded. This was thoroughly unsatisfactory, and the &quot;apology&quot; email was made redundant by the fact that they had not transferred the money until we arrived at the hotel. The refund should have been made the minute the complaint was lodged, not when we arrived and mentioned it for the fourth time. We found the staff at the reception desk to be most unhelpful and quite rude any time we spoke to them. When we booked online the website said wifi would be included, so when the receptionist offered us “complimentary wifi” as compensation for our inconvenience, we were quite bemused. We did, however, decide to try and let the rocky start go. When we got to the room, upon inspection it looked fine. However, the room was very dark and the one lamp that looked as though it would give off the most light was broken (there were no ceiling lights in the main bedroom area). We were having issues with logging onto the wifi so went downstairs to reception to ask them about it and report the issue with the lamp. When I asked about the wifi, the man at reception took my phone and logged into the wifi and said “look it’s working” in a rather condescending tone, as if it was the easiest thing to do. No one had explained to us how to use it and there were 4 different “Gloucester” wifis available to log onto and when I had typed in the code myself it had come up as “invalid”. As he had not actually shown me how to do it myself, we were still unsure how to logon with our other devices. Furthermore, when I asked if the code would work on more than one device he did not answer me and started talking to one of the other receptionists. We then told him about the broken light, which he assured us would be fixed but at the end of our stay it was still broken, leaving our room rather dark and dingy. When we were checking out, one of the receptionists must have misheard us as spent 5 minutes trying to find us on the system for checking in. Not surprisingly, her attitude was pretty dreadful, accusingly asking us if we were giving the right name, treating us as if we were in the wrong, rather than accepting the fact she had misheard us saying that we were checking out than checking in. The attitude of the reception staff any time we spoke to them was ridiculously bad and I have never experienced such abysmal customer service. The worst part of it all is that at no point no one offered us an apology; an apology goes a long way. I had left a feedback form at the hotel, stating some of these issues, so it was surprising to me when I received an email two days after our stay saying the hotel was glad we enjoyed our stay. This added insult to injury and I think it is very apparent they do not read the feedback forms. I had emailed back to tell them of their error, and was waiting on a reply before I posted a review on here (something they suggested I do in the email, thinking I had enjoyed my experience). After a week of waiting, however, I have had no reply, and so I am posting my one star review (it would be zero if possible), due to the complete lack of care the hotel has shown towards me as a customer. It's a shame because the hotel is in a fantastic location, and despite it needing some modernisation it is relatively nice, but I will not be returning. "
-4; We went for a xmas lunch yesterday as a small party of four. The ambience was wonderful as always but as for the lunch - the soup was luke warm and the main meal was practically cold. We do not complain without cause but felt that we should. As did the party of six on the next table. The next table were offered a complimentary tea or coffee and were apologised to but as we were the first to complain we were ignored. Pointing out to a waiter that we had complained in the first instant we were brought complimentary tea and coffee but there was no apology. Having used Saunton Sands Hotel on many occasions over many years and knowing the good reputation of the Brend Group we were very surprised at the rate of service we received. One person in our party had already booked another party but she is now considering cancelling after our lunch yesterday. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. 
-4; I stayed at this hotel many times over the last part of 2013, and it has to be the most consistently poor hotel I have ever stayed in...and as a business traveller, that's quite an accomplishment!! The only good things I can say are that parking is great and the staff are always helpful. But that doesn't outweigh the awful, outdated (chipboard wallpaper) rooms and the terrible food. On my first stay there, the room menu was smeared with someone else's food and old lettuce, so that sort of set the tone and them I noticed the floor had not been hoovered. Less said about that the better. The beds are like two camp beds that have been screwed together, and they squeak and move every time you get up or sit down. I would frequently leave my room in the morning and last night's room service tray would still be outside in the hall. Disgusting. Apart from the hygiene issues I had the usual problems of tv's not working! A/C loud and wouldn't switch off, room service orders rarely right etc etc. the manager always tries to ring to 'ask for your feedback' and to 'resolve the situation' but really, just get it right and save people the extra, unwanted conversation!! 
-4; Myself and colleagues stayed for 1 night prior to a conference.we didn't have a good start as there was some confusion with our booking, resulting in asking for payment for rooms already paid for by our place of work! We went to our rooms which were ok slightly small, but cold. My room appeared fine at first but when I got my second pillow out of the wardrobe a dirty pillow case had not been changed.... This was nothing compared to my colleague! She was really distressed at 1130pm whilst she was asleep two people entered her room terrifying her.... They had been given the key to the room believing no one else occupied it... This followed by duty manager calling her sometime later and then another person coming into her room early in the morning! At breakfast she wasn't on the guest list and on returning to collect her thing she couldn't gain entry as her key now would not give her access! She complained and asked for an explanation from the duty manager who could offer no answers. She gave her address and contact number and as of tonight still hasn't had a call offering any sort of explanation! 
-4;" I have to say this has to be one of the worst hotels i have stayed in. On arrival I had to wait 10 minutes before i was even spoken to. Reception staff were too busy chatting in the back to deal with customers. Given my key and told i was on the 5th floor. The lift was clean but finger prints on the glass. On arrival of the 5th floor i was greated by a dirty landing ( not what you come to expect at this level of hotel) I doubt the landing had been vacumed in a week. The room was not much better, the shower was clean but i dont like stained bed sheets im sure it would have been spotted if the cleaners had even looked when changing the sheets.The pillows were old and smelled of stale sweat. I went to reception to have the bed changed yet this took 4 hours to be done good job i was going out to eat and not wanting to go straight to bed. The following day even though i had placed a do not disturb sign on my door i was rudly awoken by a knock on the door and &quot; housekeeping&quot; been shouted. They just walked into the room glad i was still covered by the sheet. At this i packed and left the hotel cutting short my stay by 2 days and booked into another hotel ( half the cost and so much better) All i have to say on this hotel is if everything else is fully booked then stay at home its so not worth it. "
-4; Where do I begin!  We were moved to this hotel by The Haven, since our booking with them was slightly fragmented, the our room change had a low level noise, due to the boiler room below and I did not like the frosted cover on the windows.  The Receptionist at the Haven was wonderful and he found us a room with their sister hotel (Harbour Heights) and assured us that this was of the same standard and would therefore not spoil our last night.  We reached the hotel to find music blaring out from the building adjacent to our room. The noise was horrendous, not at all what we were promised and far worse than the low level noise we had moved from!  When I complained to the Receptionist she suggested that people were always made aware when a private function was taking place, hence giving them the choice to book elsewhere. After a heating discussion she assured us that the noise would end at 10.45pm and reluctantly I returned to our room.  In the ten minutes during which the music abated, what I can only describe as the sinking of the Titanic erupted from next door, a Jacuzzi bath had been turned on making the door to our room reverberate. Just as we settled down to sleep, the music erupted again, only this time with more intensity.  When I voiced a second complaint, this time to the Manager, he was adamant that the sister hotel would have been informed and we had accepted the room. His attitude was utterly appalling.  I therefore spent the next hour asleep in our car in the hotel car park. It was the only way I could gain some rest before our drive home the next morning.  How this hotel has received 4 stars is beyond my comprehension, when they treat customers in this manner. Of the three hotels in this chain (FJB Collection), this, is even worse than The Sandbanks! It is a pity that all staff are not up to the high standards of The Haven, where we spent a thoroughly enjoyable 3 days. 
-4; I would never choose to listen to Avicii's song 'Wake Me Up' - country-dance isn't a genre of music that should ever exist. However, myself and my wife had little choice when said song was reverberating around our room shortly before 2am.   I'd chosen 30 James Street as a romantic location to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, but little did I know we'd also be sharing the occasion with a wedding reception taking place in the hotel's function room above us. Being a laid back and placid couple, we initially decided to try and sleep through the din but, as the hours wore on, our tolerant nature had worn well and truly thin.    The music thankfully stopped shortly after 2am although we were then subjected to a further hour of furniture being dragged across the floor above us. It was therefore after 3am before either of us got any sleep which meant, due to tiredness, that our plans for the next day were somewhat ruined.   Why on earth the hotel's management allow guests to stay in the paper thin-walled rooms adjoining the function area when an event is taking place is unfathomable. Clearly none of them have been unfortunate enough to experience this unholy racket until the early hours otherwise they would not inflict it on their paying guests.    It's clear that a lot of money has been spent to open 30 James Street, but it currently seems confused as to whether it wants to be a high-end four-star or a novelty budget hotel catering for stag and hen parties. It should be aiming for the former, but sadly seems to be sliding towards the latter.   While it's obvious that other guests have enjoyed a positive experience here - indeed other Tripadvisor reviews swayed my decision - anyone willing to risk a booking should keep their fingers firmly crossed that a wedding won't be taking place on the same night, otherwise the notion of 'wake me up' will in no way relate to a sound night's sleep.   I should also note our booking claimed our room would contain a fridge and microwave - neither were present in the room we were given.   Stay here if: you like a hotel room to have the ambiance of a wedding disco.  Don't stay here if: you don't. 
-4; Cons Exterior has seen better days, hasn't been maintained in a while.  We were not shown to our room we had to find our own way with our luggage through very narrow creaky corridors which felt like a maze by the time we located our room tucked at the far rear of the hotel.   We had to carry our luggage up and down stairs as there was no lift where our room was located.  On the way to the room we had to step over guests dirty plates which had been left outside their doors and had not been cleared for hours after.  The room was SHOCKING! Single pane windows - no double glazing meant we could hear footsteps from the street below not to mention the loud traffic and bin collectors at 7am. It was horrendous. Windows were dirty and mouldy curtains were stained and tatty.  Room was very small had to squeeze around the small double bed to get to bathroom. Lamp was broken, room was dark and dingy - no minibar/fridge. Grubby bathroom.  A random fire exit door on corridor was left open. Did not feel secure at all.  Left waiting over 15 minutes stood at breakfast stood at the door waiting for a table to be set. Breakfast is basic, had to wait a while for food/juice to be topped up.  Pro's Lobby and bar area looks decent but it is the only well kept area in the hotel. Rooms are terrible compared to the lobby  Location is very good. Minutes from the beach and town. Nice views from the lobby.  This is less than 3* standard definitely NOT 4*  Very disappointing!    
-4; My Fiance and I stayed at Ettington Chase on the 3rd September for a Birthday weekend.   Upon arrival we were both very disappointed as the advertising pictures showed a beautiful period building however, we thought that initial impressions looked like a retirement home. A huge, unattractive building added to the side of what could have been a wonderful hotel.   We booked via booking.com and paid £90 for one night (no breakfast included). The reservation stated that check-in was at 2pm, we ended up waiting an hour and a half before our room was ready. During our wait we were told that our room would be ready in 30 mins so we waited and returned to be told it was still not ready. We waited in the bar whereby several staff passed us, looked down there nose at us and was not in the slightest bit pleasant or friendly. In addition, several other families were also waiting for rooms but arrived after us- to our amazement they were given their rooms first. I wasn't impressed!!   At 3.30pm we finally got our room which was clean, modern and seemed very nice (still not worth the money though). We had decided not to eat at the hotel, and after the inital checking-in process I was very happy not to either. We had slight reception difficulties with the TV signal and our plug was broken so a shower ended up being a rather disguting bath- I would have phoned for help but did not want to deal with the staff again.   Stratford was lovely, as usual and in future would stay closer to the town centre.   We decided to use the leisure facilities after our visit to Stratford and were pleased with the swimming pool and jacuzzi, however very disappointed that the sauna was out of order- not that the staff could be bothered to put an pology notice up. We discovered this when we noticed the lights were all out and the fuse box had been removed.   For the price we paid I would expect premium quality of everything but did not recieve anything close to this. I agree with other reviews that this 'hotel' is primarliy used as a conference centre.   I would not visit again and it have doubted my expectations of all Prinipal Hayley 'hotels'. After sending 2 complaints, I still have recieved no feedback... I think that somes up the hotel to a tee!! 
-4; The disappointment following our stay for our annual company conference is immense!  Words cannot describe the appalling service at lunch - inedible food and then a wait of half an hour whilst the kitchen produced half rounds of processed white bread with rancid fillings, incredible. No apology or attempt to rectify the situation. Dinner was even worse. Most of our table returned the meals at least twice and then gave up!! I have never experienced anything like it. We are a Training Provider trying to encourage young people to join what we believe is a wonderful industry with fantastic opportunities and this Hotel is an example of high standards? I don't think so. The only saving grace was the Housekeeping. My room was very clean and extremely comfortable. The rest of the Hotel, shocking 
-4; It pretty much says it all in the title!! I was at the conference on Friday 27th, thankfully I did not stay for the evening so I did not have the trauma of a long bag drop off, no room, lost luggage or an awful evening meal. I have no idea how the hilton expected us to deliver workshops where they set up tables to place laptops and projectors on yet there were no power cables!, I was asked to find a member of staff to sort it out but there was nobody to be found. At lunch time I was fortunate to get one of the last dry rolls before they ran out and was starving for the rest of the day. There was a large room for drop-in workshops and bearing in mind there were nearly 500 people present, a member of staff bought in a basket with about 10 chocolate bars, 6 packet of crisps and 6 tins of pop! As I was waiting to leave a colleague rang me as she had someone else's luggage in her room, I fail to understand how the hotel managed thus when people labelled their bags prior to arrival. If you want to stay in a hotel with awful customer service, stale dry food, that's if they don't run out and dirty public areas the Hilton is the place to be. 
-4; We booked the hotel for one night on Saturday 7th September. We booked the package through Secret Escapes, we booked a relaxing night's stay including VIP passes to Westfield, Burlington Arcade and 10% off at Liberty's - none of these were offered to us. We also had in-room movies included as part of the package which we had to ring down to reception twice to activate - it's a good job we had the movies to be honest as we were faced with a nightclub in the reception when we checked in!  We had rung up in advance to advise we wouldn't be checking in until after 11pm as we were going to Proms in the Park, we arrived at 11.30pm to find 3 bouncers on the door and a nightclub in what we later found out to be the breakfast area of the hotel. We couldn't hear anything the receptionist was saying when we checked in and had to ring down to reception in the morning to check what time check out and breakfast were. We were completely dissatisfied with the whole break and would not recommend this place to anyone wanting a relaxing break away! STAY AWAY! - For the money it's not worth it... next time I'll go to the Travelodge or Ibis - at least they don't mislead you! 
-4;" I have been a Vegetarian for at least 30 years and have never been offered ONLY MASHED POTATOES AND VEG. The menu says &quot;Meat Free Carvery All your favourites from the Carvery (without the meat!) & Vegetarian Gravy £7.95&quot;, it does not make it clear that this is all that is available for Vegetarians, even the roasties are done in meat fat. When I complained I was told that there were Vegetarian options on the main menu - pity it was not made clear that you were paying £7.95 for mashed potatoes and veg. I have had &quot;Meat Free&quot; Carverys many times before and it is usual to offer a nut roast so that you can join in with friends that are having the meat carvery. This Hotel may think it doesn't have to bother with what it perceives to be minorities, but we don't go around on our own, we are members of sometimes large groups of family and friends, none of whom will be eating here if some of their number are Vegetarians. "
-4; We recently held our staff Christmas do at the Coppid. I should have realised from the start that it would not be a good experience. We were continually hassled for the deposit and balance and they then made a mistake with the bill resulting in us each paying another £3.50 which they reluctantly agreed could be paid on the night. During the meal I was continually harrassed for the money, even though one of our party could not attend so they had received her money for nothing. The meal was absolutely awful, in my case the vegetarian consisted of two pepper halves filled with tasteless lentils. The rest of the party found the food almost inedible and the waiters looked as if they had been dragged off the street. The only saving grace was the cabaret and free entry to the night club. I cannot speak for the hotel itself but the Christmas package leaves a lot to be desired - I think we would have preferred basket meals instead of the three courses on offer. 
-4;"I travel to London four or five times a year- and always use last minute top secrets hotels and have never been disappointed. We got dropped off at the hotel and we went to check in and the doorman gave us both a very unpleasant look- after a 7 hour journey in a van, we (naturally) didn't look our best. Checked in just fine- but the worse was still to come. Rooms are tiny and incredibly dated- serious refurbishment works are needed seriously and hopefully they will come in the next year or so or I can't see many people wanting to stay here. TV looked older than I am- 20 years old. We didn't even try breakfast- I recommend the Giraffe cafe opposite Kensington gardens, we frequently go there when we visit the city.   Agree that the location is great- for someone who cannot walk far without getting tired it was ideal from this point of view. When we were being collected the next day by a friend we explained about my disability and if our friend could possibly park in the car park for a few minutes while we got loaded up and in etc- but no, it was for &quot;guests use only'- technically, it was for guest use. I don't think it would of hurt them to let our friend park her van their for a few minutes to save the 30 minute train journey to meet her when I was exhausted- but no.   I won't be staying again"
-4;" I am a 59 year old woman who went to this hotel to celebrate my 60th birthday,we went to the spa which is in need of a makeover.In the evening we went for dinner in the restaurant,the meal was under average but when we complained we were fobbed off with some chocolates. We then tried to enter the Beir Keller where I was refused entry even though I had paid with my package.Apparantly our party was being watched by management whilst eating and I was deemed out of seven women to appear to be &quot;sleepy&quot;. My 60th birthday was completely ruined by the staff on duty, there whole demeanor was rude and patronising, they even frogmarched my sister from the club and said that she was me and had changed her dress , how pathetic, we as a group will never return to this place ever again, "
-4;" if you are thinking about booking this hotel then dont! worst experience ever.. reception staff were not very friendly or welcoming. very dull entrance to the hotel. bar area was filthy and waited ages to get served and then when we did it was &quot;what do you want&quot; no hello, how are you or even a smile! dinner in the evening tasted like a microwave meal from tesco's. breakfast was awfull. hot food was stone cold and was never getting topped up. staff smelt like stale spirits from the night before & one young girl looked like she had just stepped out of a night club with all the make up she had on! i will never be staying here again. "
-4; Stayed here as found a very good offer, but was still overpriced. Very surprised by the lack of quality throughout, especially in our room. Room much smaller than appeared on website too. Avoid unless they spruce it all up. 
-4;" In a word this place is awful ... I was taken here for my Birthday and there was a series of events throughout the whole weekend that put me off the place ... We arrived on Friday night and had room service, was ok nothing to write home about. Breakfast arrived on Saturday morning and there was no tea in the pot (nor on the tray) and no milk. Having failed to reach room service we reached Reception who sent someone with the missing ingredients ... We went for a drink at lunchtime and the beer was hot (not suprising given the beer fridge was open ) having pointed out to the member of staff we were served our drinks only to find he continued to leave the fridge open. We requested a bucket of ice for our beer to cool them down only to be given a look of disgust at such request. We returned to our room at 6pm on Saturday to find that our dinner from the previous night and our breakfast tray was outside our room however the dirty tea cups were beside our beds. The bathroom was filty, the bath hadn't been cleaned and the extern to the shower was filthy where someone had clearly sneezed on the toilet and left snot down the shower screen. At dinner my fiance ordered a bottle of champagne for my birthday and we were left outside without our champagne for 30 mins. When we eventually flagged down a waiter we asked where our champagne was to be told that it was waiting for us at the table (however we couldnt' go to the table as the Chef wasn't ready for us, 10 mins later we were seen to the table for the first drink of the evening). We tried to complain on check out but the reception &quot;girl&quot; was less than receptive to our feedback and to be quite frank after a weekend at Fawlty Towers we were keen to make our getaway. We wrote a letter of complaint when we returned home and after 2 weeks we hadn't received a response. On chasing it up we were told that a letter had gone in the post (funny how it took 7 days to arrive) and we were offered a complimentary stay at Rookery Hall for one night. However the letter was a) riddled in spelling and grammar errors and b) the complimentary voucher was addressed completely to the wrong person. Given all of the above and taking into account my Fiance paid £700 for a two night stay, I would not hurry back to this place - IF AT ALL ..... "
-4;" In May 2011 I booked my annual golf/spa event at Old Thorns to take place in August 2011. We have a group of around 30 people who have been attending this event for the past 10 years at various venues around the country. This is the first time in those 10 years that I have felt the need to write a negative review!   After agreeing the date for booking and rates I was advised that all was booked, but that I was being passed to a new representative to deal with our ongoing booking. I have no problem with that as this is a fairly common scenario over the time period of such a booking. After a few weeks of not hearing from the new contact I dropped them a call to make sure all was in hand and ask a few specific questions. This call was shortly followed up by the receipt of an email from them, which is where the fun began! I was advised that due to a new reservations system being implemented my booking had been completely cancelled! Not to worry though, they had a solution in mind - that being to put 10 of the rooms I had booked in something akin to a garden shed under the pretence of this being a fun alternative to a hotel room! Now, call me fussy, but when I book a 4 star hotel room for a weekend break, I generally do not expect to have to bunk up in an outside cabin with no facilities, even at a slightly reduced rate that was offered. It may well be a fun &quot;glamping&quot; experience if that's what you are looking for, but if I wanted to go camping, guess what, I'd go camping!  My request to simply remove the later bookings that had been made after mine and put them into the sheds fell on deaf ears, as did my request for the manager to contact me to discuss the matter. Instead, they proposed ferrying us to alternative hotels after our dinner - again, if I wanted to stay in a different hotel, guess what I would have done!   So anyway, there ends my review! I have no idea what the hotel is like, or the food, or the leisure facilities...I wish I did! However, on reading a few more reviews on this site it seems this is an endemic customer service issue within this hotel and we may actually have dodged a bullet on this one. I look forward to taking my large and valuable booking to a hotel with some level of competence! "
-4; VeryWonky hotel, especially on the third floor.... The floor and ceiling were literally wonky!!!!!  Not only that, my room wason the third floor. Got lift to third floor and had to walk up some stairs then down some stairs. My poor mother who has difficulty in walking found navigating to the room very stressful!!!   The bathroom window would not open, the bedroom curtains fell down.   It was a terrrible stay. Premier Inn is a 10 times much better and that was a budget hotel, atleast the floor wasn't wonky!! 
-4; I stayed at this hotel in June 2012 with my husband, my one year old son and elderly parents. We stayed for 2 nights and although our first nit was fine our second was terrible. We had not been told that there was a pre planned travellers wedding on this night. It was therefore very busy and lots of disruption to the none wedding party guests. None of us got much sleep because of the chaos that went on through the night. Unfortunately this included in the corridor outside of our room. We were all knackered the next morning and unable to fully enjoy Chester zoo which was our purpose of the visit. Bouncers at the hotel did Little to stop the problems. Was very disappointed with the service and consideration that we received as paying guests. Definitely would not return to this hotel which is a shame. We woke up in the morning to find drunken males from the wedding asleep on the floor in th corridor outside of our room. There was food, bottles and cigarettes on the floors which we had to pick our way through to get to breakfast! 
-4; I stayed at this hotel 2days ago as a complimentary stay as my first stay i ate an egg shell which was inside my fried egg!! I was assured if i stayed again they would regain my trust in them.. however this stay was even more diabolical than the previous! My room 142 (Supposedly Executive) was absolutely freezing. I called down on various occasions to advise of this and i was told i need to turn the heating up like i had no common sense what so ever! The heating was up to highest point but blowing out cold air instead of hot. Me and my 2 YOUNG children were subjected to sleeping in our clothes as the room was just not warm enough. the following morning i brought this to their attention again and i asked if there was a portable heater, the lady replied ohh yes there is and brought one up. Now had i not have suggested this we would have frozen the rest of the day as well as last night. No one Apologised for the faulty heater or offered to change rooms to a warmer one. Breakfast was mediocre and although it was supposed to be later at the weekends i went down at 10am and felt as though i was being rushed... the member of staff we saw checking his watch confirmed this. Never again!! 
-4;Booking was wrong, no fans available, very little assistance from staff, overcharged took me 4 weeks to get my money back (as they advertised a no quibble price guarantee ) spoilt a surprise break that I had arranged for our anniversary
-4;" we have just stayed at this hotel for 1 night - this was our first time at a &quot;Mercure&quot; hotel and would have to say we were very impressed. We found the staff extremely helpful and enjoyed the large open bar area - what a lovely space to sit and enjoy a few drinks on arrival before we ventured out to enjoy watching the wonderful balloon festival and the great atmosphere which Bristol does so well.  Our daughter lives in Bristol and we come regularly to see her usually staying at the Marriott - I think &quot;Mercure&quot; might just have won us over! Many Thanks for a wonderful stay. "
-4;This was a second visit to compensate for our first visit that was a disaster. We were told we would have an upgraded room which to be fair we did. However the Windows didn't shut and were dirty with mould on them. The shower was broken,no point complaining as from previous experience no body cares. Food not great, drink well over priced. Man allowed in female changing rooms in pool area. Staff constantly complaining about the hotel, bar ran out of tapped beer even though there was a wedding at the hotel. Gardens very shabby all windows in very poor condition. Decor very dated. Will not be going back. Bed very uncomfortable very poor quality mattress.
-4; I stayed for one night and that was enough! Check in was abysmal, and when I offered my card to the receptionist she said she didn't need it, as I was staying on business and the room was on an account, this wasn't unexpected. When I got to my room my room card didn't work,I was eventually let in by a concierge. In the evening I ordered a bottle of wine £35!!!! For cheap Pinot Grigio I was informed I'd have to pay for it when leaving the restaurant, despite trying I couldn't find anyone when I left, but thought I'd pay for it when checking out... Big mistake! I was phoned at 11:30pm and told I had to pay for the wine NOW! Had to re-dress and go to pay for it. If you like being treated like a thieving toe rag, book your stay now. 
-4;" I gave my 96 yesr old father a 4 day break at this hotel. Although elderly he lives alone, looks after himself and still drives. However he has mobility issues and uses either a wheeled walking frame or a mobility scooter. I visited the hotel before booking and was delighted to learn that I could book a mobility schooter for him from a local firm who would deliver and collect it. He spent much of the 4 days sitting in his room, scooter unused, because he was unable to access any of the amenities, including the restaurant, because he couldn't open the heavy fire doors. He went out of his bedroom twice a day for breakfast and evening meal but had to rely on someone being about to open the doors. The lifts were also not easy. I have drawn the attention to the problems and received a written apology in which the Guest Services Representative admits that &quot;Thoresby hall is a large hotel with a complex layout, including many long corridors&quot; and &quot; the hotel can be difficult for anyone with mobility problems&quot; and &quot;it is not an easy building partuculary for a single person and the restrictions of the Grade 1 listing limit any furure alterations.&quot; Apparently the current literature is to be reviewed but in the meantime please be aware of these issues and do not book if you have any problems walking or are unaccompanied and use a walking aid or scooter. Incidentally the staff were delightful and the issues are not their fault. "
-4; 1. My room was changed from double to twin upon arrival. 2. They had to charge for UK converter from the minibar after they failed to lend me one, though I insisted on returning it back as I have so many at home, just forgot to bring one. They had to take advantage of customers' inconvenience instead of trying to help. And the staff's attitude was very cold and arrogant. 3. I asked them to put my cheese in the fridge after check-out for temporary luggage storage, but they failed to do that. I can't comprehend how they can fail such a simple task, which probably can only be explained as being careless and inattentive. 
-4; Booked as a last minute business trip to London, specifically for the location and price. Only upon arrival was I told their had been a problem with the system and the hotel was full. The only solution offered was a hotel at Heathrow. Totally unacceptable as my meeting was Central London and that is what I had booked. Very unfriendly, rude and unhelpful staff on reception and solution was only found after I refused the hotel at Heathrow.   Was transferred to another Shaftsbury Hotel in Earls Court which was not an ideal location but no complaints about the second hotel. The worse thing was I was made to feel responsible as I was told 'Well if we had your phone number we would have told you earlier'. As I was unable to complete my booking on Agoda without leaving a phone number and email address I fail to see how this is my fault. Will never book a Shaftsbury hotel and will never book with Agoda again.  And finally, as my taxi driver told me en route to the new hotel, this sort of thing happens alot with this hotel. 
-4; We booked upon arrival and were allocated room 301. The room was clean but there were cuts/rips in every curtain. It was absolutely the worst bed we have ever slept in. The mattress topper was so hard and lumpy we had to remove it, but the mattress underneath was so sunken in the middle that we both slept very badly and woke up with chronic back ache.  The cost was approx £180 for B&B and was the worst value for money we have ever spent during years of travelling. Next morning I informed reception of the appalling state of the bed but was not taken seriously and no genuine apology was forthcoming. Verdict - overpriced, uncomfortable, mediocre breakfast with no fresh bread available and a long wait for eggs so the rest of our breakfast got cold whilst waiting. We would never stay there again. 
-4; We have stayed at Seckford Hall previously and always regarded it as a delightful experience. We called in on Friday for lunch in the bar on our way elsewhere. We felt the same glow at the sight of the building as we drove down the drive and after that the glow rapidly dimmed. The hotel has just been taken over by new management and our first inkling that something was wrong was when we were presented with a large card type menu, reminiscent of the ones in burger or pizza restaurants. We ordered sandwiches and when they arrived we couldn't believe our eyes. The term canteen sandwiches come to mind rather than ones suitable for a luxury hotel. Poor bread, hardly any of the beef or ham filling we had ordered and the little bit that was there was tasteless, all accompanied by a meagre undressed salad. This was delivered by a rather pert waitress who told us she didn't do the cooking when we queried why the crusts on my husband's ham sandwich remained (curling round the edges) whilst mine had been cut off. Each sandwich cost an unbelievable £6.95. All very sad and we shall not be calling in for lunch again, let alone stay there. 
-4; the staff are very friendly and it was not their fault the builders renovating the hotel were cutting tiles and grinding to 8.30 pm at night and we were trying to get our son to sleep . we had to travel through the corridor of doom ,renovation every day, avoiding blue paint and dust and cables taped down ,not my idea of a relaxing holiday.the hotel splash pool was warm but the changing rooms looked like they have not seen any cleaning for a long time !!! the worst was the breakfast ,re heated tough hash browns ,having to wait for the croissants for 10 mins, never replenished in time but i have never EVER seen scrambled eggs like this before ,grey and rubbery and smelt of sulphur ,the waiter commented he was allergic to scrambled eggs !!!!! it was never worth £10 ,no choice, things missing like freshly baked bread and the hot chocolate was extra ,everything was extra !! the hotel is really cutting back on everything ,very disappointed and i will never stay in a jurys inn again , well done to the staff for keeping a smile and trying to do their best in a terrible hotel !!!! take note owners . 
-4; I recently attended a wedding at the hotel, the staff were all pleasant, however their lack of knowledge on what dishes they were serving was shocking. Originally serving me a plate with nuts on, when I have an allergy (which this information was given in advance), and then trying to tell someone else at my table there was no cheese in a cheesecake.. The bar available for the wedding party had a lack of stock, other guests commented on this and we had to make our way all the way through the hotel to the other bar to get the drinks we wanted. When we checked into our bedroom, the room was spacious, however the bed was uncomfortable. It was like sleeping on concrete. Rock hard, with a duvet only just covering the mattress width. Drawing the curtains there was a gap between the wall and the curtain fabric which let the light shine in, right onto the pillow, so when the sun rises first thing you're blinded and woken up. All in all this was a terrible night's sleep, I just wanted to get up and get out as soon as possible. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a relaxing get away 
-4; We arrived for afternoon tea and was very disappointed in the quality of the food. Stale bread. A wrap with sloppy coronation chicken in it. Had to ask 4 clean plates. Had to ask for more tea. The table we were sat at was so high but tge seats were so low. Again had to go looking for someone to ask 4 higher chairs. No one member of staff came over to ask if everything was ok. Think that for the price they charge the staff could be more courteous. The food should be spot on. Unfortunately we wont be returning. 
-4; Wow where to start!!! We booked this as a groupon offer so didn't expect a 5 star hotel (don't book a hotel groupon stay, they quite clearly need the business!!!) however this place was the pits. It used to be owed by de vere and you can see the nicer parts are remnants from them. The reception staff were ok, walking to our room down some strange airport looking tunnel into a tiny and dirty lift wasn't a great start. Then enter the room of gloom!! There were cracks on the walls dirt down ever part of the carpet that met the skirting the bathroom taps were falling off the plinth against the bath was rotten there was mould in the bath and on the ceiling the lamp next to the bed was broken the bed was strangely bouncy and you could hear the springs crunching it was disgusting. We had 2 small children with us and we were mortified by the sheer amount of dust and dirt. Couldn't get booked in for the evening meal as they had a coach of people coming for a meal there was a wedding party in the bar so we had to have room service with high chairs in the room!!! The food was grim dry tasteless and cold. The 22 year old manager didn't have a clue how to handle our complaints and simply walked off from us saying he didn't know what he could do to help us!!!! Idiot. Breakfast was ok but the food seemed cheap they didn't even have real rice crispies!! Dirty cheap tasting ones. The pool area was nice and the only thing we enjoyed. Will never ever return here not even for a free weekend!!! See the photos urgh!!! 
-4; on arrival my room was at the end of a corridor where builders were renovating 3 other rooms, (I was not told about the work they were carrying out), the noise was not good, I was told I had a reduce rate and the noise would stop at 5pm, but I could upgrade which I did, it cost me £190 extra without breakfast even thought my first rate was for bed and breakfast. 
-4; I stayed at this hotel with my friends, in a room advertised for 3 adults. On arrival, I was getting dressed with my friends and the next minute a male member of staff just opened the door and was about to walk in! No knock first and not much of an apology. Why was he coming into our room we wondered anyway. I was It was advised that one of the beds would be a put you up style bed, which is fine. However, on arrival, the room was tatty, not that clean and only up to 2-3 star rating in my opinion. Very dated. The put you up bed was so uncomfortable and I was unable to sleep on it had to sleep with my friend which was not ideal. There was a join in the mattress right in the middle of my back which was so uncomfortable. Also, the sheet was just put on top of the mattress!!! No protective cover, so I wondered how many people had slept on this mattress and sweated into the fabric. I was disgusted. I am sure this would be against any health and safety regulations. The breakfast was ok, buffet but service of tea/coffee and soya milk very slow. Very  limited choice of bread. Cheap sliced white and brown bread and a cutting loaf which was nearly finished. I was also very disappointed to hear from my friend that she left her IPhone charger in the room and when she phoned to enquire, it was reported that it had not been found. I would worry about the honesty of the domestic staff. I styed at this hotel 2 years ago as it is near the venue we were attending and I was disappointed then too. Things do not seem to have changed. I advised the receptionist when I checked out of the problems but he just apologised (not bothered). 
-4;We visited the hotel as my husbands work place had booked their Christmas party there. Food was shocking. I have food allergies and the hotel assured us that that is wasn't a problem as alternative food could be prepared. As soon as the food was brought out I was given the same food as everyone else. After speaking to the manager he looked at his list and sure enough there was my name with the food allergy written next to it. He took the food away I have to have a desert for my starter as there was nothing else they could offer. They then brought out the same desert for me to have as my main meal (What a joke) now we were unhappy with it the manager offered for me to have some chicken cooked which took about 45 minutes to arrive and when it did it was stone cold. By this point I had had enough. The food was taken back and we were shocked to receive the food back which had been simply reheated in an oven. The plate was red hot and so was the veg the Chicken sadly was still cold so it hadn't been reheated to temperature. After complaining yet again the manager was absolutely useless and rude. In the end I had a cheese baguette in the end which was even worse the baguette was one of these part baked ones that are supposed to finished off in the oven. They couldn't even be bothered to do that it had just been sliced and cheese slapped in the middle. By this point the lights had been turned down ready for the dancing to begin. So until I had biten into it I couldn't tell that it had not been baked. By this point the evening had been completley runined by the lack of competence. I couldn't be bothered to moan again as it was quite clear they couldn't be bothered. By 10 pm I was feeling unwell and we decided to go back to our room. That's also when the bad evening continued we me having food poisoning and collapsing in the.  Now the manager had given my husband his email address during the evening and assured us that he would sort something out for us as a way of compensating us for such a bad evening that we had. After 3 emails being sent it's now Febuary and we haven't had one reply back. We will never be going there again and will advise anyone not to bother with the place.
-4; I have often thought that it is better not to stay in a hotel if you can't find a good one. This hotel illustrates my theory. The bead for toast at breakfast is excellent, but otherwise there is NOTHING good about this hotel. The rooms are so pokey that you can literally hardly turn round. I am covered with bruises from bumping into the furniture. There's no storage. The corridors are long and drab. The building has no scrap of period charm left but nor is there anything sleek, modern and efficient about it. The beds are uncomfortable and everything feels cheap.  The hotel charges prices that are not much lower than those of the comfortable hotels in the area even though it is more like a cheap provincial hotel in a second-rate chain.  My advice: find a nice park bench. 
-4; We stayed here as part of a Chessington holiday (we went to Warner Bros studios and didn't want to drive home and back to go to Chessington the next day). The Tripadvisor reviews were OK, so we were hopeful. Having driven in to the secure car park, past the marina and swan sanctuary, we were impressed. We could see the gym, and on entering the hotel there were plush carpets and well kept business suites. The lady at reception was pleasant, and the open staircase to our room was very nice. However, then it all went wrong. We entered our room to find three tiny wall lights, and one bedside table lamp, on the opposite side of the bed to the desk and mirror. Despite it still being broad daylight outside, even with these lights the room was dark, and the towels in the bathroom had marks on. The ceiling was peeling and the walls had scrape marks along them. We advised reception of our main issue (the lighting) who offered us another room to look at, but this had an identical set up and also had trauma to the door (looked like someone had tried to kick through it). They then offered us an executive room upgrade for £25, but on looking at the room this simply secured us a second bedside lamp on the other side, and two bottles of water. Deciding that this did not warrant £25, we settled on our original room - where we discovered that the bathroom door was so misshapen it would not shut, despite the helpful wall sticker imploring us to shut the door when showering to prevent the steam from setting off their fire alarms.  We were not expecting the Ritz, we didn't pay a lot as part of our Chessington holiday. However, in our opinion a bathroom door that closes and sufficient lighting for two occupants to read simultaneously is a must.   Due to our disappointment, we went out for dinner in Shepperton rather than eat in the hotel. Breakfast at the hotel was included in our package - a self service buffet with hot and cold food. This wasn't bad...until we watched a small child drag his hands through the large bowls of cereal, along with his parents who did nothing. Grim. 
-4; The room was awful compared to the ones on the website it's a total rip off there's much nicer hotels for half the price, the food in the room had dust on it, it had been there that long and they didn't let us check in till 10 past 4 
-4; Stayed here at the weekend with friends. Had to change rooms because there was a strong smell of mould, the shower didn't work and the sink tap leaked all over the floor making it slippery.The replacement room wasn't any better, The hairdryer didn't work, the carpet had not been hoovered in a long time and everything was filthy. I tried to picked the tea spoon up to make a brew and it was stuck to the tray, on close inspection it looked like someone had used it to eat a yogurt! In general everything was either broken or dirty, The only positive was the friendly young staff. 
-4;" The old grandeur of this hotel looks great, but once you get through the doors, the terrible service ruins it! We were allocated the wrong room, then changed to a correct room (with balcony as requested and paid for!), only to find the room not made up with previous occupants stuff still in it. Being nice people we said we would go the bar so the maid could clean the room, waited an hour to get served a drink! Thought we would then take advantage of the spa, only to find the pool closed with no warning! Gave up when we stood at the door to the restaurant for 20 mins, being ignored by the waitresses. Ended up chatting to some diners, one couple had waited over an hour to get their wine for dinner, another couple had waited one and a half hours for a starter, which when it turned up was wrong!!!! We asked to see the Manager, what a joke! Incompetent, rude and with a shocking &quot;who cares&quot; attitude. £180 for the room, an absolute waste of money, don't go there!!!!! We got a refund and stayed elsewhere..... What a shame to ruin a beautiful old hotel like that!!!! "
-4; Table for nine, cold food. Poor value for money. Set menu £29.50 per person, scallops for starter..... one! 4 of the main meals sent back as cold, 3 eaten, the other 2 were ok. Still waiting for final course sat down at 2.00pm 
-4;Had a shockingly rude member of staff on the Saturday of the 40s weekend she criticised me for clearing the table we were sat at of dirty glasses. Possibly she was the owner as she was middle aged with glasses and the waitresses were young girls which was maybe why she felt she could speak to us the way she did. Maybe if the staff had cleared it in the first place I wouldn't have had to do it myself! I thought the number one of this business was good customer service and manners I haven't worked in catering but I know that much and people can take their money elsewhere which we did. I will not be returning or recommending this pub. Instead we ate at the Stirrups over the 2 days the service and food were excellent and I would highly recommend them. They coped really well with the business and stress of the weekend but still managed to keep civil tongues in there heads!
-4; I am a member at the Club and unfortunately forgot the children's towels for a lesson. The staff were less than helpful and were looking to charge me £6 for the 'use' of two paper thin cheap towels to get my children dried. I asked for the manager, who is never available, and then asked to see the manager of the hotel. The duty manager was less than helpful and offered me one towel free of charge to dry both my children. Clearly the concept of customer service is sadly lacking in this hotel. The attitude was disgraceful and unfortunately the staff seem to have to adhere to a 'rule book' as I was constantly quoted 'this is the policy sorry.' For a hotel that prides itself on customer service this experience has fallen short. Note to self. Do not forget towels again in the haste to dash out at 8am as the Lancaster House Hotel would rather a child be wet and cold than give you a towel. Goodness knows how they treat day guests. 
-4;" Where do I begin, I took my daughters grandson and friend away for a break, &quot;kids summer holiday break&quot; that's a joke nothing for kids apart from a bag will little duck, duck food, cheap pad and pens. Our rooms were mixed up, kids bed in the wrong room, our room was no better than a cheap b and b, smelt awful, was drab and outdated, we were offered the only other room left and it was worse so we went with the less of 2 evils, we ordered papers that went to the wrong room, we never got them, we had a pile of glasses left outside the room all day, they were still there at night but now had a cloth over them, breakfast next day was awful, we waited at the door to be seated for 10 mins, I then asked a man if we could sit down,&quot; he said I'm busy u have to wait&quot;.. We then waited for tea and coffee for 15 mins, I asked 3 people for toast, got my own in the end, when we wanted more, a lady got it off a table someone had left... Breakfast was Luke warm not hot, mushroom and tomato's were horrible, I asked for some mustard and it came out in a gravy boat filled to the brim. I said I'm not having a bbq, our plates took 30 mins to be taken, not one member of staff smiled and it was chaotic and shambolic. We asked for a late check out so we could go swimming, we were told this was fine, we go to out room at 10.15, are getting ready in the bedroom and a maid comes out the bathroom with cups she was washing, I phoned reception and was told they would get her to leave, but 15 mins later she was still there working round us so we left her to it, we came back from swimming and the maid had made the bed with all our belongings underneath the duvet, arrr. Reception had checked out my daughter and her friend, who is going through chemotherapy instead of us, so there cards never worked, she then goes to reception to get some more cards, these didn't work either, nor did the next set, u dont expect to walk to reception 3 times, least when u are ill, its not on. The grounds are lovely apart from the bridge that has cones instead of a rail, health and safety would have a field day with that. The only excellent part was the library lounge and bar, the staff were brillant and arvis and Daniel were great as were the rest, really made our visit, refreshing after the awful hotel experience, its a shame there work ethic doesn't spill over.. I dont think we will be going back after spending £1000 and getting a bog standard stay... "
-4; We had been away for the weekend and decided to find a spa hotel to treat ourselves to an extra night. Booked that day directly with the hotel. On arrival we were given a room without a window, no assistance to the room and we had to wait 10 mins at reception before we were even acknowledged! then changed the room to one with a window which had a terrible view and a stained carpet. Tried to have a bath and no water came from the taps. By the time we had finished messing about with the room it was too late to use the pool and facilities so we decided to go the following day. That evening we went down to chose one of the restaurants to be told that on a Sunday we had the option of a set menu in the main dining area or the bar food 9this was not mentioned when we booked). Bar staff were helpful but there was no atmosphere and the fact that the hotel was full of people walking around in their dressing gowns was quite off putting. The next day we had breakfast which had it's issues but we were looking forward to spending a few hours using the facilities. we entered the leisure club only to be told that because we were checking out that day, we had to pay to use the facilities! we are regular travellers and have never heard of this before. Upon checking out we advised the staff that our stay had been less than satisfactory and they didn't seem in the least bit interested. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. 
-4; Extremely disappointing stay….. NO HOT WATER – COLD SHOWER! DIRTY CUPS! IGNORED BY STAFF!  I must say the grounds and castle itself are breathtakingly beautiful. Very peaceful and tranquil.   The hotel stay itself turned out be a very disappointing experience. My mother and I stayed the night before my wedding. We woke that morning to find we had no hot water in our room. This was reported to reception and we were told someone would be up to investigate – no one showed! Being on a tight schedule (morning of the wedding) we resorted to having a quick cold shower – certainly not the way I intended to spend the morning of my wedding. And certainly not what you would expect from a four star hotel charging these rates.  A letter of complaint was sent last month to general manager Mr Piers Vowles, and it seems that again I have been ignored. A very poor level of service received by you Amberley Castle!  Mrs D Tricker 
-4; Omg the resturant let's this place down appalling staff and food. Room and Spa first class Aqua fit teacher first class. rest of the staff have an attitude problem . Food is more Iceland than waitrose. 
-4;" I have stayed here before Britannia took over the hotel when is was a good place to take a short break, but not anymore....Check in was laughable. After driving two hours you are met with a woman who is &quot;in training&quot; which meant she just stood there and couldn't do anything.My partner and I stayed for 2 nights 13/14th December. The room was tired and shabby. Clean, comfortable bed though. The pool area was run down and the overall Spa amenities were poor to say the least. There was little in the way of service at the bar of an evening. One over worked young foreign woman who did her best. The breakfast service has gone way down. On Sunday morning the sausages were inedible and would have given me food poisoning, I could not eat them. Tea and Coffee are served in plastic flasks, the really cheap sort, and their contents are of a similar standard.  I will never return. "
-4; I booked late so didnt get into my usual hotel, having stayed in other Hallmark hotels I expected more, severely disappointed and exhausted! Arrived at 11.30 pm waited a while to check in as phone just rang at front desk. Walked into my room which was unbearably hot, there was no adjustment on the bathroom radiator and turning the bedroom radiator off made no difference as faulty. All windows open, central light fan on and desk fan (so obviously aware of problem) made very little difference. I expected it to cool through the night with radiators turning off centrally but oh no, they continue on sauna setting all night, so I got no sleep. The light fan was catching and making lots of noise,road and passing noise with the windows open. The shower was a trickle and the height adjustment wasn't working. The kettle didn't turn off and also faulty. All in all not what I was expecting. Staff polite but manager uninterested as not about when requested to speak to him, still awaiting call back but unlikely to come! Avoid if you want sleep. 
-4; Booked a spa day (£25 each) with friends and was very disappointed in condition of spa and pool-cold water and not very good facilities. Small sauna and steam room.  Couldn't take beverages into pool area and didn't feel very plush or a nice spa experience. Fortunately we all booked a deluxe detox/Destress massage £45 each which was lovely and great service by the spa girls but was highly disappointed that on leaving the hotel we then has to pay for hotel parking. What hotel charges quests for parking in their hotel??!!  Disgraceful service, esp as we had all spent a lot on the spa etc- it really was a cheek!   
-4; Hilton was always a second home during the trips. However this time was extremely disappointing. The Front Office Department - Reception employees are impolite. They completely not maintaining Hilton standards. While I was making a check in there was a call and the lady just picked up the phone and started talking despite the fact that i was just in front of her. Moreover no hospitality, smile, welcoming attitude from even supervisors. Grumpy, rude employees were passing an uncomfortable feelings. The beds in the room creak, the bathroom is too old. Definitely require a refurbishment as well as a carpets on the floor full of dirty spots. Housekeeping left trash, dirty cups of coffee etc.  I will not recommend hotel at all. 
-4;" I am not sure if it's just my age but me and my boyfriend spent a long time looking for a grand hotel in Hyde Park and when we found this perfect hotel, it was far from perfect. To start with we were greeted by a very grumpy, one worded man. Then when we got to our room it was BOILING! we tried to turn off the heating but it was as low as it could go and it also did not help that the window was fake, and was not going to open. when I complained I had a man come to the room and re-repeat everything I did, but he just said &quot;if it does not change in a couple of minutes, then call again and I will be back to have a look&quot;, so I call again after about half an hour and the same man turned up with a small fan, I just said &quot;oh thank you&quot; and poped the fan on the side to be plugged in. I am not kidding, it was like they had taken out all the bolts and screws and placed them in the motor, it was the loudest fan i have ever herd! therefore there was no sleep for me.   p.s. Do not even get me started on the staff, rude, cheeky and constantly on their walky talkys talking in another language, looking over every two dam seconds like they were part of MI5 or something. it just made me feel very uncomfortable..   I hate that I have to put a bad review as the hotel itself is a beautiful building, such a shame about the stay. "
-4; Where do I start!  hotel room wasn't ready.... After 5 hours and at 10pm with 3 kids under 10 we are still waiting for a suitable room. Get moved to cheaper older dated interconnecting rooms where one of the showers didn't work and it wasn't as clean but too tired to complain as its been a long night of complaining, waiting etc.  In the morning complained to duty manager he tried to tell us he could do nothing as we had been given 20% off and free drinks at the bar when they hadn't offered us anything at all and we certainly didn't get free drinks!  When I told him I was unhappy and refused to pay he threatened me Infront of my 3 kids with the police!  Disgusting service.  I've stated in loads of hotels in my time as I work in travel and this hotel has to have the most poor level of hospitality I have ever known 
-4; I had a basement room overlooking a dingy yard housing the main extractor from the kitchen. Dirty towel left on the bathroom floor and blocked washbasin. The bathroom door actually moved one of the single beds when opened. TV remote didn't work, enough coffee provided for 2 cups. Staff were unfriendly, unhelpful, and scary! Continental breakfast was a travesty-tea arrived instead of coffee, but impossible to tell the difference. 
-4; Went here for car very lunch on Monday 14th January. What we got was left overs from the Sunday. Meat was dry and tough and the veg re-heated from the day before. Absolute rubbish  ,not even fit for the dog. Have made a complaint in writing and almost a month later am still waiting for a reply 
-4; I stayed here with my partner and had a dreadfull experience. Would definately not recommend at all. The room was small and dirty, crumbs of food left on worktop in the kitchen, obviously not cleaned and hairs on the bed. Rude staff especially a gent called Paris who was very snobby and when we rang reception to ask if we could change rooms because the nextdoor was full of drunks partying till the early hours of the morning, i was told their was nothing they could do and would have to just hope they quiet down??!! Erm, ever heard of customer service?! Obviously NOT! On the website the pictures look wonderfull ans stylish but this is not the case, very dissappointed and will telling all my family and friends about my experience to save them wasting their money and time. 
-4; We have just returned from a 2 night stay and pleased to be home!  We stayed here as a 'treat' for my husbands 70th birthday. We were accompanied by our King Charles Spaniel as we understood that dogs were welcome at the hotel. However on our arrivals we discovered that dogs were not allowed in any of the public room's which meant we either had to be outside or in the bedroom. Also in the information pack we were told that the dog could not be left in the room unattended- and yet when the stay was booked they took a dinner reservation and a dog reservation which strictly being was not physically possible to do!!  I understand that the reason dogs are not allowed in the public rooms is because food is served in all of them, however food was served outside and dogs were allowed in this area so I am not sure how this can be explained. The dog was charged £25 per night and I was told when I booked that there would be lots of treats for the dog - there was 1 very synthetic chew that I wouldn't recommend any dog eat. We were provided with a dog bed and blanket and 2 ' plastic ' dog bowls. Apart from the dog issue the condition of the hotel is very shabby and not what I would expect from 'luxury' accommadation.  The following are just a few ot the observations that need addressing apart from the shabby furnishings in the public rooms. 1. The outside tables are left every evening just as guests have left them - no tidying took place. 2. The outside tables did not have cushions on the seats or parasols ( these can be seen in the brochure!) 3. The bedroom had a bizaare array of furnishings- cane sofa that would have been more suited to a conservatory setting, very very tired chipped white furniture, traditional lamps pictures etc that didn't connect with the sofa and furniture and a carpet that was very stained 4. The bed was very uncomfortable and I suspect very old with a padded matress topper to try to disguise the fact. 5. The bathroom was lacking any hooks for towels near the shower and the water at best was luke warm. 6. The service was ad hock - although the staff on the whole were very pleasant there was a general feeling that no one was in charge.It often proved difficult to attract attention from the waiters, so this was not very relaxing. I would not recommend this hotel, and I certainly would not say it was luxury.   ,To sum up this hotel doss not deliver what it proports ro delivert on its website or in the brochure and I would suggest that anyone thinks long and hard before paying for such sub standard accommodation.  , 
-4;I payed over £600 for this 3night stay furniture, bed, curtains not nice to look at, looked as if they had been stored in a barn.Food was only fit for the pig bin, staff found it hard to understand you.Reception you would have had better sevice from work experence the only person to work hard was the porter he ran about the place but always had a smile and asked if he could help.My husband lost his leg 3years ago and we have both wanted to see the air tattoo but he is no longer able to stand for long periods so when booking I asked for a balcony, beach facing as I felt he would be able to see the tattoo from the balcony although told yes we can do that madam reception did not agree and sent me off with a flee in my ear. When it was De Vere it was first class now you would get better service at Travel Lodge
-4; 29.9.15 Was booked for midweek break with country music and premium dining starting yesterday. Accommodation O.K. but restaurants and country music venue oversubscribed - to the point where the whole thing was a nightmare. Initially the staff took the line that we had got it wrong etc etc. - this was easily disproved by the length of the queue waiting to complain and indeed GETTING THEIR MONEY REFUNDED. There will probably be plenty of room tonight! We were away from home for 25 hours and that included 5 hours travelling! Avoid the place. 
-4; Very bad Stephen Malvern show was a con was put in a badly infested bug room staff wasn't very helpful took 2 complaints to be eventually moved cocoopops on the floor when we arrived not clean at all everything we went to go swimming pool was full we had to que to and wait to go in.all action passes were a con worked out cheaper if you paid for the activities food was lovely 
-4; Check-in was awful a strange party of people, who were really rude kept pushing in whilst several people waited then there was an issue with our booking.... Had to wait for ages after a busy working day. Had to then lug my own bags up narrow stairs as my room was on the first floor, stairs were filthy and the carpet on the first flow was in a bad state with an assortment of trip hazards... Room again dusty, but seemed ok and as we wanted to get some food just changed and went out for food... The best bit of my visit - receptionist suggested we go to Piccadilly Circus as there are lots of nice places like Jamie's Italian Anyway when I returned there was a strange event going on so I didn't check out the bar area, so headed up to my room. Only then did I see how dirty and in need of a decent vacuum it was, there was a toenail and hair of both types a plenty, if it hadn't been so busy and if I had realised before, I would have asked to change to another room, there is no excuse for a room not being cleaned. My other pet hate I'd when something isn't cleaned because it's a bit hard to do it, there was a gap between the shower cubicle and Tiling so it just hadn't been cleaned.... How about getting a suitable brush for the job...yuck! Also I tried to cool the room but the air con was not working and the windows are sealed up by paint instead of having a lock. Breakfast was fine. Checkout was again a problem and delayed us but apparently that was due to my company's credit card - very odd as I've never had a problem before! I also note I wasn't asked how my stay was but we did get a complimentary taxi.  Ps my colleague also said his room was dirty & watch out for the bathroom door, it only opens partially then stops due to the stupidly placed / inappropriate for the space towel rail, so anyone who is large would struggle. Oh and my last gripe what is the use of a wardrobe that you can't hang a normal dress in? 
-4; I recently bought a spa day as a gift and was very dissatisfied with the day. Although the picture suggested that robe and slippers were supplied they were not. The were only 4loungers and nowhere to relax so we had to sit on metal chairs. The pool was cool and there was nowhere to get a drink other than water although the spa staff were very helpful and after asking if tea coffee were available they went to get it for us. This experience was way down the rating as far as a typical spa day should be and we certainly didn't come out feeling relaxed and refreshed. We had to get dressed to go for lunch and decided that it was not worth going back so our day was cut short. This was a visit to a hotel pool and at £25 for visitors is a very expensive let down. The Marriott chain has a good reputation which is spoilt by such a misrepresentation of what a spa day suggests 
-4; My husband and I have just been to have Afternoon Tea. Due to allergies they 'catered' for me but giving us egg sandwiches which tasted of smoked salmon, a fruit platter with half a dozen strawberries, a few blackberries, melon (which neither my husband and I can eat) and a few red currants. I must admit the scones were quite nice. All this was for BOTH of us. There was another table who had a 'regular' tea with twice as much for £13.50 per head when they charged us £17.10 each. When we spoken to the member of staff (who was scruffy with stains on his shirt and his customer service skills need working on) he just shrugged his shoulders and said 'that's the price'. We will not return and I would not recommend them to anybody  
-4;" To say this hotel was a disappointment would be an understatement! By far the worst hotel i have stayed in... On arrival we went up to our room and walked in to the first problem, the bed... The duvet had been thrown on, it hadn't been tucked in, straightened out, nothing. My partner started to make the bed how it should have been made to find a hole in the bed sheet! After making the bed i lay down to watch tele whilst my partner went in the shower, to find about 2 channels that worked properly... As im watching tele my partner shouts me in the bathroom to show me the writing on the mirror saying &quot;GG was ere&quot; so the mirror in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned. The bathroom itself was disgusting there is mold and dirt between the tiles and an awful smell from the sink with a damp patch under it. The room was filthy the carpet had marks on it the chairs had stains and dirt all over them! It says on the internet there are coffee and tea facilities and mini bar... There was enough coffee for me and my partner to have 1 each and there wasnt a single drink in the mini bar. We went to reception to ask for an upgrade and offered to pay but the lady was disinterested and said she couldnt help us. In the morning we rang reception to have breakfast brought to the room this was an extra £12.00 each... After waiting for 40mins our what only can be discribed an unedible breakfast arrived... The scrambled egg looked like sick the mushrooms tasted like they had been cut up and dumoed on the plate without seeing a pan, the bacon was near on raw and the toast wasnt toasted in the slightest. I rang reception to complain and told them we wouldnt eat this and we will check out and go else where. On check out we informed the man at reception about our disappointment, and how upset we was that we paid good money for a dirty room and a horrific breakfast. To add insult to injury we was refunded £19!! That is disgusting! I strongly advise anyone that wants to visit Birmingham to do so at a different hotel... Bearing in mind there is hundreds more with better standards and lower prices.... "
-4; I stayed here for 4 nights whilst working at media city. It's a horrible hotel, very old and dated, horrible rooms, bathrooms, no gym, on a very busy main road which means you here the hum of traffic all night long!  My bed was comfortable though.  Breakfast was awful! Everything was so cheap, the nastiest cheapest thin stale bread for toast, cheap tasteless everything.   The staff were nice and helpful.  Don't stay here if you have a choice. 
-4; Myself and partner booked the weekend away at Hatherley Manor and were very excited to have a quiet weekend away... That was far from. I'm 21 and my partner is 25 so obviously we don't mind noise but paying £99 a night you expect to have a high standard! There was a wedding present over the weekend we was there which was nice to see however they were based in the lounge which is the only place apart from your room you can go so we we're vacated to our room. Not to mention party music playing till 3am and listening to next doers toilet flushing and above us bonking like rabbits. The rooms were filthy, the bathroom floor obviously wasn't swept the toilet seat had chipped marks all on it and the bedroom pillows were flat and full of dust. The food was average nothing amazing and on our last morning we went for breakfast to find there was no where for is to sit and no staff to speak to about it. I just wanted to get out of there by this point, reception woman was really nice and wanted to help, we we're told we would get a 38.50 refund which covered the extra we paid for a 'better' room. They couldn't refund us there because the card machine was 'playing up' but said they would sort it and the money would be into our account. 1 week later still no refund, rang them twice requesting the small refund and still waiting now. There is no pool, sauna or anything and if there is a wedding there should be a seperate function area to the main area where other visitors may want to relax. I've stayed at the premier inn for better comfort, service and value for money! Real disappointment!!! 
-4; I booked a room with Novotel BirminghamAirport on Tuesday March 17 for my husband and received Booking Confirmation as an added precaution as his expected arrival time would be around 12-30 am this morning a telephone call was also made to confirm this fact,he arrived to find no room,staff helped him round to in his words to an inferior hotel, he walks with a stick and of course had luggage,someone collected him this morning and walked him back to Novotel for the included Breakfast,the whole idea of booking at the Novotel was its easy access to Birmingham Airport Arrivals. Very Disappointed with this treatment.,how bad would this have appeared to a Visitor to Great Britain,either on Business or at the start of a Holiday? 
-4; My Partner and I love our little getaways and have always tried to make the best of whatever little faults there may be. This place we just couldn't. Blood stains on our duvet, headboard and chair. Cobwebs and dust everywhere. Very poor spa staff. Such a shame because nearly all the staff we spoke to, were new, so it would seem the transient workforce has impacted the hotel very negatively.   The weekend spend was £619.25 and after complaining we were refunded £122.70 so basically we paid nearly £500 for 2 nights at a hotel we couldn't wait to leave it was that bad we were supposed to stay until 4pm in the spa on Sunday but we left right after breakfast. If you would be happy with that then by all means enjoy. 
-4; Stayed in a deluxe King room last weekend and we were given a disappointingly small room with a tiny shower room, with marble walls and flooring.Shower door was broken and folded inwards into the shower and could not be closed properly. Was showering when door started to fold into shower and I slipped trying to push it away. Fell badly trying to avoid hitting my head and sustained six bruises over my legs and a large 10cm diameter contusion over my left thigh. Could not get out of shower as floor was very slippery from water leaking from broken door base and shower tray slippery from shampoo. Needed help from husband to get up and out of shower and had to put towels on floor to get enough grip.Hotel staff seemed not to understand the gravity of what had happened and when we asked to change room we were told none available and that shower would be fixed. Shower not sorted out and had to call on-duty manager 7 hours later to complain. Maintenance man could not fix shower properly as he did not have the parts. On-duty manager made an incident report but no attempt to offer a better room with a safer shower or waiver of some of the room costs.Only got us extra towels to prevent slipping and a bath mat ...a bit belatedly. Paid full price for room when checking out and the morning duty manager not aware of these events. No formal apology for what was a serious health and safety issue and potentially a legal matter.Sent email to hotel about incident - no reply. Have since had to consult a medical colleague about severe bruising which is making sitting and walking difficult and will be seeing a solicitor about injuries.Am a doctor myself and am aware of health and safety laws and occupiers liability act 1957 in terms of personal injury. Attitude of staff dealing with this incident was shockingly laid back, incompetent and lacking compassion.Spoiled our initial experience of the night reception and concierge staff when we first arrived,who were very helpful and polite.  I have noted other reviewers comments about the small and badly designed bathrooms in this hotel and wonder how many others have had falls etc ...  Not a four star hotel as far as I am concerned as they do not seem to care about the safety of  their occupiers who are paying customers. 
-4; Booked this as its near my new office in Manchester, Salford Quays. Sadly didn't read reviews! To say this hotel is tired is an understatement. The price reflects a city centre classier hotel e.g. Malmaison (where I will be going next time). Rooms are like something out of the 70's with psychedelic tiling in the bathroom, a hairdryer that looks more like a home colonic irrigation machine (probably would be more useful!) and dodgy furniture. Arrived at 8.30pm. Very friendly, efficient receptionist so I was lulled into a false sense of security. 8.45 I discovered the photocopied room service menu(!) after being scarred by the sight of the bathroom. Rang 5 times, not answered. Rang reception (by this time they'd obviously changed staff as this lady kept apologising for not being able to read her own handwriting and got confused what a cranberry was!). 1.5 hours wait for a panini so I cancelled and went to bed in a huff with a biscuit. Still in a huff in the morning so didn't bother with breakfast so can't comment on that, I'm sure it was divine...... 
-4; To start with, i will say that the hotel looks lovely. It has some gorgeous features from the reception through to the inside lobby and first impressions are impressive. but that is, i'm afraid, where the grandeur ends. My husband had been awed by the websites photographs of the facilities and rooms but having seen them first hand, all i can say is what a clever photographer they used as we were less than impressed with the reality!! We had booked the garden room as a late availability...what a mistake! it was stuck away from the main hotel with no garden view, just a view of the tennis courts behind the rest of the occupants parked cars. The room was dirty with a hair on the side of the bath and dust hanging in strings from the ceiling. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We didn't even last the night and left after 3hrs. The manager was apologetic and did say he'd had a cancellation for a sea-view room so would be happy to upgrade us and also said that when we made the booking online, a member of staff should have given us a courtesy call to explain the location of the room and to check we were happy to continue with the booking but we didn't receive that either. Overall feeling was that we felt cheated and tricked by clever photography and false promise. Maybe we have been spoilt by the other 4* hotels we have stayed at, or maybe it was just a one off bad experience as looking at other reviews other travellers have had a lovely experience but we wont be returning as it simply wasn't for us. 
-4;stay away if you have an allergy or would like a geniune afternoon tea experience.  The sandwiches are dry around the edges, as though they had been sitting out for a while a piece of plastic was found on one of the cakes, clearly not made on site! The scones (one each only) looked and tasted shop bought Only one round of tea included-in the 10 other hotels I have been too this one is the only one that charges for more tea! Some of the cakes look as though they have been nibbled at before hand around the edges...presentation is clearly not key for the Crown Plaza. AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY. I called to advise I had a walnut and pecan allergy when I booked. Then I called on the day to confirm (not that they could find my booking!) so I advised again about my allergy. When we got there I advised the waiter that I had an allergy. They cakes that came out looked as though they had walnuts in so I asked the waiter to check with the kitchen, who confirmed NO NUTS. After dissecting the cake more I asked the waiter to check again with the kitchen....and came back very apologetic to say that they were infact walnuts and that I would be fine to eat the other cakes...which wasn't possible as the cake was touching other cakes. Then, to top it off, I was made to feel as though I was making a fuss about nothing when I complained! I would NEVER go here again!
-4; When we arrived, we were surprised to find the reception was not on the ground floor and were pulling on various doors until we found one which opened. When we found reception, we were asked to fill in our forms and so we were having a chat whilst doing so. We felt very uncomfortable when asked to lower our volume, as we didn't feel like we were very loud at all.  We were disappointed to find the thermal suite was lacking in facilities, it didn't have a jacuzzi or swimming pool (we hadn't double checked beforehand, as we thought all good spas had such facilities).  They forgot to call us for lunch, and then one of our party was unable to eat with us as she had to wait a very long time for a replacement vegetarian lunch to arrive.  The relaxation room was not big enough, and when we weren't sharing loungers, we couldn't even get in there at all!  My treatment was fantastic though, and I could not fault the friendliness and professionalism of the girl who did my pedicure.  Finally, a mix up with the payment meant that one of our party was completely overcharged, without her knowledge, and then her refund took more than 2 weeks and lots of chasing before it was processed.  We will not be going back to this disorganised spa. A good spa needs more than just great treatments, it is the whole package we are looking for.  I did not stay at the hotel, so cannot comment on that. 
-4; We booked Cannizaro House afternoon tea as it is a 4 star hotel and we were expecting it to be a 'fabulous treat' as stated on their website - it was not. Firstly the tea is served in the lounge which is essentially the reception of the hotel so not even in the restaurant. On arrival our party of nine was seated around two very small tables, there was not enough room on the table for our tea cups, plates and serving trays. When the food arrived there was enough sandwiches (which were cut into very thin fingers) for us to have two/three each so we need them replenished immediately - it took them about ten minutes to bring more, when the waitress arrived with the sandwiches she had no utensil to put them onto the serving trays on the table so I had to use my fingers to pick them up and place them on the trays.... We had ordered various teas and some coffee - no spoons were provided so we had to ask for some, this took about another ten minutes so in the mean time we had to use our knives to stir our drinks. For nine people we were given one small jug of milk which ran out very quickly so we had to ask again for this to be replenished. We were given two small dishes of cream and jam for the scones, this was enough for about two people so again we had to ask for more. We essentially spent the whole time asking for things to be replenished and then waiting for ten - fifteen minutes for it to arrive.  The food itself is distinctly average - although it is very hard to get egg mayonnaise and cucumber sandwiches wrong.   When we were given the bill at the end we had been charged for three servings of coffee - I had to ask twice for this to be removed.  There was a 10% service charge added to the bill which in retrospect I wish I had asked for this to be removed as I found the level of service completely shocking.  All in all there are far better places to have afternoon tea and for much better value. 
-4; My fiancé and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago as we were meeting friends in Oxford. What a shambles! The bathroom door didn't fit the gap properly so couldn't be closed, the shower head didn't stay up on it's pole and the cups were covered in old tea leaves. Worse than this however was the unhelpfulness of the staff. When we arrived they took pre-authorisation on a debit card but when we went to cash point later in the evening it turned out they had frozen a lot more money than they should have done leaving my partner unable to take out cash. We flagged this up at reception but they didn't have a solution or anyone we could discuss it with. It eventually took a week and a half before the money was released. We will not be returning! 
-4; In all probability this is the worst hotel I have stayed in.   There were many things wrong with this hotel but I think the worst issue was the fact there was no luggage room. We arrived early and asked if we could store our luggage till the room was ready. They said they couldn't store the luggage but could let us have the room early for an extra fee!! Even worse when leaving - we had a flight in the evening and wanted to sightsee without dragging our cases round London. We were told they had nowhere to store our luggage so we then had to make our way to one of the stations where we had to pay an exorbitant fee to store our cases. I have stayed in a countless number of hotels and have never encountered this major inconvenience.   We booked a twin room. The two beds were around two feet wide and no where near the usual single bed size. There were no drawers/tables at either side of the bed and no wardrobe!! The shower was no more than a trickle and no fresh hand towels given out on the second day despite the fact we left the dirty ones on the floor. There were two thin plastic cups in the bathroom but again were never replaced. There was no hairdryer in the room.  I wouldn't advise anyone to stay here and especially if you are arriving early or leaving late. The rate we were charged may have been a bit less than the surrounding hotels in the area but by the time you add the extra charges to the hotel, tube tickets, left luggage fees there isn't much difference. Also due to the lack (or absence) of any amenities in the room it would be impossible to comply with restricted luggage weight allowances when hairdryers or toiletries are not available on arrival and you have to come prepared.  So glad to leave this place and relieved our stay was only for two nights. 
-4; I visited Wood Hall as part of a Spa day. Upon arrival we were rudely advised by a gentleman member of staff, who ran out of the hotel, (clearly he had been watching & waiting to pounce on such people) we could not park outside the hotel as it was booked for an exclusive wedding. A sign was then put in front of the main car park entrance advising that it was closed, I would advise this is done in future before guests arrive and I would advise the gentleman in question is taught some manners, rather than being full of his own self importance. The Spa itself is beautiful and the treatments were brilliant. Unfortunately though during the afternoon when we sat down to eat our cream tea whilst enjoying the beautiful scenery there was a black & white spaniel roaming the grounds and it proceeded to defecate just a few metres from the spa entrance. As we watched in dismay the same gentleman who advised us to move our car earlier in the day stood and watched the dog & never cleaned its mess up or contacted the owner to remove the mess. The dog was clearly known to the gentleman as it kept following him as he wandered around the front of the hotel wagging its tail. When we left the spa much later the mess was still present. I find this lack of care an utter disgrace and expected much better from the hotel staff. Even if the dog didn't belong to someone at the hotel the fact the mess was left is disgusting, I'm sure the hotel cameras would also have seen this happening and again they also chose to ignore it. 
-4; I booked this hotel for my mothers 80th birthday celebration back in July for her party on the 8th sept. They gave me 4 hours notice to say they had doubled booked us. They tried to give us a conference room which quite honestly looked like on old folks day room and was insulting. I even asked the receptionist and manger that was on duty if they would like that for their mother's birthday, they both replyed no. Enough said.  With half an hours notice I switched location to the Milford Hall Hotel who dried my tears and were throughly amazing. I can't praise them enough. Obviously its all about the money and they could earn more from the funeral party that was clearly booked AFTER my booking than from us. 
-4; Met friends at Forest Pines Hotel for a Cream tea in the conservatory on Friday 28th June. Cups and saucers were not matching and the cups were thick and more suited to a transport cafe. Saucers were given to us to use as side plates. When I pointed this out, the waiter said he didn't realise he had brought saucers and brought side plates, not what you would call four star service. The scones were huge, absolutely no finesse about this cream tea, not what you would expect from a four star hotel. An extremely disappointing experience. 
-4;" The Scillies are beautiful, and well worth a visit - this was our fourth time there (for the gig rowing World Championships held in May). These islands are the most peaceful and beautiful place in the world. You can't buy atmosphere, ambience and tranquility, wherever else you may go in the world to try to find it.  This was our first time at the Star Castle and we were rather disappointed. We booked over 2 months in advance, early Feb. We had a package where flights from Newquay were included. Two nights and 2 return flights came to £800. (If you book flights direct, they're about £150 per person, which makes the room about £500, or £250 a night (Dinner B&B)). We were therefore expecting a high quality experience, and although the communal areas were nice (quite gothic and atmospheric) we were in a very small, cramped, dark room, with very small windows, and sloped ceilings - as we were put on the top floor. My partner being 6'4&quot; obviously struggled with this! The bed was also very small - a standard double rather than the king-sized bed you should expect in a high-quality expensive hotel. Don't come for a romantic break! We didn't get a wink of sleep.  The garden rooms look a bit brighter and are a nicer more seasidey decor (judging from the website) but are outside of the main castle so you would lack that &quot;castle&quot; vibe if that's what you're seeking.  On the positive side, the food here is exceptional. There is a lovely fish restaurant in the conservatory with a rambling vine growing through the window and over the ceiling, absolutely stunning location and food to match. They brought me the wrong fish dish one night, but I was quite happy with it nonetheless! I would highly recommend the restaurant.  If you go to the Scillies, I'd recommend staying in a B&B or in of the lovely Duchy cottages (where we escaped to for nights 3 and 4 of our holiday!) They don't come cheap, but they're a world apart from the dingy and over-priced Star Castle. Very disappointing... "
-4; We treated ourselves to a break in london and staying at what we thought was a nice hotel. The staff were lovely, but the hotel's facade is a bit dated compared to the new hotel next door. The location is great, food ok,, but,..... i think our room had bed bugs. eww. We'd asked for a cot which didn't arrive and even if it had there was no room for it (even in a junior suite) so my 1 year old slept in the same bed as me and we both woke up the next day with bites. Not great, the hotel has said it checked the room afterwards and found nothing, but even 6 days later my daughter still has raised bumps/ bite marks. 
-4; We stayed at this hotel for one night. We had a very inferior meal. During the night it became to hot I opened the window in the bedroom to get some air. I could not close it again it was noisy with the window closed but OPEN it was like sleeping in the middle of the M 1 ..dreadful . Breakfast was ridiculously expensive all we had was a one piece of toast . And a cereal . The tea was cold . No pot just a cup with a tea bag .. Never again. 
-4; I booked dinner for Sunday 12 July for six, including two who had travelled from America for my daughter's wedding which mercifully was not held in your hotel. I had booked four of them into the hotel for the night of Sunday 12 July. First, the booking for the dinner table, which I made at midday today, was not put through to the the restaurant. They said there was no space, even though the restaurant was clearly almost deserted, (wonder why) but they eventually decided to accommodate us in the the dire and empty place. My husband's steak was thin and meagre and the bearnaise sauce so vinegary that it was inedible. Deciding on deserts for five of us and cheese for one, we waited and waited, We eventually gave up after over half an hour. When we remonstrated with the waitress she just looked blank. We were there for nearly three hours and no one could manage to get us deserts that didn't need cooking or a platter of cheese.We eventually got so annoyed we just walked out, and guess what. No one cared. The same monoglot waitress just smiled blankly. She was French, I speak French, but she refused to communicate, probably trained by the MacDonald chain on the lines of 'let them complain, don't explain, if they don't like the service then it doesn't matter as there will be plenty more punters tomorrow.'  Like a dud apple, Alveston Manor looks great on the outside but isn't much cop on the inside. I am deeply embarrassed for my American cousins who travelled all the way from Spokane WA, some 7,000 miles, to stay at your hotel. Amazingly dreadful service.  It might have been a Sunday when it could be difficult to find staff who speak English or are capable of conveying a simple desert course to six people in an almost empty restaurant, but I was there with my relations to enjoy a relaxed dinner, having just yesterday managed to pull off the best wedding of the year for my daughter. No one had to wait that long for their pudding then, and I am not a restaurateur. Also we we fed over 100. So get a grip!  Meanwhile, I would advise Trip Advisor readers to find somewhere other than Alveston Manor in Stratford-upon-Avon. It really isn't that great. 
-2; We booked the Topham's hotel on a special occasion, and were looking forward to it. The hotel looks lovely -boutique style, rooms look nice, staff friendly... But scratch that surface, and you come across small rooms, a bed so soft you sink in it sitting down, a cold bathroom (made of old beautiful stones but not thought through for cold winters), a restaurant that although serving nice food, feels more like a cantine and doesn't serve alcohol (nor does the bar?)... And the little things that make a difference... are non-existent: bathroom products are limited, only one toilet paper roll, tea but no milk, etc... Being familiar with 3 to 5* hotels, one can safely say that this one is far overrated, way overpriced -prices of a 4*- for really what overall is just about a 2*, despite its lovely looks. Thankfully we went on a special deal... 
-2; All other staff we came across were lovely and the building and rooms are absolutely gorgeous, but there is one receptionist that has such an attitude as to sour your entire impression of the place - what a shame!  I'm afraid I did not catch her name, but avoid like the plague and you should be fine. Dark bobbed hair, looks very unhappy and angry with her life, I'd direct questions elsewhere, as her responses are officious, defensive and off-putting.  I also got the impression there is rather a bitter rivalry with other local businesses which is a bit of a red flag - not sure I'd trust any recommendations to be unbiased and accurate.   Don't get me wrong, I've nothing at all against a bit of healthy competition, but I don't think there's any need for it to be bitter or for any bad-mouthing.  So, go forth and enjoy, its a gorgeous place, its just let down by the receptionist. 
-2; Went here for a birthday weekend however the location isn't great as we couldn't find any restaurants or bars nearby. It was very noisy when we were trying to sleep as there was loud music playing until late at night. There is also limited parking so we had to park on the main road. The standard bedroom is tiny. Really disappointing and overpriced for what it is. 
-2; This hotel is shabby & in need of refurnishing. Our room was on the 3rd floor, very small & poorly furnished with thin sheets that had holes in & a horrible brown blanket! We had requested twin beds but were given a double & the very surly duty manager refused to change our room. The lifts were not working. The car park is very small. The window in our room would not shut & the handle broke off when we tried to close it to shut out the noise from the disco which went on til past midnight. The walls are very thin & we could hear EVERYTHING from the couple in the next room during the night. The bar was in need of extra staff to clear dirty glasses etc from the all the tables. The room was small & dingy. Thankfully we were only staying the one night & we would never go there again. This is NOT a 4* hotel & can only assume that some of the reviews posted have been complied by the staff! We visited on the 13th September & the only reasonable comment I can make is that the breakfast was OK & it is 10 mins from the beach & town centre. 
-2;as we arrived outside the grand i was very upset when the door men did not come to walk us into the grand's reception area. when we got to the reception the recepetionist told us where to go and did not show us. apon arriving in the room the seating was not set out well as people had to stretch to get to there drinks and some people were pushed out at the end becasue of the long seating arrangment. we could not take our coats off as i was so cold in there we were all shivering. we asked the waiteer numerous of times to turn the heating on or up and he came and put a little heater behind us that was bearly throwing out any heat.  then it came to ordering our afternoon tea. we were asked what we wanted and then the waited got our orders wrong so some people ended up with things they didnot want so we had to change and the staff were very rude about this. they huffed and puffed as they took away our food. my mum had taken some confety to put on the table and that was no where to be seen and she has still not rceived it back after asking for it nurmerous of times. i think that the service of the waiters was appaling and that my birthday had been ruined a little by this as i was very much looking forward to afternoon tea ta the grand when all i got was a few scones and some orange juice and rude manners. i can assusre you i will not be returing here and i will nto wasting my money here again.
-2; My husband and I stayed here for our wedding anniversay and were really excited as the photos of the hotel looked fab, and when we arrived the front of the hotel also looked fab, but this was soon too deflate us! The front part of the hotel which is the old part, is full of character and used for wedding and corporate meetings etc. but then the majority of the hotel is behind this which is a modern add on which is quite characterless and rather travellodgey! Our room was nice enough, it was 'comtempary', with all the usual modern fittings and decor, the spa area was a real disappointment, the sauna and steam room were dirty and small, the jacuzzi was small, and the pool was freezing, so cold i wouldnt get in! There was also a kids swimming lesson going on in the pool with some tyrrant ranting on and on at the kids which wasnt relaxing at all! The trouble is with this place that instead of leaving the pool/spa area for hotel guests only they have sold external 'gym memberships' to bring in extra business which ruins it for hotel guests. We ate at the hotels restaurant on the evening which was very poor, the service was v.slow and we had to wait at least 10minutes before being acknowledged! The food was okay., The breakfast was a different matter, it was lovely, with older staff who were very attentive and nothing was too much bother, shame the youngsters of the night before hadnt been taught by these experienced staff! I wouldnt recommend this hotel and unfortunately wont visit again. 
-2; We booked quite a while in advance for a room the whole family would share as it was only one night and we would only be there a few hours so we shared a suitcase. When we arrived late at night we were told that there was no such rooms outside of America which was rather difficult, after an hour of waiting we were given two rooms but on separate floors so that the children were on a different floor from us and we had to split our belongings- rather dissapointing. As compensation we were given a pot of cookies which was kind although they contained nuts and failed to mention it to us. Also the parking fees are extortionate. The breakfast was nice and the room was good but we were disappointed in the service and the organisation. 
-2; The young guy left my endless coffee with no milk and as he didn't come near nor by had to go and find my own milk . Didn't get offered any more coffee so a one off larger cup would have worked out better .  Crispy bacon was wet and sloppy . Streaky bacon at its worst . . Not very authentic . It was the lack of interest that really offended though and staff were not busy at all . I can't work out why they are so miserable . It is a nice environment to work in .  Asked if everything was ok at the end I said ' crispy bacon was soggy ' and he didn't respond at all !  Not at all an American experience but toilets immaculate and venue lovely .  Not a one off as since going my friends have said they had the same experience .  Could be so good if they hired a good chef and hired staff that appreciate a job .  Is this why most restaurants hire foreign staff as they know how to be hospitable ! 
-2;" My friend and I went for a Pick'n'mix 25 spa day here and whilst I already had my expectations lower than a real spa, I was still disappointed. Firstly I should say the actually treatment and spa area (as small as it was) was lovely, no complaints there. We then were shown through to the pool area, which since this isn't an exclusive spa was full of other users and kids, but I had thought this might be the case. The whirlpool has cleaning intervals so you are having to get in and out a lot. The steam room and sauna were great and the pool is a good length to swim in (when there are less families in there). Again changing rooms are clean and suitable.   Our deal included &quot;afternoon tea&quot; also, so we went and collected our voucher and went to enjoy a nice lunch...I wish. You go to the wetherspoons-esk pub and ask for your drinks, I don't like hot drinks so asked to swap my tea for a soft drink, I was told I wasn't allowed to do this, it was tea or water. Because I'm sure soda fountain lemonade costs them oh so much money! Then our food arrived, just awful, it was one very small side plate, with stale cold finger sandwiches with fillings like on a school trip, a still basically frozen fruit scone (no option for plain scone) with a sachet of jam similar to what you get with toast and some whipped cream, not clotted. Also a small square of what I assume was lemon drizzle. It was awful, disappointing and not at all worth what we spent.   In fact the price is a really issue, I looked up the prices of each of the items individually and it actually comes to LESS than what we paid for our &quot;spa deal&quot;. I would strongly recommend against a visit to this spa unless you are buying just what you need and have lowered your expectations to a suitable level.  Note: I did contact village urban with this feedback and received no reply. "
-2;"My boyfriend and I booked Grand Royale at Hyde Park for three nights. However, upon arriving in London we received a message saying that due to &quot;maintenance issues&quot; at the hotel our booking was moved to a &quot;four star&quot; sister hotel, Shaftesbury Premier Hotel. While checking in at reception, an American girl next to us was receiving a refund as the room she had been given smelled like sewerage…   We optimistically carried on and got our room key. Fortunately, the room did not smell like sewerage. Unfortunately it was a ridiculously small room/toilet which cost us the same amount as the stay at our CHOSEN hotel would have been. We decided to laugh about it and not complain or move hotel (regret) however as soon as we tried to do anything in the room e.g. get changed or ready in the morning, we struggled due to the size of the room. The double bed was against the wall so I had to jump over my boyfriend to get out of bed and as there was 0 space for anything, I couldn't go out the bottom of the bed as that was the only space I could put my suitcase. There was nowhere in the toilet to put my tooth brush for goodness' sake - so the floor had to do. There was just absolutely no room for doing anything and it was entirely uncomfortable. Another annoyance was caused by the fact the mirror in front of the tiny little desk was so high up that I couldn't sit down to blow dry my hair… so I had to try and move the chair back into a very un-spacious area behind to stand and do it. It was just really uncomfortable.   The complimentary breakfast was fine, but nothing to write home about.   I would not recommend this hotel unless it is only for one night and you are alone."
-2; We booked two deluxe rooms for one night stay at the in Park Grand Hyde Park Hotel and on the day of arrival we was told due a technical issue we was being moved to The Shaftsbury Premier...the hotel seemed very nice and they offered us complimentary breakfast as a gesture.. Once we arrived at our rooms, one was ok but the other so SO SO small, due to my size the other party with us took the room as I couldnt even gain entry to the room without turning sides ways, I couldnt get round the bed on either side, and due to health issues wouldn't be able to shimmy up the bed to get into in! Not that I thought I would ever have too...there was just no floor room...as we were running late for a concert we basically made due for the one night but how they expected you to manage any longer or with mobility issues I do not know!! The other disappointment was that the window looked out onto to wall...why they even bothered with a window I do not know!!!  Would we book again?? Never...you couldn't risk getting one of the stupidly small rooms.. I know space in cities is at a premium but to be moved and crammed into this tiny room was really not nice! What made us laugh was, when I expalined when booking out how disappointed we had been with the room for what it cost us, the receptionist basically said we should consider ourselves lucky as they have smaller rooms!!! I'm thinking they've obviously kitted out the broom cupboard with a double bed, as it would amaze me how a double room could be smaller!! Must be bunk beds I suppose... 
-2; We had booked a vegetarian picnic in the grounds of this hotel for 1.00pm, plus a child's picnic. As requested we had booked 24 hours in advance. However, when I came to collect the picnic at about 1.10pm, the kitchen appeared unaware of the order and I was told to come back in 10 minutes. The picnic finally arrived at 2.15, but when we unpacked it, the started was a 'mediteranean pasta' containing tuna! My husband took the pasta back only to be told that many guests who were vegetarian ate tuna (??) and what would we like instead. Not only this the child's picnic had not been included so we had two hungry and rather grumpy children to contend with. Having said all this, the staff behind reception were very kind and lent us umbrellas and gave us some complementary wine, but there is no excuse really for a picnic arriving an hour and 15 minutes later than expected and then the kitchen staff not providing what had be ordered. Plus, I have to say, if they have a gardener they should be sacked. The grounds are extensive but very unimaginative and even the grass hadn't been cut!! 
-2; I was expecting something reasonably amazing from this hotel, and I sure didn't get it, when my partner and I got into the room, the bed was split into two, and when they eventually put them together the mattresses still seperated and we ended up having to seperate, the staff werent bothered, and the food was average at best. WILL NOT BE STAYING THERE NOW 
-2; Visited with my mum and for what I paid for the hotel was very disappointed. Firstly I had to pay a £50 deposit to ensure no damages was done I was told this would be refunded up to two weeks it's been three weeks and I still have no refund. I found the staff to be quite rude and un helpful was not told about breakfast, the pool or any other facilities. The rooms were nice but was very limited on plug sockets. The staff from the breakfast restaurant was rude and to charger £17 odd pound of a breakfast was ridiculous I was told only my mum could eat in there as I didn't want anything. Overall I think it was overpriced after paying £4.50 for a pasty and £26 for two drinks? Wouldn't visit again. 
-2;" Arrived at the Hotel early evening to what can best be described as a quite rowdy &quot;nice but dim Tim&quot; convention. No offer of help with baggage or where Amy facilities were. Room was average and quite small, the bathroom a joke. It was small, the tiling on the floor was coming away and the toilet roll holder had to be shoulder barged every time you used the toilet! Couldn't bare the noise and ignorance of guests in the bar so had to go out for dinner. The breakfast in the morning was a disaster we waited 45 mins and then the tiny offering on the plate was freezing cold. The second attempt wasn't much warmer but by then had given up. Avoided the hotel till the guests from hell had left for their wedding and then used the spa which was nice but very small and pool cold. The place was deserted in the evening no guests no atmosphere. The dinner menu very dull and uninspiring. The reception seemed to manned by the local WI and the rest of the staff European. I understand the Hotel cannot account for the standard of guests but we should of been advised that there would be a large wedding party taking over the place for the weekend so we could of delayed our trip. This hotel does not come cheap but I'm afraid the rooms,service and general ambience do. What a complete let down. "
-2; Attended their New York themed Christmas do Saturday 21st December. First the good - you enter via a 10 metre snowy grotto like entrance - the aim being to set the Christmas mood. Bags are searched before you go through a lounge area with large, leather sofas and into a huge room which is beautifully decorated. The walls are black with tiny star like lights, there is a mini Statue of Liberty, and projected films on the front wall of US street scenes, pop films etc. The tables were circular with a rotating centre on which was a lit up New York yellow cab. Very festive. There were over 200 people in the room.  The disco was excellent - a great mix of music which appealed to all ages, we could have danced to 80% of the songs. The casino and games marquee was great fun if a little chilly. The bad - even by large scale catering Christmas meal standards, the food was poor. Stone cold, tasteless. The sweet, New York cheesecake, was the highlight of the meal.  The organisers were so keen to make money they didn't care how drunk people got. One chap dropped his trousers and pants, someone else was sick on the main route to the dancefloor, another drunk, female, insisted on showing everyone her thong and I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of babies weren't conceived on that dancefloor - lovely! They didn't care that people took their drinks onto the dancefloor, as a consequence the floor was covered in sticky, spilt alcohol - it's only by luck that a glass didn't get broken. I've not been to a venue in recent years which has allowed drinks on the dancefloors - for very good reason. We won't be returning. 
-2;"It is now almost a year since we held our wedding reception at Kings Croft Hotel and Im still very upset about our experience. Firstly the good stuff; Grounds are beautiful and make for spectacular photos, food was lovely. Initial meetings on run up to wedding (and paying for it) trouble free but sadly thats where it all ends :-( The negatives; Members of our wedding party were spoken to in a rude manner by staff whilst waiting for us the bride and groom to arrive from church. It was unfortunately raining on arrival and I had been informed by staff, prior to the wedding, that if the weather was poor my guests could use the bar area to wait. Granted I did have a large wedding party but Kings croft were fully aware of this as I did pay per head! I was mortified when I arrived to find my guests had been ushered into our reception room which was laid for the wedding breakfast before I had even arrived! Every other wedding venue I have attended have routinely shown the bride and groom their room before any guests were . Then to my horror I found that my table plan (which again had previously been agreed with Kings Croft) had been changed without my permission or even simply making me aware. Therefore family who should have been seated on the front row were instead sat at the back of the very large Kings suite. I was mortified. Only 4 or 5 tables of guests out of 10 tables felt included at our reception and could hear any of the speeches. We were told by the toastmaster, before he announced us into the room, that we would be provided with a mic to prevent this, but the mic never appeared. On to the evening reception... considering there were two weddings at the same time the venue was understaffed to say the least. My cake was taken away and fully cut up without me knowing about it and in the process the staff LOST my personalised cake topper and crystal brooch decorations which really upset me (these have never been found). On to the rooms : Months before the wedding I booked several rooms for family...at full price. I specifically booked a bungalow room for a member of family who had just had a knee replacement and couldn't climb stairs at all (there is no lift in the building) I confirmed this booking every meeting yet on check in it transpired the bungalow had been given to a member of the other wedding party. The only room offered was of course a painful stair climb away. I also specifically booked a double room with cot, however on check in the room allocated was so small no cot could fit in and the baby had to sleep in a pram ALL Night. And finally, when we came down to breakfast the following morning (approx 8.30am) I was horrified to find the Kings suite had already been stripped of all our belongings and gifts in preparation for that days wedding. I understand there are time restrictions but our belongings were literally piled in a corner with no pre warning from staff. On checking out we didn't even get a 'congratulations' from any member of staff which I found quite upsetting. They made us feel like we had had our turn at the wedding machine now it was done and dusted. I did write to the manager with all the above information and more, I sent it recorded delivery so I know it was received, yet we have never received ANY form of communication back not even a simple apologetic phone call to apologise for 'loosing' my belongings. This venue is beautiful and could be an outstanding venue with the right staff, sadly they let us down. However I had previously attended smaller weddings here that seemed to run ok."
-2; We chose to visit the crooked inn for a meal on our son's birthday as we had had a very pleasant meal here 19 months previously and as we're not local it seemed like a good option as it was near to where we were staying. When we arrived we were made to feel very welcomes and were informed of which dishes weren't available. We chose a table in the conservatory so we could keep an eye on our children in the play area outside.  The first surprising instance happened when we asked to set up a tab and the girl behind the bar asked to keep our payment card. Obviously banks advise you never to let your card out of your sight so this was unacceptable - we decided to pay and would pay for any extras afterwards. Our orders were delivered to our table in a reasonable amount of time and all seemed fine. My mother and I ordered from the specials board - the honeyed duck breast with watercress salad and sautéed potatoes sounded delicious! When it arrived I was surprised that it was a salad dish as it had sounded like a breast of duck with sautéed potatoes and a side salad rather then a salad with a bit of duck and potatoes. On closer inspection my salad contained 3 small slices of duck which seemed a little unreasonable for a £15+ price tag for what was essentially a bowl of watercress salad. I complained to the waiter and he went to speak to the chef only to return to tell me that the chef had put 1 breast on each of the salads and that as I'd already started eating it there was nothing he could do. We were really shocked by this attitude and asked to speak to the manager. A few minutes later the waiter returned to tell us that the chef would cook me another breast and he would bring it out as soon as it was ready. Eventually this arrived bearing no resemblance to the duck on either my mum's or my salad but I have to say it was very tasty. The food itself, whilst overpriced, was very nice it was just a pity that the staff's attitude that I must be lying let them down. Sadly I would think twice about returning here - we would have had more drinks and probably desserts but we didn't really feel inclined to give them any more of our money. Shame. 
-2; We bought a groupon voucher for a Garra Fish pedicure costing £45.00 each, to include a day pass for the spa, which at the time seemed reasonable.  The spa from the outside looks a bit like a motorway service station, quite modern and clean but not much character.  The fish treatment was amusing, but as you have to sit up on boxes with the fish tank beneath you are dangling your legs, which I found very uncomfortable. I also cant see any particular benefits, I would much prefer a 'human' pedicure.  There was very little else to warrant spending a day there, unless you wanted to spend lots more money on other treatments.  The pool area is small and very noisy when the pool jets are going, and if someone starts up the power plate too it's deafening. Its not very relaxing if you want to lie and read a book.   The outside hot tub area is very noisy as you can hear the traffic noise from the busy road, so again not a great place to relax.  Two small luke warm hot chocolates cost us £5.00.  All in all not a great experience and certainly not value for money. 
-2; Although we could see from a map that this place is on a dual carriage way, we didn't realise just how noisy it would be. I think if you have a room at the back it is probably OK but we were at the front and the constant traffic, lorries and occasionally a police car, meant we got no sleep at all. The breakfast was very good. 
-2;My wife and I stayed here for the evening reception at a wedding, the room we had was one that had not been refurbished, it was tired and dingy, the carpets in the hall were covered in gaffer tape to hide the holes in them.  At the wedding reception the drinks were absolutely extortionate and were from a mobile bar that didn't even have draught mixers, so a very expensive whiskey and coke was served at full price with room temperature flat 2 litre bottled coke.
-2; My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights on the 6/09/15. First impressions of a lovely hotel in impressive settings continued to our room 205 which was very clean and comfortable and suited our needs very well. Dinner that night was lovely although the restaraunt was very cold despite several ceiling heaters in use. I asked if the door to the outside could be closed but this wasn't possible. The waiter did offer to bring me a blanket which was very kind but I hadn't dressed for dinner to wear a blanket.Returning to our room we heard no noise from the wedding that we had been warned about. After a lovely breakfast the next morning we left for the day returning late afternoon to find (I believe ) another wedding taking place. This one in the Cavendish Suite directly below our room. We had unsupervised children running and screaming along the corridor and knocking on the door and running away. My partner went to reception and was told that the parents would be found and the problem stopped. We had a lovely dinner again that night, this time served just off the bar which was much warmer. On returning to our room the party below was in full swing but we didn't mind as we knew the hotel policy was to stop the music at midnight. It did stop but the noise did not. It did not only continue downstairs but moved up onto our corridor with people having loud drunken conversations and arguments and children running and screaming the full length of said corridor, in and out of rooms and banging doors. Totally traumatised by 2.30am I went out and asked them if they would be quiet as people were trying to sleep.I got a drunken apology from one guy who said they were going back downstairs. They did for about 10 minutes before returning and continuing as before. At 3am I phoned reception and was told that they would come up and sort it out. I do not know if they came up. If they did it wasn't successful as the noise continued till just before 5 with a final bang of the doors!!!! After no sleep, going down to breakfast I asked at reception if there was a Manager available. There was and I asked to see him after I had eaten. I returned to reception and was asked to wait and they would send for him. The guy who arrived to speak to me was I believe the under manager, the Manager being unavailable. I explained what had been going on and he agreed that it was not acceptable. He said he would inform the Manager and that he would ring me.This call was arranged for after midday on Tuesday the 8th. It is now 1pm Thursday 10th and no phone call has been made.Not good.  This hotel is very geared up for weddings which I can appreciate brings in a very good revenue, but I think that they also need to cater to other guests too who sadly don't seem to count for much. It isn't rocket science to not put guests in a room directly above a party and to accomodate them on the same floor as said party goers.It is a beautiful hotel with an excellent restaraunt but they are not getting it right which is sad. So there ends the sorry tale. Anyone thinking of visiting this hotel, my only advice is, Don't go when there is a wedding on. I have rated the hotel poor but only because of the fact that they are not getting it right. 
-2; Food very disappointing, not hot, mean vegetable portions. A btl of delicato rose £33, totally outrageous especially as it's around £8 to buy. Bar tiny, very slow service. Hall not as grand as some in the local area. Hallway scruffy, floor needs replacing. No return for us. 
-2;Had a poor quality, low quantity afternoon tea for two that left me very disappointed. Would not recommend - Certainly no threat to the famous Tea Rooms up the Hill from the Hotel.
-2;" If you are planning a special stay,save your money! £140.00 for a dark, tired room overlooking a roof is far too expensive.The hotel is in need of a makeover,and it shows. You also get charged £3.50 to park your car which doesn't add to the experience of staying in a &quot;Grand&quot; hotel one little bit!   The breakfast was nice though "
-2; We visited today to have afternoon tea as a treat and found a seat in the Compass Bar. The place itself is very dated and could do with a good deep clean. We were seen to promptly by a lovely waitress who took our order which was afternoon tea for two. The coffee arrived quickly and was nice and hot. The afternoon tea arrived around 10 minutes later and to say we were disappointed is an understatement. For £15 per person we expected a lot more. On offer were two fingers of ham sandwiches on cheap white bread, two smoked salmon on cheap wholemeal bread, two egg mayonnaise on wholemeal and two cheese again on wholemeal. The cheese sandwiches were the most disappointing as once opened we had maybe ten strands of grated cheese inside! We sent this back and the waitress brought out a new plate with a couple of new sandwiches on but the same cheeseless cheese sandwich! There were four scones with a small tub of strawberry jam and a small tub of clotted cream. Although the scones were edible they were very dry, even with the jam and cream. The cake plate again was disappointing, two miniature macaroons which were not very tasty, two fingers of fruit cake which was heavy and stodgy and one small round lemon cheesecake (not much bigger than a £2 coin) which had been cut in half!  For an afternoon tea that cost us £30 served in what is supposed to be a 4* hotel we expected so much more. Fresh bread with a more varied variety of fillings would be a great start and you don't need four scones for two people! We've been to other places that charge the same and the quality and quantity for that matter is much better. I would definitely not recommended this place for afternoon tea and we shall not be visiting again. 
-2; I visited this hotel for a business conference. The reception staff could barely be bothered to cease their conversation to talk to me and give unclear directions when asked where our meeting was. The chef's offering of a vegetarian option for lunch was called Caesar salad without chicken. When I points out that this was merely lettuce with grated cheese and croutons they looked nonplussed. I insisted on having an omelette made instead. It took half an hour to get someone to explain how to exit the car oar, which it turned out takes pound coins only and no one thought to make customers aware if it.a very unsatisfactory experience with shoddy customer service. I am only glad I chose not to stay overnight. My colleagues informed me that they only got a few hours sleep due to very stuffy rooms. 
-2; I have never written a review before but I have just got back from a really stressful weekend at Henlow. This was a Birthday treat paid for by my family, we arrived at 2pm on Saturday as directed but staff seemed immediately overwhelmed and there was a que out the door. My stepmum fell over bags left in the lobby and we qued as the receptionist called for back up which was a long time coming. We were left in a tatty room to register with no drinks on the table and no-one explained anything, more people arrived (why should the numbers be a surprise?). A young man took the cards from us and when we asked a question he said the information was in the pack, we questioned why our treatments were not at the times we booked but he said we'd have to sort that out at the Spa.   The rooms were good to be fair, I could be picky about the missing piece of shower or the bad grouting but it didn't really effect us, but I could not believe the amount of people that were expected to share the small number of loungers by the pool, we shared 1 between 3 of us, or the fact there was a noisy Aqua class in progress, shortly followed by netball. The whirlpool was freezing, everyone was commenting on it, someone complained and was told it's not a jacuzzi and it was the right temperature. Finally after lots of complaints someone came and took the temperature and that of the pool. Today it was much warmer so I guess us guests and our goosebumps were right after all? We went up to the coffee bar to try and relax and guess what? They had closed (it was 5.30pm), no sign saying this we had to stand there for ages before another guest told us.  Dinner was good but the amount of supplements you have to pay is obscene given the cost of the weekend. Want steak, desert , slippers, use of thalassotherapy pool? All extra. Leave your robe anywhere- £25. It is sheer greed to cram that many people into the sparse facilities and then try to fleece them for £3 , £5 here and there.  I shared a twin room with my mum, the duvet was too hot for me and in the absence of an alternative I spent the night under the runner that was meant for the bottom of the bed. Most hotels provide a blanket. After a few hours sleep I just wanted to go home and had a good cry!!   Did I mention our small bottle of shower gel was half full?! Or the safe that was already locked so so we had to get a member of staff. Which brings me to the lockers you are supposed to use when you've left your room, trust me Mr Manager no matter how many times your staff say it's unusal for them not to work - they don't! If you spent 10 minutes watching people struggle finding one that works and then working out how to lock it then finding a member of staff to unlock it. This lunchtime I was one of 3 women waiting for the girl who had to cover both the boutique and the spa reception to unlock our lockers that had previously worked. It is very stressful and irritating and the least relaxing situation to be in when you're supposed to be de stressing.   I left early and would never go back. BUT all the staff we encountered were very nice and the food was very good. I'm glad I stayed for my massage because that was lovely. I just hope this review helps change things for future guests or means you manage your expectations and don't end up crying on your mums shoulder! 
-2; We stayed for a weekend as we where going to a wedding. The shower was terrible didn't feel clean after getting in, no bath either. The breakfast was poor. The hotel staff on the plus side where very friendly. Cost £15 to get into Luton and it looked like the taxi driver fiddle with the machine. as just before we stopped it was a pound cheaper and then it suddenly jumped in price. 
-2;My daughter had an important exam at Man Utd stadium so we booked premier inn night before. On arrival realised a game was to be played that night. Got roughly greeted on car park saying Are you booked in to which we answered yes so we're left alone. Once inside asked for table in restaurant to be told not till kick off time arrived. So went to room. Worse premium inn we have ever stayed in. Tiny room, dingy, lights not working, broken lamp shades, damp wardrobe, telly so small difficult to watch etc. premier inn promise good night sleep but we're not asked about this as we left this morning. Horrendous noisy from start to finish except when match was on 20.00 to 22.00. Supporters came back noisily tellies on full blast until early hours of the morning. Considering my daughter had a very important exam to sit today and I had work to go to it was a nightmare and an expensive nightmare at that, the dearest we have ever paid for a premier inn. Would definitely never return to this premier inn until refurbished at the least and prices made accordingly. The only saving grace of this inn was the waiters in the restaurant, especially nadine who was an absolute delight and very professional and friendly and couldn't do enough for us considering the restaurant had run out of certain food items,,
-2; The pictures of the hotel rooms on its website are not even close to what the rooms really look like. The bed is extremely uncomfortable is so soft that you actually sink into it. Wake up with horrible next pain. The bed only had 2 small very soft pillows and there were not additional pillows in the room I could use.  The location is great few min walk from the station and city centre.  Overly for the price you pay the place does not deliver. Next time we will try holiday inn that is next door but so much cheaper. 
-2; This was a last minute deal so we probably didn't get the best room it was a little grubby bathroom in particular.no air conditioning in the room but two air conditioning units right out side our window which started up at 5am and 8 am so no chance of a lie in .Staff were friendly but reception was a bit hap hazard. 
-2; Just stopped at the New Blossom Hotel, all I can say is I have stopped at better B & Bs, room was very nice, but that is where it stops, breakfast was just a handed baked up plate of bacon which was full of fat, baked up beans, about 10 !!, the dinning room was one of the most depressing thing I have ever seen, and the Bar what a joke, can't even call it a Bar, just 3 tables, dark and dull, £3.50 for a small bottle of coke. We had 1 evening meal which we pre- booked special rate of £30 instead of £50, well it was not even worth £10, good job I had not paid full rate as it was just a small steak and a few chips, all in all it was a waste of money, def not a 4 star Hotel, rubbish 
-2;I tried to arrange for a welcome bouquet of flowers to be placed in a room upon the arrival of family members who were visiting the UK. and staying at this establishment. Unlike central London hotels, Richmond were unable and/or unwilling to organise this for me. I have left bottles of wine/champagne, boxes of chocolates and flowers at hotels and cruise ships across the world merely by passing on my credit card details. It is inconceivable to me that Richmond would be unable to do likewise. I sincerely hope that my family members receive better service during their stay at this establishment
-2;We chose this hotel for our wedding night for the 4 poster beds and whirlpool baths. We were very excited about it. However when we arrived we found we couldn't get to the bar because there was a wedding party there so were forced to find another local pub to get a drink. On our return the wedding party had retreated to the private function room which was directly below our room - the Jane Seymore Room. The music was so loud it was like it was in our room and went on until 11:30 pm. At no point were we told this was a possibility. Very disappointing and a big waste of quite a considerable amount of money - I would have rather stayed at home where at least I could have a drink in peace and go to bed at a time of my choosing.
-2; Wedding guests got all the preference. We had to put up with noise and inconvenience. Was not impressed by a male staff when I phoned to complain who just said oh there's a wedding on so implied there was nothing to be done 
-2; I, the bride, booked a 2 night stay here for our mini moon. We were advised that it was one of the best and nicest hotels in the area. We have been fortunate enough to experience quite a few hotels in the country due to working in events so we have a lot of experiences to compare this to.  When I originally booked this I asked for the master suite, the hotel called me to advise that we would be better in a junior suite as it had a better view of the lake from all areas of the room. That was not entirely true as you could only really see the lake when you were stood at the window, along with patio furniture that was thrown everywhere, old wooden pallets on the grass-not the immaculate areas you would expect at a hotel of this calibre.  On arrival the welcome was warm and there was a card in the room, however in the hotel we had stayed the night before we were welcomed with a complimentary bottle of champagne.  The suite was spacious but basic. The bed was huge and very comfortable. However, the suite was next door to the laundry store and housekeeping staff were not quiet at all, banging around from 8am through to 9pm both days. Also, on walking through the hotel, there were always piles of sheets, clean and dirty, hovers, cleaning trolleys left in corridors with not a single member of staff in sight. Again, not what we would expect from a hotel of this calibre.  We ate in the restaurant both nights. The menu is limited, the service is appalling and the quality of food was average. After highlighting one issue, the waiting staff then avoided coming to our table and never once asked again if everything was ok.  We had a brief experience in the spa as it was supposedly fully booked even though during our time in their, there were at least 2 members of staff constantly stood around doing very little. It was pleasant. The treatment we did have was advertised as the most popular but we definitely wouldn't have it again.  Finally on check out, the receptionist asked if we'd enjoyed our stay when we said it could have been better and began to tell her about the noisy housekeeping staff, she responded with an apology but clearly did not want to hear any further issues.  In summary, we know of loads of hotels that would have appreciated the £1000 we spent here a lot more and would have looked after us a lot better.  We would NEVER recommend this hotel unless it was on budget deal as it is very over priced and we would NEVER stay here again!  Very sad as our wedding day was the best day of our lives and the hotel we had it at were amazing, but we are looking forward to our full honeymoon later this year to make up for the poor mini moon! 
-2; The hotel itself was nice, full of nice old wooden furniture and quite clean although we did unfortunately find a hair in a coffee mug. The staff were pleasant too. I liked that we had take away mugs for our hot drinks but there was only 4 milks and 1 packet of biscuits. There was 2 of us and I think this should have been doubled up to cater for us both. Unfortunately the whole experience was ruined by an awful night sleep. The pillows were flat and we are aching all over - especially our necks.  We were rudely awakened by the TV coming on by itself at 6:30 am WHAT TYPE OF HOTEL DOES THIS KIND OF TORTURE?! It's a Sunday morning, why? WHY?! Then we couldn't sleep properly after that due to slamming doors and drawers. So we were forced to attempt to sleep in until last minute and didn't get to have a morning going round Liverpool as planned.  So overall after a great first impression we were left quite dissatisfied unfortunately. 
-2; You couldn't wish for a lovelier facade, as you approach the Lygon Arms with your car full of cases and hopes, you think you have found heaven at last. Sadly there is too much facade and too little content. The food is shockingly bad, it follows some outdated ideas of presentation with meaningless and tasteless bits of plate decoration. We were offered huge pallid bread rolls, which could have been bought from local supermarket. We also had to wait over fifteen minutes to be seated despite having booked, and were offered no menus or drinks whilst we waited. The managers were harassed and the staff could barely speak English, which may go some way to explain the poor service and bad attitudes.  The rooms were okay, but like the estate agents details everything looks better and bigger than it really is. If you want relative comfort in beautiful Broadway then it's still okay, but eat out, there are some lovely small restaurants in Broadway.   It was disappointing but the setting is lovely. 
-2;" I booked this 2 weeks before our arrival via laterooms.com unexpectedly as I wasn't planning on booking anything or even going to York. I came across the Hilton with its reasonable price - for a Hilton hotel.   Parking was great, we paid £18 for 24 hours as we were only staying one night. Our car was parked for us and whenever we wanted it or wanted to get something out of the car, the staff were so helpful and brought the car up.  The room was right at the other end of the hotel last room on the top floor.For a &quot;Hilton&quot; I expected something slightly different - maybe personal touches ect. It was absolutely freezing, we only had a small radiator which was turned up as much as we could. The window had an awful draft we might as well have had it open. Very much an average room.   I was quite disappointed as the week before we kept getting emails from the Hilton regarding our stay ect and I was really looking forward to going.   When checking out the cleaners were in some of the rooms on our floor, as you do when the doors were open we had a little look in. Our room was totally different!! It felt because we had book via laterooms or because we are younger (20 & 21) we got put in the far end room away from everyone and just give the worst room of them all.  I didn't sleep much there was content banging from the hallway ect. We didn't mention any of this to the staff on reception as each time we went for something it felt as we were taking up there time ect.   This experience ruined our trip to York and I will not be returning anytime soon. "
-2; We stayed here for two nights. A lovely looking hotel inside and out but the rooms and corridors desperately need updating. There was no working air con in our room and it was like a sauna. In fact the dial fell off in our hand. The flooring is very creaky and the walls thin, meaning when people walk down the corridor, the whole room shakes. Very annoying at 2am as this is a wedding venue hotel. The breakfast was nice and the staff friendly but please do something about the rooms, oh and change the coffee! It was so strong you could strip wallpaper! 
-2; On arrival myself and 3 friends were put into rooms on a 'new' wing of the hotel. The rooms were dirty, shabby and not to the standard of those in the main hotel. Staff moved us after complaining to much more acceptable accommodation.  The meal in the restaurant was quite nice but the service was poor. When I asked for tartar sauce I was givena sachet like those in a pub or Mcdonalds, not what I would have expected of a 4 star hotel! The gym was pleasant but the pool and wet room needs attention as do the changing rooms and showers! 
-2; As you can see from my profile we travel a lot to different cities/types of hotels/holidays and I give honest reviews. It is difficult for me to write badly about places but I would avoid this place at all costs. We booked this hotel as we are foodies and we were travelling up to the cotswolds and thought this looked ideal. I noticed mixed reviews but thought we'd give it a go, big mistake. We walked through to check in were there is slightly inappropriate art on the walls for such an open area. We were early so weren't expecting our rooms to be ready we just wanted to leave our luggage as we were going into bath and didn't want the luggage in the car. As we were waiting people were checking out and complaining. I asked to leave our luggage and it was left just in the hall for all to see, not very secure. On our return I had to ask for help with the luggage and we were shown to a building separate from the main building. This building is calling out for attention. It could be nice but it looks like someone has forgotten to finish the outside area, as there are doors leading to the outside area from the ground floor rooms it would be nice to use these to their advantage. The rooms are filthy. My husbands insulin pen rolled off the bedside table under the bed, I wish I hadn't had to move the furniture to retrieve it. The light shades are the ones that are closed in, only use these if you are going to clean them, they were disgusting. The bathroom shower had an empty shampoo bottle placed on the door ledge, not even the shampoo that they supply, god knows how long it had been there. We booked dinner with big expectations because on the name associated with this hotel. We sat in the bar for a drink before hand which was pleasant our son loved the pool tables! We went to check in for dinner to be told go to the bar I will collect you from there, I explained we had just come from there but she was insistent that our table wasn't ready. The menu was not very imaginative and if you were staying for more that one night it would be boring. My jacket had to go over my chair as no one offered to take it, I didn't notice until I was packing my jacket away that the cuff on one side was filthy from where it had been touching the floor! Food was ok, limited wine list and the one we wanted they didn't have. Breakfast was ok. We were pleased to check out. 
-2; Spent five days at this hotel one of four coach tours. Luggage took 90 mins to reach our room from the foyer. So we sat down in our travel clothes for evening meal. Allocated 6.30 p.m the first evening. Another coach group was also present. Dining room (not one photographed on the internet) had square tables - seven to a table - we were too close together - pulled your chair back you knocked the person behind. Like a school dining room with loud noise. Service very slow. Even moving the time forward to 6.00 p.m. next evening the staff could not cope. Swimming pool - water cold - three ladies showers - steps up them - too small to turn around. Very disappointing considering this is meant to be a 4 star hotel. Would certainly not recommend this hotel in view of all the steep steps everywhere. 
-2; Stayed here over new year, lift not working, on top floor up very narrow stairs, room tiny, price quoted did not include vat, cost 179 on 31st and 99 on 1st PLUS vat 54 more!! No breakfast that costs 23 each extra! What a rip off! Don't go there 
-2;" Lovely decor & hotel, rooms fab, great location. BUT what a shame it was the most miserable hotel I've had the displeasure of staying in largely due to unfriendly staff in places & fellow residents/users. Most areas out of bounds for &quot;private functions&quot; when a hotel costs more than £200 per room midweek you expect access to all areas or at least 90% of the areas. Also far too hot & air con doesn't work, Needs to have a rethink on certain staff & strategies. Sadly no atmosphere / spirit would not recommend or return. "
-2; I stayed at this hotel for one night on the 30th November. Check in was efficient but as one of the two lifts was broken I had to wait almost 10 minutes to use the working lift as a bus-load of guests had arrived shortly before I did. Arriving reasonably late I decided on room service, ordering Chicken Parmigiana and a bottle of mineral water. The mineral water was not chilled and without ice or lemon in the glass. The meal on the other hand was only lukewarm with over cooked linguine and not even a single gram me of Parmesan in the dish. I should have sent it back but needed food and sleep... My room was not clean and had a waste basket full of rubbish in it (which I moved to the corridor outside the room) I was unable to connect to WiFi (not free I assume). Free WiFi is a must to me and is offered even in the cheapest of chains. The bathroom colour scheme was very seventies and the shower head looked like it might not have been cleaned for some time. The white plastic shower control was grimy..unfortunately not clear in the photo I took! Breakfast the following morning was OK, no more, no less. The hotel leaves a feed-back form in the room which I completed ...I assume that went straight in the bin! 
-2;Went to a birthday function at Bunkers (the golf clubhouse) recently. The bar staff were lovely - very friendly and efficient. The food was also very nice - plentiful, tasty and well-presented. The main part of the buffet was cleared once everyone had finished and the puddings (which were equally as delicious) were brought out - so everything was done in a timely manner.  One massive complaint though was the noxious smell in the ladies' toilet. The drains were playing up and, when I complained to a regular golfer, I was told that this was a frequent occurrence. This suggests to me that the management at Dunston are not dealing with the problem. The regulars knew not to use the ladies' toilet, but to use the disabled toilet because this was located away from the main toilet block.  I have written a letter of complaint to the management at Dunston, but I am assuming that the situation won't be dealt with as the golfers have complained on numerous occasions to no avail.  If you are female and have cause to go to Bunkers, you would be well advised to take a gas mask. Either that, or cross your legs for the duration of your visit.
-2; Based on good tripadvisor reviews,my sister and I met with our parents for Sunday lunch. We were impressed by the initial decor and ambience of the hotel reception and bar area and looked forward to our lunch,despite there being a £4.00 supplement for roast beef or duck. 2 courses cost £18 or £22 for 3 courses. Service was slow but pleasant but the waitresses aprons were dirty as were the toilets. Our starters were very nice but lukewarm. Main courses were lamb and pork and again lukewarm with tough meat and roast potatoes that were unpleasant and difficult to cut. I didn't want to make a fuss as this was a family get together but I did mention to the waitress that the food wasn't hot....her response was that she would pass the comment on. I expected a reduction in the bill but this wasn't forthcoming. This is not a cheap,Sunday lunch out and we were all disappointed..how difficult is it to serve hot food and decent meat and roast potatoes ...?? Also,cleanliness in public areas and in staff appearance is crucial to repeat business. I don't normally complain but this was worth mentioning as it would be so easy to get it right.. 
-2; Having booked in to this hotel for 2 night D.B.B and looking forward to 2 relaxing evening meals and a quite after dinner drink we were somewhat dissapointed. Whilst the food we had was ok it was not what one expects of a 4 star rated hotel, with saturdays main choice from Lamb, Salmon, Fish and chips plus a vegetarian pasta dish and sundays was worse still the choice of gammon,egg and chips, salmon, fish and chips and the same veg dish. Starters and sweets were no better for choice and certainly non of the dishes were worthy of been prepared by a chef more like a cook Who ever they had no flare or passion for food. We understand that hotels have to have functions and events etc but in this case it is at the cost of other residents. On the plus side the staff were very friendly and helpfull, the room and all linen were excellent but the structure is is need of TLC and in need of the rating to be reassed asap. 
-2; I had stayed here in October 2010 for one night and had no qualms about returning 3rd February 2012. The location is perfect but my stay was not. I was allocated room 301 which was a nightmare - no bedside table which also meant no bedside phone or lamp. No heat in the bathroom and bedroom heat only improved by addition of a dimplex which had to be moved to open doors and drawers. Moved to room 308 which was marginally better because bed was in different position.Still very cold room, gale from window right beside bed,no heat in bathroom and only a trickle of hot water. Nowhere safe to plug in kettle - had to unplug dimplex and have kettle on floor. Staff pleasant and helpful but no manager available. Neither of these rooms were safe and certainly not worth £101pn(room only). A most disappointing and upsetting experience. 
-2;Bathroom smelt of drains, Hairs in sink and dirty floor. Patio doors could be easily opened and when travelling alone I did not feel safe. Serve in the bar was poor and our waiter was rude, his name was Chris. He was more interested in the other employees than us. Left us just wanting to leave the bar. I ordered Fish and chips I got batter and chips. I would like to have thought this was a one off but been there twice in past two months as it is the hotel our company use and on both occasions the food and bar were poor.
-2;Having booked 3 months ago to attend a function we were surprised and a little confused to be told there was no booking and that the hotel was full. We were asked to take a seat whilst management investigated what had gone wrong. We were then told that there had been a booking but that it had been cancelled. When we asked who cancelled the booking staff went to investigate further. After another wait we were told that we did have a booking after all and that surname and first names had been transposed. By this time we were just grateful that the mix up had been sorted as we needed to get ready for the evening function. We were given a room on the second floor. On opening the door to the room we were met with a strong smell of stale cigarettes. The room overlooked the station which is in the process of bring remodelled so resembled a building site. Never mind we weren't in Birmingham for the views. The bathroom was pleasantly large however only one side of the mirror mounted lights was working which made the application of make up rather interesting. Beware if using the sink or the tub the water takes ages to drain. By the time I'd showered I was up to my ankles in water.  The evening function we were attending was lovely and the hotel staff pleasant enough. For a one night stay in Birmingham and for the convenience of staying in the hotel where the function was being held cost us £115. I don't think I would stay here again the Premier Inn along the road would give a better room for far less.
-2; We stayed here just before xmas and chose it mainly for location. The location is the best thing about it and the only reason I would stay again. This is also the reason for the high price compared to other Travel Lodges The room was tiny and not particularly comfortable with horrible lighting, but this was expected with a budget hotel. The room was clean and quiet though. On arrival there was a large queue at check in and member of staff guided us to the self check in machines. This failed to print our room card, meaning we then had to rejoin the back of the queue. We booked breakfast for each morning online and got the online discount. I cannot warn you enough not do this!!! There is only one word to describe the breakfast we had on the first morning, VILE!!! Definitely not worth the money! There was bacon & sausages that tasted funny, obviously very poor quality, huge pieces of undercooked tomato, instant scrambled egg that had been left under a heat lamp and formed a crust and ditto with the baked beans. I thought at least I could get a real cup of tea, but there wasn't even fresh milk supplied. The only edible thing was the toast!! We decided that we wouldn't use the breakfast coupon for the second morning and went to reception to ask for a refund for it. We were told no! After kicking up a fuss and pointing out what a complete rip off it was, the manager finally came out and gave us a refund straight away without any problem. Not sure why this couldn't of been done in the first place? In summary, great location and OK as a place to crash for the night. Don't expect much else and DO NOT have the breakfast. Go to one of the many places just seconds walk outside the front door, it will be cheaper and much tastier!! 
-2; The hotel and location itself was lovely however the room we had (I think 164) was terrible. Very low slanted ceilings. I slept the side where it was worst and upon waking in the night I sat up and banged my head with a huge thud on the ceiling. I'm only 5ft 5 so it's at a dangerous level and not very practical at all. Considering we paid over £100 for a small, cramped room where we had to keep squating to move around it was not good value at all. 
-2;We have stayed at the Hilton Islington on previous occasions. To hear the rooms had been refurbished was good as the price we paid should have reflected this. We stayed on the 4th Floor. I was amazed to find that other than a chest height mirror in the bathroom, with no natural light, there were no other mirrors in the room at all! I would have expected there to have been a full length mirror in the room to enable one to ensure one looked presentable before heading for a days business? I went to the downstairs WC hoping to find a full length mirror to check out my appearance, but again no full length mirror. On my first nights stay I did ask the receptionist about the mirror, however she seemed disinterested in my query. Also 2 people staying in a room with just one mirror in the bathroom is totally inconvenient when you both need to get ready at the same time! Washing my hair was not an option either, as how do you dry your hair without a mirror to view? I doubt that the rooms were designed with women staying in mind.
-2; Only stayed for 1 night, however this was spoilt by one member of the restaurant staff. In the morning we went for breakfast - self service. My husband started to pour some tea, this was placed next to the buffet, then in a very loud voice she said he was not to do this, apparently restaurant staff do this. We were informed by one of the guests that on entry to the restaurant the staff tell us, however when we entered the restaurant there were no staff to greet us. We did not like the manner in which we were spoken to especially in front of other guests. She was hostile. On checking out, the receptionist asked us if we enjoyed our stay, we told her of the incident in the restaurant and she said she would speak to the staff to find out what went wrong, we do not know if she did or not. She appeared unfriendly. Also found it strange that tea/coffee maker is hidden in the wardrobe. This hotel did not seem to have any sort of atmosphere, in the bar or the restaurant. The management should bring in new staff. On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable. Would NOT stay here again. 
-2; SPA - Pamper day conjures up the idea that you will have a lovely relaxing environment and enjoyable treatments then DO NOT go to this hotel. It is NOT relaxing. We arrived on a Sunday where we found the 
-2; 18 of us went to the Michael Buble tribute night last night for our staff christmas night out the entertainment was very good, but the food was the worst food I have every had on a staff night out and we have been to most places around Southport. The starters arrived late and most us had ordered chicken liver pate which was warm!!! a serious health risk. The main course was late and again most of us had ordered the turkey with all the trimming or so we thought, what arrived was a slab of meat, two carrots sticks, a mound of packet mash, 1 sausage and a square of stuffing, no vegetables or roast potatoes???? and then when it came to desert there was only two choices and 13 of us had chosen chocolate roulade only to be told 5 of us would have to go without as they had run out??? We expected better from a 5 star hotel that most of us have eaten in before and new that we would be getting fantastic service and food, what a disappointment and would not recommend this to anyone!!!!!! 
-2; I called with my daughter for lunch. I hadn't been for a few years and when I last went it wasn't that good but the car park always seems full so we thought we would give it another try. My daughter ordered a chicken dish and the the chips were cold. I ordered a prawn open sandwich. Big mistake. I misread it and thought that it came with chips - it didn't - it came with a very unattractive salad - of sorts! Im sorry but if you are paying £7-£8 for a sandwich I would at least like an attractive salad and a small portion of chips. So just looking at it wasn't that appetising and when I tasted the prawns neither were they - watery and tasteless. Sorry but it wasn't value for money and I wont be returning. However the guy that asked why I had left my meal was actually very nice and he did ask whether I wanted an ice cream or desert in replacement. It wasn't his fault but come on guys - you can do a really nice salad on the side for not a lot of money and the bread needs to be fresher!!!! 
-2;"Having taken a day off work to spend a relaxing day in the Oulton Hall Spa I wished I'd not bothered!! The pool & jacuzzi were experiencing temperature issues - the jacuzzi should run at around 37 degrees according to the notice on the wall - it was allegedly 27 degrees but I would question that. The pool, it is once again alleged was 29 degrees - both felt uncomfortably cold. The sauna, despite its faulty door, was at an unbearable temperature and the steam room was tepid and lacking in steam. Other guests were equally as disappointed and club members openly told me that these issues had been ongoing for a long time. At no point did anyone make us aware of the issues, there was a sign on the reception desk however as we were directed straight into the bar area this was not seen and never mentioned.   As treatments were booked for 4:30pm it was a long and rather non relaxing experience as we sat by the pool watching the clock. I made the reception staff aware of my disappointment and was given a rather disingenuous apology and an offer to use the facilities again another day. I live 45 miles away so &quot;dropping by&quot; isn't an option.   The treatments were enjoyable, the therapists were pleasant and professional as always.   That evening I emailed the Spa to raise my concerns, they responded by telephone 36 hours later leaving a message on my mobile. I returned the call, leaving a message on the Spa answerphone - at the time of writing this review I await a response.   In summary, Oulton Hall Spa facilities have deteriorated rapidly (I have visited on 4 other occasions of late) and it would appear that the management aren't overly concerned by this. My suggestion - spend your money elsewhere as that's £98 and a day off work that I won't be getting back!! "
-2; We knew it was being renovated and it certainly needs it. Very tired room, cracked wash basin. Although clean and tidy and comfortable bed. Had a meal in the 701 Restaurant, for the starter my husband had a glorified Prawn Cocktail, not very inspiring and I had a Thai Chicken Started which turned out to be a chicken sausage on a stick with a Thai sauce and spicy salad. My husband then had a rump steak which he could not eat as it was full of gristle, he didn’t get charged for this thank goodness but would have preferred a decent steak. My Lamb Shank was ok, although not impressed with the powdered mashed potato! During our second night, I washed my hair and was drying it with the hair dryer and most of the electricity went off, just a few sockets remain on but no lighting! I was too tired to complain and it was late, it came back on again at 8am. I could say a lot more but nothing positive! 
-2;"The Maids is old, so you must expect atmosphere, some quirkiness and a sense of history. This was all good. The rest was not..... Being a single traveller of a certain age, I booked a single room. When I checked in I found it was on the second floor. I asked if there was a lift - there was, and was given directions to find it. What I wasn't told is that when you get to the second floor, there are still stairs to be negotiated, and the route to the room wasn't at all clear so it took me a while to find it. If this had been explained I would have accepted the offer of help with my luggage. The room itself was cramped, small and expensive as it didn't include breakfast. The ensuite bathroom was the same size as the bedroom and you had to go down two separate steps to reach the toilet. There was also a thick layer of dust on the bathroom blind. While there was a sign on the bedroom side of the bathroom door saying &quot;Mind the Step&quot;, when you get up in the middle of the night to &quot;use the facilities&quot; and are in a strange place, you tend to forget about steps, so I had a nasty fall resulting in severe bruising to my hip. If I had brittle bones, the result would have been much worse. This was reported to the management when I checked out and they agreed to take action to try to avoid future accidents. The hotel has wifi, but there are no instructions in the room on connecting. You need a code which is input once you have opened your browser - some instructions in the information pack in the room would be a good idea. I had dinner in the restaurant in the evening and found the food mediocre at gourmet prices. The wine, however, was acceptable on quality and price and was comparable to other establishments."
-2; Stayed last month for 1 night before a wedding. Asked for a quiet room and was given a worn out but cleanish room ( mould around bath) in the annexe part of the hotel. Was kept up until 2am by a very noisy next door -room walls paper thin. I mentioned this fact on checkout and suggested that in future if a quiet room was requested they avoided putting them in this area! Had booked DBB and was told on arrival that the only booking left for a slightly later sitting was 8.30pm so we chose that. Service was incredibly slow ( received starter at 9pm) , though the food tasted good when it finally arrived, portions were small....so overall I would be highly unlikely to book here again and certainly never accept a room in their annexe. Having said all that the breakfast was great and service in the restaurant was good too. The grounds that the hotel are set in are also good. 
-2;My husband booked this as a surprise birthday treat. it was a surprise but for all the wrong reasons. He expected a hotel of some standard given its 4 star rating and what we got was anything but. He did book a standard double - same as we have been booking for years and this was honestly the 1st time we have ever had such issues. The room in my mind was a single room with a double bed squeezed in. There was only a single wardrop and no drawers. Most of our clothes stayed in the case. The bathroom was so tiny that you could not even fully open the door and had to shuffle in sideways. To put the shower on you had to reach over the toilet. not easy to do for a small lady. whilst using the facilities I had a choice of scrapping my leg on the bath of touching the cold wall - honestly it was that small. The heating in the rooms is on a timmer - also something I had never came across before. I complained twice that my room was cold. heating only comes on at 5pm so dont expect to get cosy at this hotel in winter. We stayed for two nights and I honestly wanted to go home after one. The second night I awoke from sleep freezing. there was a very cold draught coming from the windows and no way to heat up the room. I ended up putting on socks and a jumper to keep warm. When i complained in the morning i was told i should have phoned down but what were they going to do at 2am. I had a romantic notion of waking up on my birthday, full of the joys but instead I was up at 6am , looking like a bag lady who slept rough. the hotel looks nice from the outside and is very pleasant inside. breakfast was also of a very good qulaity and was piping hot. If you do stay at this hotel avoid room 304. Pay extra and go for the upgrade or better still, stay somewhere else and just come here for breakfast.
-2;" We decided, after much deliberation to go to the Heywood house for our 'Honeymoon.' Ok, it's not our proper honeymoon, but I was due in for surgery on Tuesday in a hospital in Liverpool, we'd got married on Saturday and I knew I would be on bedrest after the surgery, so we left for our hotel on Monday and had a night there before surgery and a night after surgery. I chose a &quot;4 star&quot; hotel because it's our honeymoon and I wanted it to be special. I paid extra for a &quot;Plush&quot; room and told them it was my honeymoon.   Well I was sorely disappointed. By no stretch of the imagination is this hotel a 4 star, 3 star maybe, and for a 3 star I would be happy, but I wanted something special.  Firstly, we arrived and were sent to our room. My first thought was, small, dark, stuffy, and not that nice. In about 5 minutes I began to notice more and more problems, the peeling paintwork, the water stains on the bathroom walls, the strange duct tape on the bathroom door (?) so I lifted back the bedsheet and wished I hadn't. I found pubic hair and weird brown/red stains on the sheet. Even the carpet was stained. Enough was enough, My husband called down to reception and told them all the problems.   To be fair they did say they'd move us. But they ignored us for over an hour, while we sat and waited in their grubby little room. Eventually my husband went down to reception because he had to move the car, there is no car park, we parked outside and paid for an hour and he had to move it. The receptionist called up saying she was coming up to move us, she &quot;claimed&quot; the hotel was full...in total we saw about 4 people in the entire hotel the entire time we stayed there. Eventually she came and we moved down the corridor to room 211.   Room 211. Was it the lovely plush 4 star hotel that we wanted? No! But at least the sheets were clean, I know because I examined them. Apart from all the rips on the sheet and cover, it was at least clean. The paintwork left a lot to be desired though and the carpet looked old and worn. The window was tiny and wouldn't open, the room was stuffy and small and I wasn't happy with it at all. For the price it was &quot;ok&quot; but not that it claimed to be 4 star. I wanted something special! And 4 star &quot;sounds&quot; special. Don't be fooled.  And if that is a &quot;Plush&quot; room I dread to think what a normal room looked like. Most amusing was the teeny tiny chair. I sat down in in and found myself very squashed. Granted I am a curvier lady, BUT I'm not HUGE, that chair was ridiculous, my husband tried it and got stuck. He hobbled around the room with the chair attached to him! Who was that chair made for? Children? Supermodels? Child supermodels?  One good point, because I'm fair, is the shower. Loved it. It was very nice and powerful, easy to control and I could've stayed there forever exalting in the lovely power shower.   I can't comment on the food though, we didn't eat there. We ate down the room at the Olive Press, which was fantastic and after surgery when I couldn't go out, my husband asked them to prepare a takeaway hummus and some calamari for me and they did it. I was very impressed with them.   Overall though, the Heywood House was too claustrophobic in those little rooms, with tiny windows and I had to use the air con to keep cool, which I don't like. It is a good price, but it's not 4 star! And at the very least, it should be clean. And it certainly wasn't. I wanted something special, but this was less than average in my view. I still keep seeing the image of the horrible pubic hair and stain. Yuck. "
-2; We stayed at the Stuart hotel on our overnight trip to Derby, The staff were very friendly and the food was great, BUT......Our room was on the 3rd floor and outside our window was the air conditioning units which were very noisy and went off every 7 minutes (for 5 minutes at a time....like clockwork - ALL night!!) We were obviously at the 'hostel' end of the hotel as the rooms all around us were full of teenagers who were having parties in their room till 11pm and then started again at 4am! Maybe we just chose a bad time to stay there but definitely wouldn't stay there again. :o( 
-2; Awful is the main word that comes to mind. To be fair the park is clean and bearable but it is dated, old fashioned and not for families like us. Our child's bag was stolen, staff mostly unhelpful but I imagine happens a lot. Didn't feel safe and quite a lot of unsavoury characters walking around. If you risk it pay to go gold and buy your own food, food at buffet type canteens are vile!!! On a positive children love it and I suppose that's what counts after all 
-2; I attended a recent evening wedding reception where the bride and groom were busy looking after the guests needs. They both looked extremely harassed, I was informed there would be a photo booth which arrived unfortunatly there was no staff to set it up.........so the guests ended up having to do it! So beware potential bride and groom, you may not get from this hotel what you were promised. What suprises me is for a hotel that holds weddings regularly i would have thought everything should have run smoothly. 
-2; The room - good size, nice bed and bedding, comfortable bathroom. For extra 10 Pounds you get a sea view. We opened the french door the sea in all it's glory presented itself to our eager eyes. The sound was that of a river of relentless traffic passing leasurly by. In the small hours when all the drivers parked their cars and slipped into their pajamas a teenager's nightclub next door came to life that made us miss the sound of traffic. Dinner was booked for 21.00H. We presented ourselves at 21.00 and were told that the kitchen is closed. After some protest we were left standing in the middle of the room until the staff verified our claim. When the dinner arrived we were sorry that the kitchen stayed open for us. Horrible tasting food, good dessert though. Some silver lining there must be! 
-2; Hard to see how this hotel has a four star rating. Lacking in quality touches and in real need of refurbishment. Bedroom was comfortable and clean but needed updating, basic and dated decor and furniture. Good shower and nice towels though. Communal areas were shabby. Cooked breakfast was plentiful and nice. Dining area was too big, part of a function room. Staff were average, didn't even asked if we'd had a nice stay. Having walked round the town, there are nice B&Bs not widely advertised that would probably have been nicer and better value. 
-2; Not my first visit but it will be my last. We booked a garden room which was quite small but the bed was very comfortable and the views were lovely. No robe or slippers? Available on request they say, to me that is not acceptable in a hotel that claims to be as this one does. The bathroom was spotless all areas were clean but aged, the shower was ok quality toiletries. Breakfast was £15 for a full english. It was quality but again overpriced and toast? I'd just say order it half an hour before you want it. 3 of us ordered separately and all had the same problem in delay, it was NY day I understand but come on? The hotel car park is small and it's on a first come first served basis accessible by lift which is very convenient but £9.50 for parking which is simply tight considering it's their own car park The room cost £184 excluding breakfast! Understandably it was NY eve so we can see how the price goes up, however there was nothing special about it from the hotels perspective.  In Nottingham there are much better offerings much cheaper, with a better overall service and facilities. Harts seem to think they are as good as they were when they first opened but they aren't so it is about time they listened to the people who give constructive feedback, who have parted with an unreasonable amount of money for a mediocre facility. In a hotel of this supposed calibre we were expected to pay £2.45 for a bottle of still water (no complimentary water here) .  It was a good quality hotel, but it seems thry have lost sight of what matters and fly on restaurant reviews. We stay all over the country in various locations and hotels, I was really excited to bring my family here for our stay whilst we were in the City as I remembered fondly. Sadly we were all highly disappointed and as far as the great reviews go on here all I can say is that I left a great review when it was great. Don't settle for this hotel. There is much better luxury out there with more reasonable prices. 
-2;Where to start...the room was insanely small, the tv remote didn't work, the shower wouldn't drain, it was too hot, the breakfast was a massive rip off, the waiting staff were stroppy, room wasn't ready at check in etc etc.  Never again!
-2; We stayed here for my husbands birthday last night. We booked a club room which cost £127 for one night bed and breakfast. My overall opinion of this hotel is style over substance!! The sheet did not fit the bed so it came off in the night, the toilet was slanted- not fitted to the wall properly. My husband had to unblock the bath plug it was full of hair which was totally disgusting!! The tea and coffee was not topped up,we called down for some more, it took 3 try's to get anyone to answer the phone and when told it would be sent up straight away - it never arrived!! The pillows were a joke only good for the bin!! We complained to reception and all they could offer was a cocktail!! To be frank they did not give a toss!  Bitterly disappointed and let down this was a special occasion which we had looked forward to, we certainly will never book here again! My advice is go to one of the many other hotels in the city- this one thinks it's far too trendy to care about customer experience!! 
-2;The check in staff were great, but I have never stayed in such an awful bedroom. The bedroom was small and very, tired, with a tiny veranda and an old table and chairs. The bathroom appeared to have been fitted out in the 60s,but the worst part was the fact that any view from the bedroom was taken over by a huge building roof.  Although I was grateful for a complimentary room, I think that the objective of making me see the Haven in a more favourable light was lost.
-2; For a hotel that has been open less than 2 years, I was appalled at the sheer lack of attention to detail within the rooms. From poorly fitted wardrobes with edges so bad that dust collected from the Air Conditioning Extract Vent to a floor in the en-suite wet-room that did not drain away thereby in danger of flooding the bedroom. (I was in an accessible guest room.) Staff were also not bothered about my disability and no offer of assistance was ever offered by anyone anywhere! 
-2; Stayed last night for a meet up with friends. Room was clean, bed made with blankets. Our cupboard kept jamming, we didn't complain as this was for one night only. Bathroom clean, no toilet brush! Seating in the bar very uncomfortable, worn out sofas and a bit messy. Not a place I would go back to as breakfast was poor. We arrived early as it was busy and was served quickly, expected a buffet for £19. One sausage, scrambled eggs, beans 1/2 a tomato one slice of bacon,a slice of Stornaway blood pudding, not a nice quality and one mushroom! Menu choice of different combinations available. Toast and coffee ok, cereal yogurt fruit and cheese, a bit sweaty, and ham. Heated chocolate and plain croissants. Very poor compared to other breakfast tables, I do expect more for the price. Staff pleasant , but it got a bit more hectic after nine as people were having to wait for tables, and service slowed down.  Situated very central and nice view over the Avon river. 
-2; We stayed here in the first weekend of September for my husband's birthday, and there were a few things which just spoiled the experience a bit for us. As with all my reviews I do try to be balanced, but the fact is that when a place charges eye watering prices, a person has a right to expect a really first rate stay... we were left wishing we'd taken the cash, got a better room and service in Cotswolds House and pocketed the change.  I spoke to the hotel in advance and booked room 9, which turned out to be fairly basic and with an uninspiring view of the carpark. The room was otherwise nice enough except the cushions on the sofa really needed a wash. Sitting on dirty uphoulstry turns my stomach a bit, so we didn't really use the downstairs living room - shame as giving cushion covers a wash isn't a big ask. There was a first rate entertainment system, with TV, DVD, iPod player, WiFi all included. Problem being the TVs kept on needing to be re-set and were awfully temperamental so we ended up just giving up. We're a young couple and not technophobes so it wasn't us being thick.  Service was so-so: left standing around at breakfast and eventually just sitting ourselves down and helping ourselves to food, asked for information about the Polo (mentioned on the hotel website) which seemed an awful hassle... the information never did materialise. It was my husband's birthday - our first as a married couple hence the weekend away - so I had called the hotel to let them know in advance. Not one single member of staff said happy birthday, nothing was laid on... not even a lousy card or chocolate in the room. I brought a birthday cake in a box from London which wouldn't fit into the tiny fridge in our room so the staff took it to put it in the main fridge. Someone put something heavy on top of it and it was ruined, squashed flat. The front of house staff blamed the kitchen staff, but to be honest it would have been common sense to put it out of the way or to let the other staff know not to squash it. We got a free half bottle of cava by way of apology, but given I know from other tripadvisor reviews other customers got these as standard for special occasions like birthdays it was pretty lame.   The front of house staff in general were nice enough but with a total inability to multitask. I appreciate if team members are serving other customers having to wait, but it's just good manners when another guest is waiting to make eye contact and say 'I'll be with you in a moment'. Waiting in a small reception room with up to 3 members of staff and not one of them acknowledging my existence, even to say hi, several times over 3 days was just a really disconcerting experience. No one asked on checkout if we'd enjoyed our stay... otherwise I would have pointed out my issues.  The pool was not as nice as it looked on the website - was really tiny and the area around was just a bit grubby and unkempt. Don't go to this place for the spa as it just isn't worth it. There is a bit of a problem with things being kept clean and tidy in general, there was a group of girls who had a picnic at the back of the gardens on the saturday and on the sunday lunchtime the litter and glasses were still there. The food remains had been eaten and spread around by animals overnight which was a bit gross and made me worry about the hygeine in parts of the hotel we couldn't see.  On the positives - this is a really beautiful building done up in a classy style with stunning gardens. I guess I chose the wrong room - don't stay in room 9 - and the others are probably nicer. The breakfast was delicious, as was the roast we had on the sunday. The little pub down the road was brilliant and reasonably priced, all the food we had there was great. The service, albeit a bit laissez faire for my liking I guess was unintrusive if you prefer that. My main issue is that for this price there are dozens of other places you could stay like Babington House, Cotswold House or even Lime Wood which would have been very much better for the money. I just finished the weekend wishing we'd gone elsewhere where we weren't made to feel like our presence was a hassle for them. 
-2;" We booked a Valentines weekend break at this hotel and thought a more modern hotel would be a change from the usual older central london hotels. The rate quoted included breakfast which was indicated clearly on my confirmation email. When we arrived this was also freely confirmed by the friendly receptionist.  The room was on 11th floor with one small window overlooking the atrium, do not expect any natural light or fresh air. This would be fine except the air conditioning, despite being set to the coolest setting, did nothing to reduce the sweltering temperature of the room.  Despite both of us trying everything with the bath/shower taps there was no way of getting water through the bath tap (no matter what it persisted with overhead shower only). So no relaxing soak after a long day sightseeing.  Breakfast was a bit of a scrum but they completely ran out of bacon on Sunday morning with half an hour of breakfast service to go which is inexcusable for any hotel!  When we came to check out at 12:00pm there was quite a queue at reception. A member of staff was running round offering people express checkout but I wanted to check my bill first. Thankfully I did because our breakfast was being charged for despite it being included in my rate. This added around £65 to the bill which I asked to be removed. Then the problems really started. The receptionist had obviously had some difficulty with the customer in the queue ahead of me and when it came to my turn I understood why. This girl was clearly &quot;unwell&quot;. She appeared to be under the influence of either drink or drugs and just stared blankly at both me and her computer while trying to amend my bill. Eventually, after about 20 minutes of nothing happening despite me asking several times what the problem was (she just mumbled and continued to stare blankly) my partner sought out the reception manager who took over from the receptionist and sorted out my bill very quickly. It was obvious to me that this girl was uncapable of dealing with customers (she was incapable of communicating at all actually) and this should have been noticed much earlier - there were three other receptionists working hard behind the desk.  Apart from that the hotel has a great location and was clean and adequate. I wouldn't stay there again though. "
-2;After having had friends rave to me about Hoar Cross Hall & Spa for over a decade I was excited to visit fir a friend's 40th birthday, I couldn't, however, have been more disappointed. Having visiting lots of other spas all over the world myself, it couldn't have fell any more below par. And I wasn't the only person in our large group visiting for the first time who said the same either. We had booked suites so our rooms were very spacious and very nice, and we all enjoyed a very comfortable night's sleep. The spa area is very tired on the whole and the carpets in the public corridor between the pools really smells awful. One of the changing rooms was very unsatisfactory - the changing rooms in the golf and country club where I am member is far far better - and I wasn't expecting it to be at least the same. The first afternoon we had pre-booked afternoon tea but it was the worst afternoon tea I've ever had - and I've had lots of afternoon teas at stately homes etc before. The sandwiches had clearly spent a lot of time out on the side or in the fridge without being covered as they were very dry. The cake was also appalling and in one case stale - my friend whose birthday it was had to discreetly spit it out into her napkin. The cakes were also not very exciting or varied. When we complained the manager could not confirm who old the cakes were etc! We ended up getting a £10 refund on this element. The evening meal while OK was also not that exciting and the staff not that friendly. One young female waitress did not smile and pulled her face when we asked for fresh bread as what we were given was dry. She also gave my bday friend the wrong glass of wine - she gave her one she is unable to drink - and again she pulled a face. The buffet lunch was also not that great - queues for pudding and other parts of it were cold when it should have been hot and not that great, We managed to get a deal on our stay which was far less that full price but I have to say that even that was not worth it - I'd have been furious had I paid full. I think this is a venue that is trading on it's hey-day past which it's clearly fallen far below of. I think it needs to invest in a much needed makeover. I would not recommend a spa visit here.
-2; stayed for 3 nights very shabby room, a big disappointment, The TV was a joke, 1 packed of biscuits for a rm for 2. The white towel's were grey, the stingy breakfast was very over priced as was the whole stay, not far off 500.00 for 3 night's.I have stayed in many hotels up and down the country this was the biggest let down. The Grange is no 4 star. on the plus side lovely staff good location. 
-2; Booked a girls Weekend package which included dinner breakfast and a spa treatment and stay. Hotel: Reception staff were helpful and our rooms were ready early. Rooms were nice and clean and quiet too. They thoughtfully put our 3 rooms together which was nice.  Spa: The spa was average the reception staff were helpful. The changing rooms could do with a revamp and be bigger. The therapist I had was good and my treatments were ok. 6 of us had treatments 4 of us were satisfied with our therapists but 2 of my friends had the same lady who texted throughout doing massages and was clearly having a bad day and completely disinterested. My friend did complain after. The 1 hour treatments were more like 45 mins they clearly did stuff to shave off the time.  The restaurant: I don't know where to start. We arrived at 8pm we had to ask to order and for bread after being there 25mins. 6 times we asked for butter which took a long time to come. There was 4 options of each course one of the starters was unavailable and one of the deserts. After 55 minutes our starters arrived. All I can say is the goats cheese starter was so ridiculous the chef should be embarrassed to send it out. It was a garnish and nothing else. I have eaten at many Al a carte restaurants this was by far the worst starter I've seen. We then had to ask for our mains nearly 45 mins after this. Some of my main was missing and the steaks were cooked very rare when asking for them medium. The deserts were not up to scratch either. The lady who seemed to be in charge of the waiting staff was apauling. Sack her please! She was rude and offish with everyone. Her young staff seemed quite wary of her. No one apologised for the utterly terrible service we had and believe me we weren't the only ones having bad service. Never eat here unless they replace all the staff!  Had a great time away with my friends which makes up for these other things. 
-2;"Just left this hotel after staying the weekend for a wedding. Very disappointed. Certainly not worth the 4 star rating. Looked very tired! Not offered any tea or coffee at breakfast, no mushrooms,spoke to the Chef to be told &quot;sorry we've had a busy morning&quot;. Watch the prices charged for drinks at happy hour.....try to still charge full price. All in all a very poor experience....overpriced and over rated."
-2; We visited this bed and breakfast over the first weekend of November as part of a wider family group who were attending a wedding. Upon check in we were rather abruptly informed that although breakfast ran until 9.30 (slightly early for a weekend I would say), we couldn't actually go at 9.30 because too many other people were going at that time. Fine, we will go a little earlier, but not exactly off to a good start.   We're shown to our room. It was clearly recently refurbished, although the contrast between modern soft furnishings and hap hazard old wooden furniture (one set of drawers even having all silver handles apart from one gold) did not go unnoticed. The bed was nice, if a little soft and not to our personal taste.   We noticed we had a coffee machine in our room. A nice addition I thought, especially since they noted in their guest book that decaffeinated pods were available on request and I'm currently trying to stay caffeine free. They're not, and we were told never have been, although the abrupt female owner of the establishment was exceptionally keen to tell us how we had been upgraded to a suite that normally cost £150 a night.   Well I'm not sure what one normally expects from a bed and breakfast. We had a bed, storage, tv, kettle, shower, toilet, sink, mirror. Maybe the double in cost from £75 to £150 was for a coffee machine, a sofa and a second tv, none of which in my opinion add very much value.   What one does normally expect, from even the most basic of establishments, is a hot shower, at a time of one's choosing. However, the owner, despite knowing that many of his guests were attending a wedding that afternoon chose to switch both the hot water and heating off at 10am that day. So, with my sore back that is made worse by the cold, I started in a hot shower and finished rather quickly in a cold shower in a cold room.   The second day we arrived at breakfast at 9.30am. Again, we were abruptly asked what we would like, 'because as you know we stop serving at 9.30'. Yes, that is why we are here at 9.30. If you wish your guests to be finished by 9.30, maybe you should advertise that it runs until 9. Although that would horrify many guests on a weekend. Clearing up around your guests who did arrive at 9.30 whilst they ate just seemed to represent the owners making a point and was quite unnecessary.   Breakfast was average. The cold selection was somewhat limited and although the full English was nice, as was the smoked salmon with eggs, the whole breakfast was rather let down by thin and tasteless bread that dissolved under any topping.   Paying £75 a night for this place, I was disappointed, considering the cold shower and lack of heating in November. If I had paid £150 a night I would have been distraught. Will never return and would certainly not recommend to friends or family. 
-2; we were directed to a room behind reception. In fact two rooms both with TV's on we waited a while and then had to go back to reception to ask for some service. Eventually someone came and showed us to a table directly below the Tv and opposite to the bar. NOT GOOD. We were not offered champagne which we had booked for and had to ask. The barman didn't know if the champagne was very dry or not so we elected for prosecco. My partner asked for his tea after we had eaten. After our plated sandwiches arrived we never saw anyone again. We did ascertain if we wanted more sandwiches we could have them, but since we didn't see anyone that option was not given. We eventually had to go and find someone to pay the bill. 
-2; Unfortunately, me and my boyfriend didn't have a great experience at this hotel. Furniture in the room in chipped, which isn't something you expect when the hotel is 4 stars. There was also a light bulb missing in the room and you could see the wires. After quite a long journey we decided to get room service and it took quite a number of calls (I think 5?) before anyone answered. I didn't have cash on me so went downstairs to pay by card. The price for our food was £24 and instead of just paying that amount, I had to do a pre-payment of £30 and pay the exact amount when we left. This seemed pointless to me as we were only staying one night. Most staff were very polite, but I did have a member of staff get snappy with me. If a customer annoys you, that's fine, but I don't think you should ever show your annoyance.   Positives are that breakfast was great and the staff at breakfast really were excellent. The bed we slept in was also super comfy, but overall there was too many disappointing occurrences to give this hotel a good review. 
-2; I booked this hotel as we wanted a city getaway for a couple of days. Having stayed at other Novotels and seen decent reviews, I booked for 2 nights, via Laterooms.   The room itself, a superior double was fine, just as expected and i thought it was good for £174 for 2 nights.The room and hotel were clean, well maintained and generally, our stay would have been good if it weren't for Novotel's errors in taking payment for the room when we arrived, despite Laterooms 'ringfencing' the funds before we'd arrived. This meant my account showing 2 x £174 as being unavailable for the time we we've been here. The hotel staff member claimed this would be debited back to my account within days but I'm not impressed as this has never happened in the many hotels in which we've stayed and also, shouldn't this have been checked before they took my money? I've had to jump through hoops to try to get the money back (still waiting but we checked in last night so will see). Not impressed with the service in this sense and we've not had one apology for the inconvenience and embarrassment of having my card declined due to 'insufficient funds' being in the account when we went shopping in Leeds.  The room service menu after hours is very poor,maybe 2 options. As it's a business hotel rather than leisure, maybe that's to be expected so anyway, called for room service to be told they aren't processing orders until 8.30pm. Ok. Waited until 8.30 and called with our order, asking for the dessert to be brought up separately as I didn't want the ice cream hotel to melt! Was told that all items would be brought on one tray. No effort, no nothing. Just a bit crap really. Maybe this is just how Novotel operates.  Overall, I'm gad we didn't pay the full price for the room (should have been £169 per night) but I definitely wouldn't stay here again. We didn't expect the Ritz, it is what it is but good customer service goes a long way with me and for us, it's been lacking. 
-2; Stayed overnight here as had a business conference to attend on 10th Dec. It started off with a friendly check-in but then the room was very average and a bit pokey, rubbish shower with hardly any pressure. Great porter who helped me open my window as it was stuck and I couldn't budge it. I went down for cooked breakfast (which was included in the room rate) in the morning and was really looking forward to it....what a let-down...everything was luke warm as lids left open on the bain-maries , fried eggs not cooked properly and could still see the jelly in the white of them and the scrambled eggs looked sludgy and extremely unappetising, bacon was swimming in grease.... so went without. Asked the waitress for another teabag as huge pot with just one in there, she said she didn't understand me then when I tried to explain the tea was very weak she walked off with a sigh and then came back and literally threw 3 down on my table. Really disappointing and wouldn't stay again. Surprising as I have stayed with the Millenium chain before and always had a pleasant experience. They may think because it's London they don't have to rely on repeating trade I suppose! 
-2; We went with two 12 yr olds, 8 month old baby, and a couple of friends who had four yr old twins and a new born. We chose gold due to the age of the babies hoping to be of a decent standard and size. You could barely fit either of our families into each apartment, our room in which we would of had to put travelcot had a window, at which we found out at 3 in the morning at night, had a gap around it of at least 2 inch's which resorted in us and our baby having NO SLEEP due to the cold. We informed gold services of this problem first thing, along with our friends who had had the same problem with the kids room. We were advised it move our cot into the hall way, and our friends were just given an apology and we were both told there was no other accomadation available. After the second night of this problem, they handed there keys in and went home, which is what we would of done apart from our 12yr old didnt want to go as the resort it self was good, costly but good!  Not only we had the problem with windows but the lack of space available was poor to say the least! We could not all fit in the living space/kitchen at the same time. Sofa's tiny and feet almost touching the t.v.   As an extra in gold you are given a personal safe, on our evening of arrival, we put our childrens spending money, sat nav and camera's in the safe. When we tried to open it in the morning, we were left with a safe telling us we had the wrong pin, (which was my dob) again we ended up in gold services (which wasted even more time of our holiday!?!?!) The staff were polite and apologetic which was fine at first apart from it took 17 hours to finally break into the back of it meaning we had 10 hrs left of our holiday and no pics of our stay. So we decided to go home sunday night instead of monday morning.  The staff, venue itself, activities are quite good for early teens. The food ok depending on where you go ( do not try the chip shop yuck!). The main problem we have is my partner worked here in '98. The accomadtion as gold now, was there then looking the same as it does now, it needs to be better.  Not much free stuff to do..... almost EVERYTHING you have to pay extra for....even the sand diggers for toddler's you now have to pay ( which was free 2 yrs ago ).  As a family with a age spread children who holiday's in England ( plane no no ) I think we will have to try a different resort.....purely as accomadtion is the 1st most important thing on a holiday! 
-2; At check in we were advised that children were not allowed in the pool after 7pm. This is not uncommon in hotels, and I accept that some choose to do this. However this is not documented anywhere on the Legoland holidays site or the hotels main website - which seems a little unfair and even misleading to have this as a feature of the hotel knowing that many guests visiting Legoland will not be reaching a hotel until around this time. We reached our room and found that the key card did not work - after returning to reception we discovered they had written the wrong room number of the paperwork. We were trying to get into someone else's room! Again, mistakes are made and human error happens, but it became clear this was an indication of things to come. Once we entered the room we had been given we were speechless. The room was an attic style room, a window that opened a couple of inches with a view of a brick wall. The room was very warm - although not a particularly warm evening - and there was no way of allowing any air flow through. Housekeeping had seen the reservation was for a triple room and moved the furniture to 'accommodate' the third bed. The double bed was pushed to the corner of the room and the two bedside tables both placed on one side. The meant that for the person expected to crawl into bed (directly next to the wall) their head was touching the wall fixed bedside lamp. Not only was this ridiculous to expect someone to do this, but also dangerous. The roll away bed was situation in the only vacant position at the foot of the double bed, leaving a very narrow passage to access the tiny one person bathroom. The floor had not been vacuumed since the last guests, as there was glitter and sequins all over it. The three of us struggled to actually access the room with our overnight bags. We returned to reception to ask them to move the furniture and vacuum. The duty manager immediately apologised that they were full, so unable to move us to another room. The response of the duty manager indicated that this was not an unusual complaint and he went on to warn us that as there was a wedding there that evening, there would be loud music. It was too late with a young child to look to do anything else at that point, so resigned ourselves to the situation. We have stayed in many hotels were other functions were happening and have not been disturbed by them - it is very commonplace after all. We were then advised that the restaurant was full, but we were welcome to order at the bar. We entered the bar, but there was nowhere to sit. We asked the staff for a menu, and were told that they didn't have any, but would go and get some from other guests outside on the patio. Once we eventually ordered some food (basic food) it then took a further 40 minutes to arrive. It was now after 8.30pm with a young child - no apology for the delay in serving food.  We got to bed we were significantly disturbed through until about 2am by music, voices on mic's and then a disco. We could feel the bass thumping through the bed and the fittings were actually shaking. Then came the other guests returning to their rooms - shouting down the corridors and having drunken conversations. We were kept awake and then disturbed frequently through the night. When morning arrived we were keen to get through breakfast and get out of there - to resume our enjoyable break at Legoland. Even breakfast was difficult - taking 30 minutes and 4 requests for a peppermint tea to be delivered. The general state of the hotel is not that of a 4 star and the staff - although pleasant - are not well equipped or trained to offer a professional service. There were other smaller issues that seem too petty to mention, but altogether the experience was horrible. I would advise you not to go! 
-2; Visited for Afternoon Tea. I had some vouchers for 6 but wanted to purchase an extra one too. When ordering I explained this however when it was served they only brought 6. I asked again for the extra one to be told I only had vouchers for 6 so explained I was purchasing an extra one. The staff were overheard arguing over how many I wanted! Had to wait 20 minutes for the extra one.  Asked for more tea and didn't arrive! The cakes all seemed to be prebought and not homemade which was disappointing.  Overall experience was quite poor which was a shame as we had been looking forward to visiting 
-2; We went to a Mayoral Gala Dinner/Ball but were disappointed with both the venue and food.  There was noone to receive your coats and you were left to hang up your own coat on a rack with open access to anyone. I really did not feel happy having to leave my expensive velvet evening cloak there but there was nowhere else to put it.  The dining area was nicely set out but the 20+ tables were crammed extremely close together - far too many people in one room which I considered probably breached fire regulations.   Each person had to wait until the person immediately behind them pulled in their chair so that they could then pull out their own chair to sit down.  The food was mundane and the vegetables were served on your plate along with the meat instead of in dishes on the table as one would expect of such a venue. Portions were small too.  Our desserts came after our coffee. All in all - not very good. 
-2;It's soooo over rated..... Would not have been happy if I'd have paid full price !  Not the most helpful receptionist !  The room was very dark and the window smaller than a newspaper, the huge bronze blinds were all bent and broken and had dead flys behind it ! Yuk !  No shower gel , but nice monsoon shower head !  Room service was awful , on basic chicken and garlic mash , was cold and the mash was basic with no garlic as advertised and tasted like packet smash ! You couldn't leave a debit card for extras and had to pay cash only for food ! Would I stay here again ........mmmmm no , even if the price went down from £110 to £80 !
-2; We stayed for two nights. I have recommend the Angel to visitors several times. We were told we had the last available room and thought this was why it was so disappointing. The window was painted white so we could not see out. This was because there is a public car park in front of the Angel. If one cannot see out to the beautiful Abbey gate and Athenaum in the middle of this fantastic town, then the price should NOT be £183 per night (no breakfast included). These are London prices. We do not mind paying for good hotels if one feels the value is good. We felt ripped off here. Most of The Angel is 17th Century so we thought we would be in one of these rooms. We will not stay here again nor recommend to friends. We have been told the Chancery Hotel nearby is far less expensive. 
-2; Nutfield Priory seems to market itself as being a luxury stay so I was expecting good things on a rare night away from the children.   First appearances were good, it is in a lovely location but things quickly went down hill. Although we had arrived 30 minutes after allocated check in time, our room wasn't ready. We were then told we could upgrade to a room that was ready-but would have to pay an extra £30 to do this!! No real apology for the delays.   We politely declined and got put in the bar for a drink while our room was finished. After 20 minutes no one came back to find us so we had to go and ask if our room was now ready. The room was clean, but nothing special.  We went to the spa, which is really disappointing. The pool is like something in your local town and in the changing rooms there were piles of towels everywhere.   At drinks before dinner, our drinks order was forgotten and we had to chase this up. Then no one came to collect us for dinner - we had to ask if our table was ready.   Then our starters were brought out before we had even been served our drinks. We asked for rolls and were told these were coming as they were being cooked.   At breakfast the next morning our coffee arrived after our cooked breakfast. I had ordered poached eggs and these arrived before the toast!   Overall a very average stay, service was poor and no one had thought - or seemed to care about the little details that make a night away special. There were no major issues, just a combinations of lots of small issues that mean that I wouldn't return or recommend.    
-2; Room dirty and hot. Staff not helpful.treatments all fully booked.would NOT recommend.location not bad but very poor reception for youngster on her first holiday away.they were taken advantage of and placed in the gods of the hotel 
-2; My husband and I stayed at The Feversham Arms to celebrate my birthday. We had stayed approx 4 years previous and thoroughly enjoyed our stay, promising to return again.  Our main complaint is regarding the 'holding charge' when we checked in. £350 was charged to our debit card and we main the assumption this would be held for the length of our stay, then released once we checked out. This was not the case, it took 7 days for the money to return to our account. At no point was this mentioned to us. I have never stayed in a hotel before where a holding charge has been taken, never mind one which was a similar price to our night's stay given we had already paid a deposit. When my husband called the hotel to ask how long the money would be held for and to enquire why this was not fully explained to us on check-in, he did not receive the apology he expected. Instead the manager he spoke to (Antonio) shifted the blame to our bank, stating it was their responsibility to reimburse the money to our account.  We felt disappointed with the decor in our bathroom (Room 23). The knob which is twisted to put the plug up and down in the bath was broken. Rather than fix it, it had been replaced with a plastic sucker with a hook on. This didn't always work and I didn't think this was acceptable when we had paid £300+ for a junior suite. The bathroom tiles were black slate, but in many places, especially the shower were covered in what looked like limescale.  Although we received excellent service from the staff in the restaurant, we waited over 20mins to be asked whether we'd like a drink, which was after prompting the waiter. There were just not enough staff to cover all the guests present.  Given the price of a stay at this hotel, we visited for an occasion and considered our stay a treat. The situation with the holding charge hung over us for a week until the money was returned to our account. Overall, we were sadly disappointed by a stay we had been really looking forward to and I regret to say, we won't be returning. Such a shame when we'd held this hotel in such high regarding following our first stay. 
-2;" Being a fan of the Laura Ashley style, it was no surprise that I was excited to visit a Laura Ashley hotel.  Bar the initial welcome and the grounds, everything else left me feeling cold.  Breakfast left a lot to be desired; for £350 a night I expect a better variety of breakfast choices. The scrambled eggs didn't appeal to me, I like mine more well done, but when I did try some of the &quot;warm&quot; food it was stone cold. We got down to the breakfast room at 8am, breakfast finished at 9:30.  Now onto the room; beautifully decorated, amazing view over the gardens. The heating didn't work efficiently for my needs. I get cold quickly so needed a lot of warmth, the radiator rarely worked and when it did it was just to say on.  We stayed in the newer part of the building which I felt was better suited to business customers, with the conference rooms being seated near where are rooms were. It was uncomfortable passing by the business meetings everyday.   I feel that the needs of the everyday family clientele had been pushed to one side to prioritise the needs of business and wedding clients.  Promised the world, did not deliver. Will not stay again.  "
-2; As a local we visited the Llawnroc for sunday lunch, ordered 2 drinks at the bar on arrival and immediately sent the bitter back as it tasted way past its best, we were then shown to our table and we ordered a starter, which was excellent but took 40 minutes to appear. the main course arrived on stone cold plates which was pork with two small pencil sized pieces of parsnip and four similar sized pieces of carrot, the waitress then brought us one very small bowl between 2 of broccoli and cauliflower which was also stone cold. By this time we gave up and paid the bill and was asked if things were ok! when we expressed our views we were promised a deal for our next visit and would be contacted but this has not materialised 
-2; We stayed at this hotel in June 2010 to celebrate our wedding anniversary & found the the entrance unwelcoming, staff at reception not over friendly & the whole hotel dark & depressing. We had the largest luxury suite overlooking the bridge but there were ripped voiles with cigarette burn holes, tie back hooks hanging off the wall cuplboards dusty & feel it certainly was not worth the room price, the only plus was the wet room & bose cd player but the evening meal was awful, salmon literally floating in pickled onions we would NOT stay here again .... an expensive mistake :o( 
-2; The hotel itself is all round poor .. the only good parts were the brilliant treatments in the limited spa and the bar & lounge was very well served .. the food there was 10 times better than the restaurant .. the bar staff were pleasant & helpful .. polite & courteous .. only exception was to be able to hear wages & contracts being discussed by a rather loud 'boss' .. surely an office in private would be better .. The prices in the bar are extortionate .. be prepared ..   My single room was tired .. lacked the niceties one expects these days .. poor shower .. no tissues .. inaccessible refreshments .. no biscuits ..  The spa was very small .. no relaxation rooms but the treatments were by far the best I have had recently .. particularly the back massage .. well done to the therapists ..  By far the worst experience of the whole place was the restaurant .. cold, stale food .. wilting salad leaves .. biggest tip .. take your own tea bags ..   Overall .. I wouldn't come here again even on a 'deal' .. there is better quality around for the same price ..  
-2; The hotel itself is ugly on the outside, we thought the inside would make up for it but unfortunately not. Poor dated and tatty decor, looked like it needed a good clean. Checked in, no complaints about staff.  The room was large and airy but still dated, in the bathroom the heated towel rail had wires hanging out, very unsafe. The view well it was of the outside bar area. We went down to the bar, the poor lad behind the bar didn't seem to have sufficient training as was unable to make a cocktail on the list and even stated he has never made it before, therefore swiftly changed my drink order. But he was pleasant, we couldn't fault the staff, they were working in the only conditions they could. Evening meal was mehh, only reason we ate in was due to the fact we were both drinking. Breakfast was also meh, so we swiftly left. 
-2;My partner booked the hotel for my birthday. He booked a Deluxe double so would have hated to see a standard. Not enough room to swing a cat. Carpet was dirty and a boiled sweet found on the floor. Bed was comfortable and facilities enough. Definitely not a room to spend time in. On leaving hotel we were later phoned accused of smoking in the room because a neighbour had apparently said so! Will stick with what we know in future. They need to learn off hotel du vin.
-2; I feel disappointment from our stay on Friday night (5th February). We booked the deal via groupon and did feel that for the most part we were treated slightly different to those guests paying normal rates.  On arrival we were slightly early (30 mins) we were told our room wasn't ready and check-in was not until 3pm - however other guests arriving were able to check in without problem. When we were able to check in we were asked loudly for the groupon voucher and also not as much information given on hotel facilities, although we had luckily heard from other check ins.  Before booking I checked the spa facilities as I only use a whirlpool and don't swim, this was confirmed however on arrival it was out of order.   The room was ok but in need of an update as it does look dated but the problems we had were noise. The walls were so thin we could hear a noise which we now believe could of been a Jacuzzi bath in the next room? Also we heard every time someone went to the toilet. Again not really what we would expect and not something we have experienced before in high end accommodation.  The food in the restaurant at dinner was lovely and the staff very attentive however breakfast was a let down the cooked buffet breakfast being lukewarm.   On checking out we noticed the couple in front being asked if they had enjoyed their stay and if they had any problems, we were not asked for feedback, I feel just because we booked a deal via groupon we were treated lesser than regular guests. A cocktail bar is advertised however it is merely a lounge bar not an actual cocktail bar.   I would not recommend the hotel and will be considering other hotels in the area for the future. 
-2; Beautiful location and very impressive from outside unfortunately dull and dingy inside. Staff were pleasant and welcoming Bedroom on ground floor was clean and comfortable but also reflected the dull dingy image with poor lighting and heavy net curtains. Evening meal and service on first night of stay was excellent. Breakfast on second morning service was poor and staff appeared disorganized coffee and toast order did not materialise despite other tables arriving after us,being served promptly, had to re order then wait again, order for top up coffee failed to appear. 
-2; I bought a Groupon spa and afternoon tea day for me and my cousin and rang the hotel to book in for my Birthday. When we arrived on the day we stated our names at the spa reception but they said they had no booking for us, they asked if we could take a seat in the waiting area, not long after someone came over to say they had me in for the next month! I couldn't believe they had booked me in for the same date but the wrong month! They hadn't sent me any email confirmation, luckily they were able to fit us in and the members of staff on the day were very helpful trying to still get us fitted in for my Birthday. The spa area is a main pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna with 4 chairs (which wasn't enough as there were more people to chairs and no where to relax) The massage treatments were wonderful and relaxing I would definitely recommend coming in for a massage or treatment here. However if you are looking for a relaxing adult spa day in a pool/jacuzzi this is not the place to go. They were running different classes throughout the day such as aqua aerobics, kids swimming lessons and group mother and baby swimming classes so it definitely wasn't a peaceful relaxing atmosphere. During our day the other customers were complaining about the sauna room being too hot to stay in, then the alarm started going off (also not very relaxing) and not long after the staff tested the heat of the room and put an out of order sign on the door. The afternoon tea came out all soggy and wet, I don't know why it all seemed to be swimming in water, the sandwiches had gotten wet and stuck together and the cheesecake was very wet including the biscuit base. 
-2; We have stayed in many a guest house, but this was not one of the better ones, let alone a good hotel. We were greeted by Marco on our arrival. However it was very brief - we were given the key to our room with directions and told that if we needed any assistance we should go back outside and ring the front doorbell. This in the wind and rain. The entrance hall, which also served as the lounge, didn't strike us as particularly warm on entering. When we reached our attic bedroom that was far from warm. It was a large room heated by an electric wall heater/radiator, which doesn't appear to be man enough for the job. We were disappointed by the furnishings in the room which were tired and grubby. The carpets in the bedroom and bathroom were very faded and badly stained. The curtains were cheap and old. The bed was a good size and comfortable. However, the divan itself, which sat inside the bedstead was very stained and no effort has been made to cover it with a valance. We slept badly due to being too cold. The shower over the bath was by means of a mixer tap, so the shower would intermittently change from super hot to cold, which made for a very uncomfortable shower. The toiletries provided were nothing like in the photos but rather some cheap looking tubes of ECO soap. Breakfast was not a lot better. The dining room was again cold, despite it housing a large wood-burner which was not lit. The continental buffet was sadly lacking. One plate of cheese slices and another with one slice of ham on it. A few mini danish pastries sat on another plate. More than once the guests had to ask for the plates to be replenished as there was simply not enough laid out, even though we had come down to breakfast in good time. This was somewhat embarrassing. Our coffee arrived cold, so had to be returned to the kitchen. And I had to request croissants, which when they arrived were tiny. There was one lady on breakfast duty, and she appeared to be responsible for replenishing the plates, bringing out drinks and clearing tables. It was obviously too much for her to handle alone. We could see that maybe they were trying to aim for Italian shabby chic, but to be honest our stay just felt cold and shabby. When we left there was no inquiry as to whether we had enjoyed our stay, or whether we had been comfortable. This may be a lovely place to stay in the summer, but avoid during the colder winter months as you will not be comfortable here. It appears they are trying to cut corners to keep costs down? Outside the gates was a sign indicating that the hotel housed a Trattoria, though we saw no evidence of this at all and had to scour the local villages for somewhere to eat. There was a conservatory housing tables and chairs, but bizarrely this was being used by two young girls in their dressing gowns who appeared to be painting a bedstead . This property is not as described or as shown in the photos. It is in a lovely setting, very peaceful and picturesque. That is all,in our opinion, it has going for it. 
-2; Arrived at the hotel and the receptionist was extremely rude. Room was dirty with stains on the floor. Wifi didn't work and the TV had very limited channels and terrible signal so you could barely watch it. Extremely thin walls so you can hear everything going on it rooms either side. Tram line next to the hotel is very noisy. 
-2; Okay so this is a nice location, if a little out of the way....nice view, if you are on the right side of the hotel and very pleasant staff who are clearly well-trained and have good morale. I stayed for just one night for early London meetings and the fatal flaw was that the shower did not supply any hot water. I tried the usual tricks, letting it run for a while and waiting for my shower but nothing....a cold to lukewarm dribble. I called reception, they said that they would find me another room in which to take my shower...but I was in a towel, it was 6.15am and I didn't want to go parading through the hotel for a shower....so I had a cold shower. April was cold this year and so was I.  As I checked out the customer service person did come over and knew about the situation, she handed me her card, apologised and said if I return, she would make sure that this did not happen. This is fine but it should not have happened....a good bed and a good shower are the basics....this was lacking. As I said, staff were really nice and tried to make it right....but I was sorely disappointed, not to mention cold.... 
-2; I stayed here on a friday night with my husband after a work outing to the cricket. Location wise its easy to get to, city centre birmingham and there was a car park but we didnt need to use it. It was £38 for the night which is obviously very cheap so i wasnt expecting much (my husband booked it)  The reception was nice and the staff very friendly and check in as efficient. The room was quite dated and abit tired but overall was fine. When we stayed it was very hot so there was a small portable airconditioning unit in the room, which wasnt brilliant but better than nothing. Our room was overlooking the paradise circus walkway which has a bar on and there was live music blasting until the early hours which was not great for us. It was imoossible to sleep with the level of noise. Generally ok budget hotel, if you stop there i would recommend asking for a room on the front of the hotel so you are further from the bar/noise. If you are planning ln getting back to your room after 3 am it would probably be fine because it is quiter then! 
-2; We were very much looking forward to a ‘romantic weekend’ at Frimley Park Hotel through a Buyagift voucher for our wedding anniversary. When booking, there was only Executive rooms left so we didn’t mind paying the extra £35 to treat ourselves.  The actual hotel looks lovely from the outside and the reception area is very grand. However, our room was very disappointing. It just had a general drab tired feel to it, the blinds were all down at 3pm in the afternoon and when we opened them, we just had a view of the kitchen. The bed looked like a standard double and there was nothing at all ‘executive’ about the room. I love rooms with character and that’s what we were expecting, but this room was missing that.  We were there for a spa weekend so just headed straight there to find it absolutely packed. There were no loungers free at all and the pool was full of kids and very noisy – not quite the ‘romantic spa weekend’ we had in mind. We would have been better off heading to a gym with facilities for the day and paid much less, especially as there was no hot tub/Jacuzzi anyway.  The food we had in the Linden restaurant was absolutely lovely and I cannot fault that, however, due to the room and spa, I would never come back again and won’t be recommending it to anyone else. Such a shame as I have heard good things about MacDonald hotels, just not in this case.  
-2;Desperately needs refurbished, wallpaper was hanging off and looked like it hadn't been updated since the 70s!  Room clean but again desperately needed updated and bed was very uncomfortable. Bathroom small but fine. Didn't go into the spa so can't comment on that. Breakfast was awful and majority of hot breakfast buffet was stone cold. Only stayed for one night and glad as wouldn't have wanted to stay another.
-2; the room was clean, well it appeared to be. the staff were average. location was nice, with a view of the beach. it was very noisy, the beds were uncomfy. the room was pretty dated but had the essentials. when my friends parents asked for the a comfier mattress they didnt get round to it  we left early due to the fact that they were not sleeping. 
-2; I stayed in a twin room where the beds are very small and the sheets don't fit the bed properly. The pillows are thin and hard, should have been replaced years ago. The main reason for my rating though is the breakfast. As a vegetarian I don't have high expectations of hotel breakfasts so when saw beans, hash browns , mushrooms and eggs I thought great! Then my friend asked what they were cooked in. The response was that only the hash browns were vegetarian. Everything else was cooked in animal fat! It's 2016. Who does that. Very disappointed in the Mercure. 
-2; Stayed two nights on Friday 13th and Sat 14th June. We had dinner in the Brasserie and we were shocked at how dreadful the service was. We ordered main dishes which were very disappointing. We waited for someone to clear our dirty plates, even making eye contact several times with the waiting staff however no one arrived to our table. We stayed and finished our wine and by this time we were one of the only tables left in the restaurant but still no service. We were not asked if we'd like dessert or a coffee. We got up and left about 40 mins later with dirty plates still on the table and tracked down a member of staff at reception to settle our bill. Wouldn't recommend staying here as its an expensive break and we found the all round service to be very poor, not just in the brasserie. 
-2;" Oh dear- I'm afraid our experience wasn't too good and would not stay here again. On arrival our room (110) was very cold and although large it looked as if it was still awaiting extra furniture- we only had one hard upright chair. Bed was very comfortable though. We were eating in the County Restaurant after the champagne reception-we did have one glass of champagne in the champagne bar before the reception and were very surprised to find &quot;table service only&quot; and then charged over £4.00 for the drink to be brought to us. The service in the restaurant was very slow though I enjoyed the food. After dining we went through to enjoy some music and dancing-nowhere to sit!-and when we went to our room at 12.45 couldn't believe how loud the music was below us. The volume wouldn't have been such a problem as was the loud distorted bass. The music did finish at 0200 am which we expected but then we were woken up again around 4am to lots of noise when obviously staff were clearing up from the evening's entertainment. Next morning we had to wait 30 mins for a table for breakfast and then about 40 mins to be served-my breakfast was cold but I couldn't be bothered to complain by then. One of us ordered tea to drink and was brought a cup of hot water with a teabag in the saucer. When we queried this we were told they had run out of teapots !! We did complain to reception when checking out and I must say we did receive some compensation. We would have much rather paid the full price and not to have had to complain. Sorry but we wont be returning. "
-2; I booked a queen bed with sofa, my room was two single beds and a chair!  The bath room was a disabled one, very height toilet, low bath and sinks. I'm not sure if all the bathrooms are like this in the other rooms. The room was very minimal and in need of updating.  As we arrived late I didn't query the room, upon checking out I was told, yes a queen size bed is sometimes two single ones pushed together!  Not impressed at all. Breakfast area busy but food was fine, plenty of choice. Don't sit near the door where the staff are throwing cutlery into a draw. Very noisy. 
-2;" We paid £110 to stay in a &quot;standard&quot; double room. This had no window - was positioned next to their bins outside. Staff were outside out room and were very loud. Room was tiny. When I complained we were told there was nothing they could do and didnt seem to care anyway - never again!! Also £20 a night to park - rip off. "
-2; We purchased a voucher from living social for a spa day and so pleased we didn't pay full price!!The pool area and sauna etc were in desperate need of refurbishment,we also had lunch there and decided to eat in the conservetary when we went for lunch the staff totally ignored us and we had to ask we're to sit and if we could have a menu we were still waiting 35 mins later so decided to leave and eat near the pool area.The full body massage we had was wonderful and the staff in the beauty room were lovely.On leaving we handed our robes back in and the girl on the desk was so busy on the phone to someone else talking about what times she was working that week that she mooned for us to put the robes down on the side.Would definitely not go back again was really disappointed when we expected to have such a lovely day!! 
-2; I stayed at the Jury Inn Waterfront for 3 nights with my boyfriend and on arrival we were greeted by an unfriendly receptionist. After travelling for a gruelling 6 hours on the train, it was probably not the welcome we wanted to start off our trip in Brighton. She was impatient and came across as a rude character, she didn't offer any information about the local area, and more importantly the amenities in the hotel, such as the restaurant and the gym. When we got to the room, it was slightly disappointing, as the room was very average for the price and we weren't expecting to overlook the restaurant area of the hotel and we had to keep the curtains closed a lot of the time to get any privacy. The bathroom door didn't close properly and the lights on the wall were broken. We didn't feel like we fully got our money's worth from this hotel, however the room service staff were very prompt at following up any requests we had and the cleaners did a very good job of making the rooms immaculate. 
-2; Overall: room for improvement. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds which are also the golf course. The food in the main restaurant was fantastic - but the service was shocking! It took almost 3hrs for a 3 course meal to be served (on all 4 nights), despite complaints and suggestions for improvement the kind waitress told us that they were under staffed... another waiter was later seen checking security around the 'pool & wet areas. The first room I was given was small, dark and at the very back of the hotel. The second was bigger & brighter but smelt distinctly off. The plug in my shower/bath was blocked & reception notified - but nothing was done about it. 
-2; Do not book the Christmas break unless you want to spend 3 days contemplating your navel. The staff are great and the rooms are nice but it was the most boring Christmas I have ever had in my entire life the Oxford hotels website was very misleading. 
-2; Husband booked Day Spa for both of us and we received a confirmation email stating that the cost would include treatments with an upgrade value of £35. Booked a couple of treatments (1 hedeously overpriced £55 pedicure....but went ahead thinking it would be fine for the £20 extra we'd have to pay) Pedicure was distinctly average and not on a-par with treatments that are delivered at local nail salon - very disappointing. On check out, was shocked to be charged for the full amount and upon querying the charges was told by a dismissive Reservations Manager and patronising General Manager that the clause in the confirmation email didn't apply to our package. Spa itself OK, tired looking and in need of maintenance. If you're looking for a day spa, I'd suggest Nirvana in Reading or PennyHill Park in Bagshot. Food however was very good. Most disappointed and won't be returning. 
-2; Don't like moaning but have to put down comments so ot prevent other weary Ridgeway walkers facign the same experiences. We booked atwin room but got a double and when we queried this they separated the beds eventually adn resheeted tehm infront of us adn really badly. A good approach would have been to offer us a free drink a the bar whislt the room was sorted. We were wet adn cold adn extremely tired after walking 17 miles of the Ridgeway. The TV did not work, eventually sorted, the toilet seat fell off adn the toilet was impossible to flush. We ordered room service which did come quickly 9 very mediocre food) with the ice-cream dessert already half melted on the same tray as the main. The manager on duty did try his hardest and after suggesting a reduction did agree with free food but by then we were fed up.  This was the most expensive room of our Ridgeway walk ( 7 days ) by far and we were expecting something better for the price. The pubs we had stayed in the previous nights had been far cheaper and offered a far superior service. Start by showing people to their room like the others adn this helps so much especially when you can see how wert and tired we were. 
-2;" Took my mother out for dinner. We were so looking forward to it but were disappointed with the food. The trout, as you would expect was good. The vegetables were terrible, described as 'seasonal' with new potatoes, in my elderly mothers words they were 'a disgrace'; virtually raw with no flavour at all. At a time when beans, courgettes, tomatoes, carrots etc etc a in season, hard boiled (very possibly) microwaved broccoli and cauliflower were served together with hard potatoes with absolutely no flavour or seasoning. The pity is that with little additional skill, a few seasonal herbs ( mint, parsley etc) some seasoning with a desire to be the best you can a half decent meal could be achieved.  Expressing my concerns was met with &quot; no one else has minded&quot;. "
-2; Stayed here for 4 nights for business. I was given a room by the lift so was not best pleased. Being a female alone I was nervous anytime anyone walked passed the door so this location did not help Like everything else in this hotel it was 'ok' but not ideal. The reception staff were only ok. The room was hot with no aircon. There was no environmental initiative regarding towels or bedding. There was no customer satisfaction survey that you tend to get in hotels these days. There is a 'fitness suite' which looks scruffy. On the treadmill you can't see who has come in to the room, so, again, I found this uncomfortable. £8 a day for wifi which is free in other hotels. Room smelled musty and paintwork is scruffy. Premier Inn beats this by miles! 
-2;Choose this hotel due to our son getting married at a nearby location, we booked a superior room. The room we were given was in our opinion a standard room. We double checked this hotels website and the size of the room we were given was the same size as the standard room, decor was the same also. We went back to reception and after a long discussion with the receptionist trying to tell us it was a superior room our room was then change. The room they change us to was bigger and the same as the superior room advertised on the website. Before we checked in we had lunch in the bar with some wedding guests who then brought us a bottle of wine and asked at reception for this to be sent to our room as a surprise. Our friends then learnt that our room had been changed so notified reception that the wine need so be changed also. We did not receive this wine and it wasn't until the wedding the next day when we were asked if we enjoyed the wine that we realised we should have had wine delivered. Our friend did telephone the hotel and this was waiting for us we we returned. The spa is nice but it is a shame that they allow children in the jacuzzi and steam room, not very relaxing. The food is very good and the staff In Both the restaurant and bar were very nice and service was good. Unfortunately although we would happily return to the restaurant and bar we would not stay at this hotel again.
-2;I had to stay here one night for a business trip as the hotel is wanted to stay in was full.  Considering it supposed to be a Hilton you wouldn't think it when you look round at the dirty and broken furniture. Or the black duck tape on the side of the lift. I had to rush to get changed for a meeting so tried to order room service but nobody answered the phone. Had to go through hoops and pay £15 to get WiFi in my room.  After being out most of the day my colleagues and I wanted a few drinks in the bar beautiful were told it shut at 11pm. I couldn't make a drink in my room as there wasn't anywhere to plug the kettle. Would NOT recommend this hotel. There's loads more nicer and cheaper around milton Keynes.
-2;" Stayed here twice before so I suppose we should have known better. Booked a one night break B & B with garden view. 4th floor room VERY tired. Peeling wallpaper and bathroom not good. Positive point was the room was very big and we did have garden view but bearing in mind Premier Inn also shares views of the same garden......! Lowest quality iron (supposedly steam) leaked so clothes were left soaking wet!! Not good when getting ready to go out for dinner. Definitely wasn't value for money at £114 - half that would have been a fair price to pay. It's sad that this once grand &quot;Majestic&quot; hotel doesn't live up to its name. Won't return. "
-2; On check in I was told the double room I had booked had been upgraded to an executive room which I thought was nice. Seemed to be signs everywhere stating do not smoke which is great....yet the porter who came to help me with my luggage smelt like he had slept with an ashtray for a year, so bad I so that I said I didn't need his help would rather struggle up the stairs with my own luggage. On entering my room I was hugely disappointed - I know they are decorating the hotel so I must have got the only room not touched with a decorators brush. I believe I was given a downgrade....I booked a double room I now had two single beds....I don't want a ruddy single bed . Checked with reception no doubles available!!!!!!!!. The bed single turned out to be the worst I have ever slept in, I reckon it has got to be at least 60yes old - shocking really. The shower took an age to give me hot water then decided to cut out before I had finished which was interesting as I had to try and finish washing my hair in the bath using a glass!!!!  The breakfast was I believe poor quality buffet, tinned mushrooms, sloppy scrambled eggs, burnt soggy bacon.....sausage was nice and not a bad 'cold' selection. Overall sadly the hotel did not live up to the glossy Internet impression it gave. 
-2; This is the first time i'm writing a review as i felt it was needed!! This was my second time to Butlins Skegness, and standards have drop a lot. From we (party of 7) stepped into our room (Gold package) problems began. First the lights would not turn on then the TV's in both rooms would not get a signal. Then we noticed the sofa's, that looked like they were more than ready for the skip!!! Fortunately all these problems were solve within a hour of us complaining, which was good. However later that day we wanted to make a cup of tea , only to find the inside of the kettle was filthy and cover with limescale!!  This problem however was not solve until the next day, which was very annoying as we had a infant with us who needed bottles made up. So we had to resort in boiling water on the stove.  The next problem which I faced with the room was an extremely LOUD boiler. Which woke me up two nights in a row. In hindsight I should have complained quicker as it was dealt with very quickly by 'Tom' one of the managers.   After having problems with the room, I had the misfortune of being rudely treated and spoke to by a member of staff called 'PETER' (tall bald headed and wore glasses). This was in the 'Deck restaurant' which was part of the premium dinning pack offer. He was so rude and unhelpful that me along with the other 3 adults in my party felt uncomfortable and uneasy about going back to eat at that restaurant!  Apart from those problems the stay was enjoyable. However me having to complain so much was very off putting, and 'Peter's' rudeness was something I NEVER want to experience again.  The good points of the stay was great fun for children under the age of 5, great swimming facilities, and the night time entertainment (for adults) was watchable but could do with improvement! 
-2;" After reading the reviews I thought I had chosen well for £179.00. However, we were given what must have been the smallest room, right at the back of the hotel overlooking piles of paving slaps. We were met at reception by a new receptionist who had little idea of even basic knowledge of the hotel, not her fault I admit but perhaps she needed a little more training before being left on her own. It had been my husband's 50th birthday and I had asked if they could take that into consideration but there was no reference to this special occasion at all. The room was compact, even by London's standards with furniture that was a worn (not what appears on the website), marks on the carpet, no mirror in the actually bedroom and no accessible socket points. On the plus side the bedding was lovely and clean and the bathroom was clean and modern, although there was a faint smell of urine but I do have a very acute sense of smell.  As we were only staying one night we kept our disappointment to ourselves but will definitely not be returning. The final negative point was that after finding the breakfast room (no one had identified this for us on booking in), we were immediately reminded quite curtly that we were continental breakfast only.... Just one more tip; it's not really that close to the Albert Hall, probably about a mile out and quite a distance if you are in your finery and heels! "
-2; Overall it was great value for money as the rooms were very stylish and contemporary with extra large beds. The friendliness and personality of the day time staff was perfect and they were very attentive to our needs and went the extra mile for us. However the security and night time staff were not very flexible and rude. They didn't make us feel at ease and we were left feeling very uncomfortable. I mean this apartment is very central but quiet and yet close by to every necessity, night clubs and pubs, shops, restaurants, places to visit. But it was a shame that the night time staff were so rude to us and for this reason we will not be returning.  Lastly, the breakfast was pretty disappointing and if I would have known that it was just a few pastries and a coffee machine I wouldn't have asked for it to be included in the price. 
-2; I would support all the poor reviews for this hotel. It is an embarrassment to the Hilton name.  Cons: Dirty…… really old and dirty (cobwebs, hair, poor cleaning, stains, mould etc. etc.) Our room was so poor that it still had the old three pin round plugs so impossible to charge phone near bed…. Not to mention the safety. My four year old son turned on the hairdryer and the burning smell that came from it was worrying.  There was no soap to wash hands in the bathroom There was no plug in the sink in the bathroom (and one didn't appear when I asked for one) The bar prices were outrageous (over five pounds for the world’s smallest sherry) Our room looked like it used to be part of an old people’s home. There was an emergency pull cord above the bed (no joke) and a panel next to the bed with all sorts of ‘hospital’ type buttons. The duvet cover was ripped   Pros: It was cheap, relatively quiet and near legoland. The staff were nice – and just looked overworked and embarrassed – even the woman behind reception who directed us to the lift for a room on the ground floor (the same level as reception). Free milk from behind the bar for my son (even though they only had 0% fat milk)   NEVER EVER AGAIN. I will stay in a Premier Inn/ Travel lodge. 
-2;I'm no hotel snob but I think £108 for one night is extremely steep for this hotel. Firstly, the rooms are extremely outdated! This isn't a major issue as we were only staying here to watch a concert close by and therefore only needed a clean room to sleep in, but I have stayed in much nicer hotels for a lot cheaper! Our room (245) had several cracks in the walls which could do with repainting, marks on the carpet, cracked tiles in the bathroom and there was a hair left in the bath (clearly hasn't been attended to very well). Also we had no view whatsoever, as outside of our window was the top of another part of the hotel, we did have a good view of a conference room though The bed was extremely uncomfortable, we had such a bad nights sleep and the pillows and rock hard! Honestly, my advice would be to pay a little more money and stay elsewhere. Just not up to scratch (we won't be staying here again).
-2;" We visited this hotel for a bite to eat after taking a lovely walk around Daventry Country Park. Arrived at 4pm and bought our drinks at the bar (barman very polite and friendly) & were advised that it is table service and to wait for someone to take our order. We waited & waited & waited... all while waiters & waitresses walked past us. I might add that it was NOT busy. There was another couple opposite us and noticed that they had to stop a member of staff who appeared to be a manager (chap with shirt, tie & a tea towel hanging out of his pocket!) to take their order. Hoping that he would notice us with our menus on the table, sadly he did not. 30 minutes after sitting at our table I got fed up and asked fore mentioned chap to take our order. He did and apologized for not noticing us even though he walked past us numerous times. We ordered a cowboy burger & smothered piri piri chicken. Time now 5.05pm and still no food & the tea towel chap came over to our table and asked had we had our food yet?? Well the empty table with untouched cutlery was a pretty big clue! We said no and he said it will come out shortly. It did and when it came out the burger was burnt and had very few chips on the plate, & my plate was piled high with chips (bizarre). We were so hungry at this point we could of eaten the fixtures and fittings.  I was waiting on someone to stop to ask the obligatory &quot;Is everything ok with your meal?&quot; but as waiters, waitresses and tea towel chap passed us no one asked. We were not tucked away as we were the closest table to the bar. We did overhear other patrons making complaints as they paid for their meal. Obviously we were not the only ones having an unpleasant experience.  After we ate what we could we got up and paid for the bill. Tea towel chap took some money off the bill because we said our food was average. I used to be a waitress and our golden rule was always to ask the customer 5 minutes after setting the meal down &quot;Is everything ok?&quot; Don't think we will be back. Sorry "
-2; In no part of the hotels description was there evidence that there are no lifts - fine if the hotel is on the level - but this one is definitely not! My partner, a seasoned traveler, is unable to walk distances and especially not up and down flights of stairs. We have not previously experienced anything quite like this. There are stairs to the front entrance from the car park (although there is a narrow ramp to drive down and you are in danger of running down the smokers assembled outside the front door). Our experience here was dreadful. The first room we were shown to was occupied already - after quite a long trek from reception - probably 6 or 7 sets of stairs and through several sets of doors (with luggage!) We tried another equally far away in the opposite direction but again up several flights of stairs. Our third room (now having almost lost the will to live....) was small, dingy, (the bathroom had no window or extractor) and overlooked the dustbin and rubbish collection areas. This was a fairly busy area, we found! Usually we could get a couple of hours sleep in a row but that was about all. Staff cheerily greeted each other from about 5.30 in the morning. The room was never serviced throughout our stay, the bed was uncomfortable to say the least and the duvet was a hard, polyester version with pillows even harder. The curtains were filthy and the paint peeling off the walls in places. There were a few other points hardly worth mentioning after this lot. We were told there were no other rooms. After having experienced the room we finally had we came to the conclusion that it should not have been let as a guest room at all. No this was not the relaxing stay we had hoped and in fact had had quite enough after two days and checked out. We did get a slight reduction which really was pitiful in the circumstances. Never again! Reception staff and management were aware of our problems and NEVER once did the manager make any attempt to appear or try to talk with us. 4 stars??? no way!  We would however,have to say that there were two staff members in the breakfast/dinner/bar areas who were particularly good and tried very hard to ensure that at least in their areas we were made to feel welcome and as if the hotel wanted guests! They were Sue and Karina. Well done girls - perhaps you should take over from the management! 
-2; staff were not helpful at all me and my friend are disabled and we had to take our own luggage to our room the room was a single room we asked for double then we were told to go to reception so had to take luggage back downstairs got another room and still no porter to help 
-2; 3rd floor room so small could barely move around the small double bed. Whole place is cramped. There was sufficient coffee and tea for a single person. My room was above a function room and noisy until the small hours of the morning which might be why there were ear plugs made available,  Getting to the room was not easy for a person with mobility problems as it involved navigate lifts between one part of the building to the other and going up and down stairs although there was a disabled lift al in all it took 3 different lifts to get to my room. As an older single woman it took me 2 trips to carry my case and a bag of shopping between my car in the garage and my room on the 3rd floor.  Breakfast was poor the table was partially set, no teaspoon to stir coffee, no side plates for the toast.  Staff were pleasant but reserved and the room was spotless well done to the staff. 
-2; Four of us visited at the end of March 2016 on a SAGA short break. The initial paperwork was very misleading to the extent that even the hotel staff could not understand it. The wording of the free lunch aspect did not make clear that you only get a free lunch on the full day in the hotel. So if you arrive early or leave late expect to buy your lunch, ok if you plan for it. This may be SAGAs fault but there is no reason to mislead people. Our standard room overlooking the car park was quiet and fairly large but the maid service did not include removing the mould in the windows or replenishing the coffee making facilities. Not show stoppers! Be prepared to walk a long, confusing way to dine as the dining room is not clearly sign posted and if you have limited mobility you could end up using two lifts. The main reason for a low score is the awful dining arrangements. The Sherwood dining area has much in common with a motorway service area. No table cloths on the small, crowded tables and unless you are lucky enough get a table in the quiet side rooms it is very noisy. They only have two water jugs so think ahead if you want more than one glass of water as they can't leave a jug. The food is sub standard and the majority is self service. I have seldom seen such tired and limp salad and some dishes had clearly been prepared hours in advance. Most meat was overcooked and dry with side dishes that were grim. To be expected if you operate a cram em in policy! We did not pay the extra £20 for the other dining room as it appears to be nothing more than a grill. We used some of the outdoor facilities such as the putting green and bowls rinks but the latter was poorly maintained, uncoordinated and dirty. The staff were, on the whole friendly and helpful but run off their feet. The Cellar man in the Sherwood room was efficient and helpful when we had a bad bottle of wine, the opposite from the man in the cafeteria where you have your SAGA lunch. On being shown a long blonde hair in the soup he grudgingly changed it rather than offer an alternative. There may be health and safety aspects to this approach! The entertainment was ok but the system of booking seats needs looking at as many booked ones remained unused. Not rocket science. In summary the hotel suffers from poor management and an almost total lack of quality control. This end product is dirty rooms and harried staff and poor food. It is a shame because the hotel has potential but currently looks a bit like a house with so many extensions that the original has been lost in the process. We won't use SAGA and Warner again in a hurry. This NOT a fine dining hotel. 
-2;" This place is hard to find. Our sat nav took us past the entrance, the only sign being a small, wonky brown one on the opposite side of the road (apparently they can't put a sign on their entrance wall because it's historic). This error added half an hour extra to our journey as we inched our way around the labyrinth of streets, wrongly taking a right turn for which we'll probably receive a fine. It's clearly a common problem: one of the staff joked that about half of their guests manage to find it first time! If only Malmaison had made it clear on their website that you turn right down a small alleyway next to the Slug and Lettuce they'd have saved us time, stress and money.  We checked in at 2:45 and were told the room would be ready &quot;in ten minutes&quot;. Fifteen minutes later we were still waiting, and when my husband enquired the receptionist said it would be &quot;a few more minutes&quot; and gave us tokens for a cocktail at the bar. The gesture was appreciated but what we really wanted was for our room to be ready on time. We were finally given the key at 3:30. Moreover we were surprised to find ourselves having to chase this up with reception - at over £250 for the room we expected a better standard of service than this.  The building itself is stunningly beautiful and unusual. We stayed in the basement in a room which was attractively decorated but I agree with other reviewers that it was simply too dark, and the mattress was on the hard side of firm. The shower was rather feeble. I didn't appreciate the wine and nibbles for sale on display by the bathroom - who wants a tuck shop in their bedroom? It seemed in keeping with the conspicuously money-making approach of the hotel along with being offered to pay for an upgrade, pay for a cooked breakfast and their £28.50 fee for a night of parking on their own grounds.  Breakfast was delicious and the service then was fine. Overall the staff we encountered there were helpful. The hotel is situated in a great part of the city and it was an experience to stay in an old prison cell. But unfortunately our overriding impression was one of disappointment triggered by our poor experience of checking in after a rubbish end to the journey there. The stay there wasn't value for money and we wouldn't return. "
-2; We arrived at the hotel to check in and was met by a young lady who tried to tell us we had booked the wrong night of our stay and would have to pay a further £85! She didn't even look at our booking form. She was most rude and not very pleasant at all. Anyway we got taken to the airport by a very friendly gentleman. On return to the UK the taxi was waiting for us we got in but I had to ring the hotel to confirm that we had been picked. It was early in the morning but the driver was not very friendly. We then had to pick 6 other people from the south terminal. This was an 8 seater but we now had 10 to take back so the two ladies had their young children on their lap!? We arrived at hotel around 1.15am very tired and the young man behind the desk couldn't find our reservation but he was most apologetic and told us not to worry as they did have a room. It was on the 3rd floor with no lifts and our cases were very heavy I left mine at reception. The room was big enough for 4 but it was way to hot and really had trouble sleeping. Breakfast was good but I really wouldn't stay here again. 
-2;Was expecting a first class service for the price we were asked to pay, didn't achieve it, faulty towers sprang to mind. Booked breakfast for 7 am finally arrived 7.25, not very hot. Nowhere in room to sit and eat, very disappointed.
-2; My brother booked 2 rooms online and told me before we arrived that he had read mixed reviews on here but decided to book anyway. Both of the twin rooms we booked seemed to have different problems. The main light in my room didn't work which we later discovered was due to there not being any bulbs in them, the door stop had come off at some point and was laying several inches away from the door with the screw sticking out, the tap in the bathroom was leaking quite badly and for some inexplicable reason the curtains weren't long enough to cover the window. We also noted that the carpets were dirty and obviously had not been hoovered properly in quite some time. Also, the toilet roll holder meant the loo roll was about 6 inches off the ground. Very difficult for my 70 year old mother to be able to reach. None of the lights in her room worked at all. Fortunately she went to bed before it was dark and it was light when she got up. We didn't notice any of this when we first checked in or I would have mentioned something sooner, my mother requested that I didn't make a fuss. After a long day, all we wanted to do was get something to eat and get to bed. We used the restaurant on site and were unimpressed by the staff - they appeared friendly enough but seemed to lack motivation and in some cases basic knowledge about what was available to guests. Another party seemed to have several unruly children who ran around the dining room, played with cutlery on other tables and crawled around on the floor. I also witnessed 2 different staff nearly loose their footing when a child dashed in front of them. At no point did a member of staff approach the guests to ask them to protect their children from harm even if they did not wish to protect the rest of their guests from the noise they created. We left earlier than we otherwise would because of this and if it wasn't for our honesty we would not have had to pay for drinks as there was no system of keeping track of what we had eaten/drunk - no table numbers, as it was a carvery and we just helped ourselves to up to 3 courses we could also have lied about this too. Mum retired to her room to use the shower, which she said had no working temperature controls, it was either water on or water off. Fortunately she wanted a cool shower! Shortly after we had left and gone to bed the fire alarm sounded and we all filed outside. One guest was being particularly fowl and abusing a staff member, blaming her personally for ruining her weekend. This was the only member of staff I saw all weekend who was professional and presented the place in a good light, she remained calm and provided the woman with the details of who to complain to and then went about trying to ensure we were all safe. In the morning we saw many of the waiting staff who had been on the previous evening in the restaurant working the breakfast shift, looking tired and even less enthusiastic than the evening before. This was another self service meal so I was surprised to see so many of them there, standing around in groups chatting about things that my mother told me not to discuss in public. One member of staff, who I can only assume was the supervisor, challenged them about their behaviour but it appeared none of them took him seriously and they just carried on with their gossiping. I really was pleased to take my bags and leave. 
-2; On arrival, staff were rude, snappy and unaccommodating. Seemingly, they wanted to rush check in and be as unhelpful as possible in order to go home early. Rooms are dusty and not too great. Waste of money f you ask me.  Building is not actually in shoreditch, but in a ghetto looking area.  Refurbishments are currently taking place, probably what causes thendust, but they should make this known at the point of booking (they dont) 
-2; We stay here every June and July for birthday celebrations. We are 3 adults occupying 2 rooms with sea views. Wonderful views. Housekeeping good.   We arrived on Saturday 11th June 2016. Room not ready until 3pm ok. Reception not particularly pleasant.  Well. Half the hotel out of bounds a wedding on.!We have visited when a wedding on.BUT!this was a wedding from hell! Just take over as if they have a divine right to whole place.  Not to be deterred we made our way to the beach bar/terrace. Loud music louder guests and unruly children AWFUL. Wedding.   We ordered at the bar champagne real and real price. It was plonked on the table for us to open.No service too busy with wedding guests. We had 3 bottles and snacks and a friendly face appeared Cat or Caterina. Wonderful service then on.  To my amazement I saw on display a huge board advertising wedding package. £3.999 for 50 guests.Not professional.  We did not have dinner as menu awful   Lounge area had been divided in half boarded up! Wedding guests other side foul language singing chanting. Football on.  I went to reception on 3 occasions no one at desk had to shout Hello!  Noise outside went on until 12 am.  Breakfast in room excellent and good quality.   This hotel has to decide what they want and can cope with. If it's cheap weddings you can't have good paying guests as well.who are treated dreadfully and no service.   Not impressed. 
-2; Although the some of the rooms have been refurbished to a lovely standard the beds are the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in which completely ruined my stay. The noise level was pretty bad too!  The manager was very understanding as she knew about the issue of the beds and changed our room, however the beds were just as bad!! She said she would give us some compensation but never did. 
-2;" We spent a birthday weekend here in Feb 2014 - and wish that we had read trip advisor prior to coming. Our room was large enough and adequate but overlooked the car park at the rear - possibly our own fault for not paying extra for the seaview rooms. We had a deal (secret escapes?) where the first nights evening meal was included - what a let down, the poor waitress seemed to be embarassed at what she served up. We did ask if there was an la carte menu available but this fell on deaf ears. Breakfast was a buffet offering not to my husbands liking - he expects to be served at that price of accommodation. There is a small pool and &quot;lesiure&quot; facilty on offer - but I felt a bit self concious walking through the dining room corridors and seating area to get there in a dressing gown. Both inside and outside of the hotel look tired and in dire need of a drastic makeover. Limited parking if your'e not there early. Many years ago this hotel had a good reputation - sadly its let that go. We had a bar snack and chips on our second day - I sent the chips back as they were hard and undercooked - the chef sent a message back that that was the way he always cooked them. Ok - wont be back! "
-2; Visited the white hart hotel for a birthday weekend after booking a deluxe room. The room was at best standard and comparable with any low budget hotel in the area. When speaking to the receptionist she confirmed that we were in fact in what they called a deluxe room. We asked for the manager who again confirmed it was and that what we had paid £150 for one night was harrogate prices!!!! We were still not happy so he knocked off the price of the breakfast which was tasteless and parking costs which was also a con as this was a hotel car park. All in all a poor experience and will not visit again be warned as what you get is not the de lux picture on the website !!! 
-2; I had been to West Lodge Park hotel for dinner a few times and have always had a good experience so when I booked for afternoon tea on a Sunday for 4 of my friends I had high hopes. However I was bitterly disappointed. Once we were seated it took 15 mins for someone to come over and take our order. It then took a further 50 mins to be finally served our sandwiches and cakes, I can't imagine it takes this long to slap a few sandwiches on a plate.  Not once did anyone ask it everything was ok and we had to go to the bar to ask for everything such as the tea, the bill and to find someone for us to pay was also an ordeal.   I will not return here again due to this poor service as we did not once receive an apology, despite us saying we were not happy with the service. 
-2; Stated here 25/ 26th March for my birthday and was competing at a sports event. Friday night was quite noisy but did think it was Friday. However Saturday was ridiculous. There was a party going on in the venue at the back of the hotel. It went on till 2 and then for another hour in the car park. Then the staff decided to clear up tipping crate after grate of bottles into a large bin keeping us awake until 3.30ish. We decided to not have linger so checked out at 7ish so as not to waste the rest of the Bank Holiday. When we checked out I told the receptionist she said I`ll pass it on but there was a wedding party on. I said even though it was loud she asked me my room number and then said you were really high up you shouldn`t have been disturbed and then carried on talking to her colleague about how they lost an hours sleep!!!!!! I waited two weeks and was not contacted. I emailed the Hotel and related all my complaints and they have not even bothered to reply. Such a same as I really liked King` Lynn and enjoyed a beautiful meal at Bistro 22 which would make me want to re-visit however if you want enjoy this town I`d stay elsewhere. 
-2; Was looking forward to staying here but was very disappointed. Not the quality you would expect from a small 4 star hotel. Stayed in an Eclectic room but didn't think it had anything over a standard chain hotel (except for a roll top bath in the room that faces a window with no blinds, is built up making it dangerous to get out of and has nowhere near to hang your towel, so they should have left it in the bathroom). Rubbish TV, the most basic tea tray and toiletries, extremely warm room and noisy. House keeping let themselves into our room twice at 8.30, they started hovering the corridor at 9.15 and when we went to use the gym it was full of furniture. Management said we should have put the 'do not disturb' sign on the door, which I would have if there would have been one! The shower was fabulous though. 
-2; I won't be rushing back to this hotel. I stayed last week on business. First, the location - terrible. No restaurants nearby unless you want takeaway kebabs. Second, the room - the only radiator was in a bay window that was covered by floor to ceiling curtains - so you can either have heat or block light from the room. Both mornings the shower in turns scalded me and froze me, I'm assuming because a guest in another room flushed the toilet. Not impressed. Third, the attitude of the woman behind the desk when my room key stopped working. So sorry to have inconvenienced you with asking for help. I made the mistake of thinking that was your job and it was a routine thing to happen - less than 2 minutes to fix. But it was clear from your sour-faced expression and surly responses that customer service was a thorn in your side.  There must be better hotels in Sheffield and next time I need to travel there I will stay in one. 
-2; The hotel is in an excellent position in the centre and once we worked out how to access the place the car was taken care of by the staff. The staff are really helpful and concerned but the room was tiny and shabby. We were kept awake by loud music from the pub next door however this was nothing compared to the noise from the next door room. Not really the fault of the occupants but more the fact that there is clearly zero sound proofing between walls. 
-2; Stayed for the FA Cup Final. 10 people in our group. Had Junior Suite, which was very small, could hardly squeeze by the end of the bed as it was very close to the wall. The bathroom was very small. Had to close door in order to open shower screen above bath to enter the bath. Old tired shower.  Generally very poor for price paid. cannot find any reason to stay here again. 
-2; Arrived with a girlfriend for 2 nights in February. No hot water for a shower on first morning. I put it down to water pressure we were on the 4th floor. I mentioned it to reception, they apologised. !!!! No marmalade on breakfast table. Hoteliers must realise British people like marmalade for breakfast. !!!! Second morning, not only was there no hot water but no water at all. Still no marmalade at breakfast, nor yoghurt. They did however have soya milk on request. They were so embarrased by the whole debacle they offered us afternoon tea. Not all doom and gloom. Position of hotel perfect, just opposite Lancaster Gate tube station and bus stop just outside hotel . 390 bus goes to Oxford/Regent St., 
-2; We were placed in a room on the ground floor and had to ask to change rooms because of the noise. Every time the person in the room above us moved, loud creaks and squeaks reverberated around our room. As if a herd of elephants were doing the foxtrot up there. It was most annoying. But that was just the beginning. The worst part was no hot water. Tepid, at best. For the price of our room for the one night, I certainly expected more from a hotel that touts itself as luxurious. 
-2; Limited choice travelling on business and it's cost A LOT per night. No breakfast included , had to ask for free wifi and the room is small, dated and frankly looks like a travelodge room. I think I'd have preferred to stay in a travelodge and saved a fortune. I can even see the slats in the bed base because the mattress doesn't fit. Hilton ?? Nope 
-2; We have stayed at Seckford Hall several times before, a beautiful place. Stopped off last Friday for a meal at the bar, expecting the usual standard. The menu had changed to a plastic card with the sort of food we would never have stopped for, had we known. A white sliced loaf sandwich, already curling at the edges, a filling so thin and mean you could barely see it, a few limp leaves and a few cheap crisps. And for this and the other (equally thin) beef sandwich, we paid nearly seven pounds each. And apparently the menu for lunch was the same as in the restaurant in the evening. Surely not! The accommodation and common areas still looked excellent, but the restaurant and food are in steep decline. What a shame. 
-2; We booked through booking.com a suite - checked in at 3.20 (earliest check in was 3) - two nights. When getting to our room saw we had been given disabled room. This was distressing to us as we had booked weekend away as a break from caring for my terminally ill mother in law and this meant we were just reminded of this. We contacted reception and was told that we had booked this room. We categorically did not book a disabled room and despite arguing this fact was told we did and that everyone else had checked in and they couldn't change this. We did eventually manage to speak to a Manager who changed our room but not without us making a fuss. Apparently they do not clean rooms at weekends unless you request this - we did but it was not done and breakfast a shambles - no cups or glasses or cutlery - continually having to ask! Will not be coming back. 
-2; Booked afternoon tea here as I expected it to be something special with it being the Hilton. Took my god-daughter and best friend - book 2 x gluten free afternoon teas (liked the sound of the eton mess) And 1 childs afternoon tea. Got there around 1.10pm was 10 mins late as roadworks surrounding the Hilton - by 1.15 we had placed our drinks orders. It got to 1.45 we still had no drinks let alone food - my 3 year old god daughter was very agitated nothing keeping her occupied (baring in mind we were the only ones there why was there a wait?) Eventually food and drinks came - very bog standard. I asked for a plain scone it cam and had fruit in - no clotted cream or jam had to ask for this ? (bit strange). Also no eton mess just a pot of natural fat free yogurt .. why on earth I would want something fat free whilst having afternoon tea baffled me! The only good point of the experience was the childs afternoon tea really wowed my goddaughter. Top things off £6 to park (disgrace for an hour and a half). Wont return was not what it said it was! 
-2; The hotel was in a great location for us to go to the Albert Hall and when we arrived found it to be a beautiful building and the receptionist staff were helpful but when we went to our room how disappointed we were. We were in the basement and the room was so small there was no room for our suitcase and when we took a shower you could not turn around and if you were a size 8 you may be able to shut the door you had to hold shower gel on your hand as no way to place it. We complained to the staff who tried to help and it was obvious they were used to this complaint. No free Wifi and the price was too expensive and the price of breakfast was expensive. 
-2; The purpose of our trip was for me to relax after a really difficult work time. We booked through a site where it appeared we got our rooms for half price but this was still £150 a night so our expectations were high. So Rowhill Grange has got nice but small rooms, a really nice swimming pool area, some great treatments on offer and a nice restaurant. However it is all eye wateringly expensive. And the honest truth is, and i don't mean this unfairly, we have stayed in some much nicer, bigger places with better spa treatments for much less. I nearly couldn't have any treatments at all as when we phoned a fair while before to book treatments someone on reception told us I could just leave it til I arrived. A lovely lady in the spa bent over backwards to fit in what I wanted when I spoke to her even though it wasn't her fault at all and couldn't believe I had been told that. The people who work in the spa are charming and well trained.   However, we did not appreciate it when on check out, the receptionist looked at our bill and told us that we should have taken advantage of one of their special offers and we would have paid far less. This is not helpful when departimg with a lot of money and rather bad manners. So I left feeling a little stressed that we had not had a good deal. 
-2; With one hours free wifi in public areas, an additional £18 parking fee, no bottled water let alone a mini bar in the room, only sparkling water at breakfast with only white bread accompanied with a wait for beans, bacon and poor quality sausages, no lounge or extra facilities, a roof/ wall view, a double bed in a room that had basic furniture and all for £240 for one night. York is stunning as is the hotels location, however if you are looking for luxury this is not the hotel for you. 
-2; First night air conditioning unit was turned off but made loud noises all night, pillows were hard. We was moved to another room as the air con unit was in need of repair, in this room the extractor fan in bathroom wasn't working at all, the hairdryer didn't work although there was another in the wardrobe and the room was darker it only had one small window.  The fish we were served was off it tasted and smelt odd, we sent it back and even the waiter said it smelt off, they were very sorry and offered us another meal but didn't want to eat there again. Wasn't impressed with the beakfast the cereal selection was poor not enough fresh fruit, standard supermarket bread, no rolls or crusty bread. Surprised that it has a four star rating. 
-2; Visited for a birthday meal and was very disappointed. The food was bland and didn't have much flavour, staff were disinterested and spent most of their time chatting amongst themselves at the bar. Watched the staff playing with their hair and then making people's drinks, nothing was amazing just all very mediocre. I expected better 
-2; stayed. as a group. newly decorated hotel in modern art deco style. nice surroundings. room. looked nice but stank of fag smoke. toilet. smelled of urine. and remote for tv didn't work. nor standard lamp light. We all had big bar meal order. starters were good. mains were appalling. staff became. confrontational at complaint even though some of the party were regular patrons. breakfast ok, could have been warmer and needed fresh eggs. tea quality poor. rooms had only 2 teabags but 4 milk which was stingy. heard it was a place of good reputation but not our experience. For those in a hurry there is a heli port based in the grounds. 
-2;Attended venue for meal and function. Whilst what food we had was nice one bowl of vegetables between 10 was unacceptable as was the 2 hours it took to serve 3 courses. Waiting staff had to be told what to do and most seemed very inexperienced. Very old fashioned, curtains faded and dirty, carpet needs replacing and toilets were like school toilets. They weren't the cleanest, no niceties other than cheap liqujd soap and decor was very outdated. Considering this is a 4 star hotel, very very disappointing.
-2; Booked afternoon tea on living social. We were in a party of16 which we were told wouldn't be a problem and we were sat all together in a room of the restaurant which was fine as we were all together. When the waitress came to give the pro secco out she managed to give three glasses the rest went down the back of my husband!! She was apologetic but when I asked if they had a spare shirt for him to wear was told no and there were no laundry facilities available either for it to be dried. After she gave the wine out she brought the afternoon teas which were very disappointing. The tea and coffee were cold (this was replaced as soon as she could). Then we were asked does anyone want a sharp knife to cut the scone! I might have known they would be hard. It took about 15 mins to bring 8 teas out why didn't they give her any help? We did notice that someone else in the restaurant had a drink spilt on them as well. We did get a free bottle of pro secco for the spilt drinks. I would not recommend this hotel for afternoo tea to anyone and the photos on living social site are nothing like what you actually get. The only positive thing is you have a lovely view of the river. 
-2;" Stayed here with friends for one night, but I don't think I'd visit anytime sooner.. First of all the bad points...ever since the Hilton was taken over the hotel management seem to hold the budget back more and more. The exterior of the building needs modernising, as it doesn't stand out as vintage or retro at all; unlike the other competitor hotels nearby; Midland and Victoria although the interior is not as bad.  The rooms aren't as elegant as they seem in person; they're better on pictures, however you do get the usual amenities thrown in. There is an array of food choices unlike other hotels, but I suggest you stay away from the pizza on the night menu!! It's small and tasteless, and it looks like its been bought from the supermarket for a pound! Finally to sum up the whole experience, the good points of this hotel which makes them stand out are the staff; they are very friendly and they look after you aswell. I wouldn't be heading back soon, but I do wish they renovate the place soon to balance the service they provide for their guests. "
-2; I had booked a one night getaway stay package for my 21st birthday with five friends, so was supposed to be a real treat for all of us but was not impressed with our stay.  We arrived at 10.15am Saturday morning and didn't manage to check in until gone 11am, but our rooms wouldn't be ready until 3pm but we were told we would be made first priority, so we had to leave our luggage with the concierge until then.   The service was so slow and there were only two receptionists working so there was a massive queue. We all had treatments at 11am which meant we were late for our treatments and we weren't even directed to the spa as we had no idea where we were going, so it didn't make a relaxing start to the day and missed out 10 minutes of treatment time.   We were all very pleased with our treatments and the therapists were very friendly, as a therapist myself I was impressed with the treatments. The spa itself is very small considering the size of the hotel, it’s a shame there is no relaxation room and only two loungers by the poolside to use. There were children splashing and running about and making noise which wasn’t particularly relaxing.   So we then returned to reception later that day at 3pm after queuing for another 45 minutes, we were told our rooms were still not ready and they couldn’t tell us when we would even be able to get into our rooms! So we then returned another 2 times after even more queuing, we eventually got into our rooms at 6.45pm!  After rushing to get ready for dinner which was supposedly booked in the Oscars restaurant at 8pm, they then turned round and said that there wasn’t a table booked for us. However we did manage to get a table but if it had been busy we would of had to wait which is not on after we had booked our table. The food in the restaurant was very nice, good value and very nicely presented.   The following morning we still had to check out of our rooms by 11am which was not acceptable as we didn’t even have our rooms the full amount of time the previous day, and yet again took another 45 minutes to check out. We then went and had breakfast which was fantastic, huge selection of foods to choose from!  Finally considering it was my 21st birthday the hotel had made no effort of making it at all special for me, which I was most annoyed about when my mother had even emailed the hotel to inform them and they had taken no notice of!   Overall I would not recommend the hotel, it’s a 4 star hotel with very poor service and overly expensive, you only turn 21 once and I wish I had chosen a different hotel! 
-2; We stayed here in May for a romantic weekend.  I thought it was worth paying a bit more for what I expected to be luxury accommodation. It was not. I travel a lot for work so am aware of prices and standards and unfortunately this was overpriced.  The room was very dated and basic and the bed dipped in the middle. Thankfully it was quiet even though we faced the main road.  The bathroom was outside across the hall and was very nice.   We ate in the restaurant and had squid for starter which was very bland. My fish pie however was excellent. But we were let down by the chocolate sponge which was devoid of any sugar or flavour and a creme brûlée which tasted of nothing.  The area however is beautiful so worth a visit! 
-2; I attended a 60th wedding anniversary. Too many, tightly packed tables prevented the waiting staff serving anyone sat on the outer edges (with their back to the wall) with wine (so quite a few guests didn't get any). I was seated by a very drafty exit  door (on to the patio area), asked for any other seat and was told all other seats we're taken. I was constantly bashed in the back by this exit door every time anyone came in or out.  A buffet followed but the food ran out very quickly. Clearly inadequate for a party they must have had numbers for before we arrived.  I asked the waiter if any more food would come and he said no. I then asked him if I  could order a meal at the bar as I didn't want to drink on an empty stomach. He appeared to be very cross with this request, said no and said that he felt insulted.  Not at all what I would expect from a hotel with this number of stars. I know how  much this party cost and frankly the service, lack of food, cramped conditions in the function room etc didn't match the price charged. 
-2;" Positives-friendly helpful staff and very inviting lobby! Good convenient location for tube and sights.  The hotel states &quot;The well-appointed Standard Rooms at one of the finest hotels in Kensington are comfortable and welcoming&quot;. I would dispute that on the three Standard rooms we saw. See attached photos of the long standing build up of filth on the window frames in one &quot;Standard Room&quot;....also filthy stained carpet, grease laden easy chair, heavy staining on all bathroom surfaces, marked and dirty towels, smelly ..etc etc.  Then see attached photo of a pillow in another similar room from which the pillow case was removed as it came with something distinctly unpleasant on it. Finally see photos of window frame in a Club Room.....an improvement of sorts! This would suggest to me that the hotel attitude appears that customers in Standard Rooms are not worth being presented with the cleanliness standards of the Club Rooms. Incidentally the Club Room was &quot;just&quot; passable.  Breakfast was adequate, but high turnover of customers meant staff were clearing tables before people had finished their meals. Witnessed this at table next to us. If you want that second piece of toast, keep your hand on your plate!  Surely a hotel that professes to call itself a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel should ensure that the &quot;basics&quot; of cleanliness is maintained throughout ALL ROOMS, rather than just in the more expensive ones. As you will have guessed we were after our first night's stay, eventually upgraded to a Club Room by the Manager for which we were grateful. However the reasons for that should NEVER have happened in the first place. I for one will not be recommending this hotel and would never consider staying there again, simply because of the &quot;standards ethos&quot; that appears to be applied. "
-2;Easy check in but ordering food a disaster. Requested no cheese on a burger, got cheese. Chips inedible. Service at the cafe was very poor, the waiter had to check several times to confirm the order and even then it was wrong. Room average. Bed fairly comfy but very, very basic.
-2; The hotel was nice, the staff were pleasant and the room was nice and roomy enough for myself, my husband and two young children.  That was my first impression, until my children went to sleep and were consistently woken by stags (of the human kind) shouting and singing in the corridors and at one point knocked our door!!! The children were settled again....cue the hysterical shouting, screaming, whooping from various people, until around 4:30 am!  Granted this hotel is central, however, the reservation was for a family and to put us on the same corridor as a stag do and on the side of the hotel which was quite clearly the noisiest was in my opinion very poor indeed!  I would not recommend this hotel as a good place to stay for a family, I would, however, recommend it to anyone who really enjoys disturbing other paying customers and waking children! 
-2; We had an incredibly disappointing 4 night stay here to attend a show at the NEC. Having booked back in March, when we arrived to check in we were told that there were no twin rooms available so we would have to have a queen bed room with a sofa bed. We have stayed in the Crowne Plaza for the past four years for the same show so we're very surprised and disappointed. We were told it was our fault as we should have booked earlier - apparently all the twin rooms were booked by the previous August. We had also called to add on an extra night and been told that the room type was confirmed. However, on check in it seemed that the extra night had been booked for the wrong date, a week after the night we wanted. All of these nights had been prepared so despite not getting what we had booked, we had to stay.  We went up to the room to find we had been given a room overlooking the building site of the Resorts World next to the hotel. Knowing that the air con in the hotel isn't brilliant and we'd need to sleep with the windows open, we asked to move rooms. We were then given a double room on the other side of the hotel, also with a view of the site and the hotels bins. This was a room set up for disabled access. The bathroom smelt very damp, found to be coming from the rotten bath panel, there were marks all over the furniture and wallpaper, and the wardrobe was tiny. The bed was fairly comfortable and the shower powerful although the bathroom had a lot of black mould in it. We could hear everything going on in the adjoining room and no doubt they could hear us too. The next morning we went to breakfast which was very busy. We were given a table that hadn't been properly laid up - there was no milk or sugar and it was difficult to get a member of staffs attention. Tea arrived eventually but the mug was cracked and very stained. All of the plates, tea pots, cutlery etc were covered in marks, and nothing looked very clean. I had to go through four plates on the buffet before finding one that was free from dried on egg and bits of food. They were able to get me some gluten free toast though and the food itself was quite good. The next day we were called to say that there was a twin room we could have. When we got back to the hotel after the show, we were told that they had moved everything to our new room. Except they hadn't - we had to have two further trips to get everything out of the safe, the bathroom etc.  The rest of the stay was fairly uneventful but went along much as expected - the beds are comfy, food was ok (but very expensive for what it us, particularly the buffet). The reservations manager agreed to refund the night booked for the wrong week in the end. Also, we were not charged for our car parking as a good will gesture. However, we will definitely not be staying here again - it charges a premium price for a very 2* experience. Massively disappointing, what a shame that it has gone so far downhill. 
-2; Stayed here on New Years Day and was let downfrom the minute we arrived. Room should have been ready at 3. We got our room at 6pm. Very slow reception service, very short staffed. No one really knew what was going on.  Spa area was a bit dated. Resturant was very slow service waited an hour for drinks (2 bottles of beer?!) It seemed short staffed the whole time we were there.  Massage was the only highlight.  Management seemed disinterested in complaints, some people compensated, we were not. At check out, no management to speak to. Has the potential to be good, just isn't at the moment.   
-2;" We stayed for a quick break to use an Afternoon Tea voucher. The Hotel is used I would say primarily for weddings as it is in very photogenic grounds, so weekend bookings in the summer are probably hard to get and best avoided. Closer attention could be paid to clearing up the &quot;wedding&quot; detritis both from around the main entrance and down by the lake. The food in the restaurant, in the main, was very good but one night we were served with a cold ratatouille vegetable side dish, rather than hot. We did query if this was meant to be cold or hot as it was still edible whichever way ( it should have been served hot). The afternoon tea was excellent. The room was very comfortable with flatscreen tv and Freeview channels. Hotel well placed for easy access to Staithes, Whitby and the NorthYork Moors. We would stay again. "
-2; We stayed at the Victoria from the 3rd march until the 6th, beautiful hotel very stylish and the staff were great very helpful. But we were so disappointed with the food most nights, we had invited our daughter and husband for dinner as it was a birthday celebration, my turbot was so dry I couldn't eat it and when the pancakes arrived we couldn't cut them as they had been reheated many times so they also had to go back , we were offered pancakes the next night but we declined as I fancied the poached pears what a disaster as they also couldn't be cut they were so hard.Both my husband and I have been to the Victoria a number of times and always enjoyed it BUT we have decided not to go again.June Wood 
-2; We booked a nigt at this hotel for our 20th wedding anniversary, and left feeling very dissapointed. The room was fine, a pool-side suite - so good to be able to get straight out to the pool - although the bathroom was definitely not 4 star standard and the bed extremely hard. On going to dinner we were turned away by a very rude maitre d' because my husband wasn't wearing a jacket - he had a dress shirt and tie and looked very smart, but didn't bring a jacket because it was so hot. There was no indication on booking that a jacket was necessary for dinner. In the hotel information in the room (i.e. too late for packing) there was a notice saying that a jacket was required, but this also indicated that the hotel could provide a jacket if necessary - but this was not offered when we turned up for dinner. Basically we were told to eat in the bar, which was completely empty, had no staff and no atmosphere. In the end we walked into town and had a meal at a different hotel.   Overall, the hotel was stuffy, the staff unhelpful and the whole place set up for an older customer - for example you can't use the pools or have breakfast before 8am, and my husband had to be back at work at 8.30. Basically don't go here if you want to live or laugh! 
-2;Was advertised as having WIFI which is not the case. The hotel only has access to the Cloud network which does not work. Very poor service, asked reception for conditioner... still waiting for a response!
-2; Not impressed overall with this Novotel. Check in staff were lovely but it went downhill from there. My room had been painted recently, but still smelled really badly of paint fumes which was really unpleasant.  The rooms are tired, not particularly clean, and there were loose nails and the bathroom door threshold was sticking up and very sharp.   Breakfast wasn't much better, cutlery and bowls not clean, and not a great selection. Cereal had clearly been sitting out for a good few days.  In terms of convenience, I flew into Terminal 5 and it was a good 20 minutes in a taxi to get here. 
-2; The room was very old and worn, furniture broken, cigarette burn in desk, light fittings sizzled, dust every where. Holes in bathroom wall. Walls paper thin, can hear everything (take ear plugs). I was staying for business but had I been staying for pleasure I would not have been at all happy with the cost of the rooms. I have been to much nicer travel lodges/premier inns! 
-2; I was delighted to be invited by some friends to visit Bowood hotel, at the start of August, I knew of the house and gardens, but was not familliar with the hotel, I arrived at the hotel, and was greeted by a friendly porter, and receptionist. I was shown to my room, which was delightful, a little on the small side, but decoated beautifuly. We had the afternoon to relax, and all met for dinner in the main restaurant that evening, the food was outstanding, the presentation was fautless, and the flavours some of the best I have ever tasted. The Breakfast followed the same pattern with great attention to detail, crispy bacon, and the perfect runny poached egg. I decided that I would treat some of my friends to this delightfulvenue, however was throughly dissapointed on my return visit. THe greeting was flawless as before, and the room this time was a much more generous size, however the food that evening after raving to my friends of the delectabelness was somewhat of a cruel let down. The flavours were lacking in interest, the food was practically 'slopped' onto the plate, I can honestly say I have never felt so embarrased in my life, my friend thought I had gone crazy. We decided not to say anyhting at dinner, but when breakfast the next morning was of a similar dizmal standard, I decided to ask a young waiter, if there had been any drastic happenings that had made my experience so different? I was informed that there was a new chef at the hotel, as the old one that had been there on my previous stay had left!! This was very clear to me, and based on this, I will not be in a hurry to rush back to Bowood for a meal! Very dissapointing, partcularly as my first experience had been so positive! 
-2; I expected a 5 star experience for the amount i paid. As a group of adults we could not have been more disappointed. The staff were unhelpful and unorganised.  We had asked for 3 rooms close to each other and were given one in a completely separate building of which they were reluctant to change and even then the changed room they gave us was the other side of the hotel.  We reached the bedrooms and found that they were Twin rooms instead of the Doubles we had asked for.  The rooms could have done with a bit of a touch up paint wise. The beds were too soft and uncomfortable with a dip in the middle.  The Spa changing rooms were closed so we were advised to go down to the spa in our dressing gowns and slippers but there was no slippers provided in two of the rooms. The pool was freezing and the single Jacuzzi was over crowded as was the steam room. The evening meals were very nice but they put extra charges on anything and everything. Cocktails were EXTREMELY overpriced. The breakfast buffet was empty and we had to wait for them to fill it up and when you went up again it was empty again!  i will not be recommending this hotel nor will i return 
-2; The hotel is right near Lancaster Gate tube. Facing a semi main road, there are buses going passed all the right. There is a bus stop right outside, this is fine for convenience however it's noisy.  Our hotel room was on the third floor facing the road and the noise is like you were next to the bus! The windows are big but single paned so it blocks nothing! Had to turn the tv on louder because the traffic outside drowned the tv!  The hotel decor is outdated and worn out. Room furnitures has chipped and ripped walls. There is a old muggy smell throughout the hotel.   Will not stay here again! Couldn't sleep and asked to change rooms but it was full! Lucky only stayed for one night, but had a marathon to run the next day! 
-2; The hotel had a great atmosphere and I have had a great stay. The rooms were clean, tidy and comfortable, however, way too pricy. I also paid for a continental breakfast which I didn't think had enough options to choose from, considering its price apart. In comparison to other hotels I have stayed I was shocked. It only had a few selections, from crossaints, two types of cheese, ham and turkey brest as well as some mini pain au chocolat and pain au raisin. I would strongly recommend to have breakfast elsewhere.  Moreover, the spa wasn't too impressive either. We paid £10 for two hours of use of the spa when the hotel would normally charge you £25 for a whole day, but within two hours, we were bored of its facilities and it was very noticeable that so were the other guests as they all left within an hour in there after having used the pool, sauna and the snow room.  Other than the spa and breakfast, it was a pleasant stay and staff were friendly and helpful. But definately not worth the price... Hope this helps anyone considering this hotel. 
-2; The hotel facilities were ok although the food in the restaurant was mediocre , the staff were pleasant enough. We were a party of five and had booked the rooms through booking.com months earlier. When we went to pay the bill we found that the price of the second night has risen - apparently because prices change according to the number of people staying. That did not sound right and when challenged the extra charge was taken off. The receptionist also charged £13.50 for breakfast rather than the price given by booking.com of £10.00 because we did not say the night before we wanted breakfast. The receptionist did not tell us this when we arrived. We ended up feeling a bit ripped off and I won't be staying there again. 
-2; Functional rooms, although we weren't provided with hand soap. Outdated fee structure, as an example, £15 to get wifi in your room for a day, complimentary wifi only on ground level, most B&B's/hostels have free wifi these days. Nothing flash, and does not live up to the Hilton brand. 
-2;" I arrived for a 3 night stay on Sun night I usually stay at a hotel in Acocks Green very clean hotel, exceptional food and attentive staff though a little dated and as I thought my customers might be staying at the same hotel thought I would try somewhere else. Mon morning breakfast at 7.30 plenty of variety and all fresh although only 1 teabag in the teapot so just needed an extra stir, Mon evening bed made bin emptied but trash left on my dressing table. Went for dinner ordered a pizza which may as well have been a margherita for the lack of toppings though the margherita was tasty. Tues morning breakfast at 7.30 but this time, food was not fresh, bacon hard as the road and the fried eggs were like rubber, the toast was nice but then i did make this myself this time the tea had 4 teabags in the one person pot, thankfully i went to stir straight away so i didn't get tar for tea. Tues night rubbish removed from the room but this time i noticed the bathroom had not been wiped down as i have 2 toothpaste stains on the edge of the basin. I went shopping and came back for dinner at 7.30. I was the only one in the bar ordered a &quot;glass&quot; of beer and was given a pint, sat down and perused the menu for 5 minutes to decide what to have. Another couple arrived, after they had been sat down for 5 minutes the bar man came to ask were they ready to order food, so I then had to call him to take mine as he hadn't noticed that the menu was still next to me 15 minutes after i had sat down. I ordered a Panini and a portion of skin on fries. The waiter brought my plate and then said he would be back with my fries but the Panini came with wedges that wasn't mentioned in the menu nor did the barman mention this when i ordered. The waiter then brings the fries minus the skin! then i noticed that my Panini is in fact a demi baguette and is missing the tomato and am therefore glad the barman gave me a pint instead of a glass as I was going to need it to wash this down. There was dry chicken in the Panini and some of the bacon looked suspiciously like the hard as the road bacon from breakfast this morning. As it's quiet the bar man decides to do some cleaning instead of the usual checking with the customer, &quot;is everything ok&quot;. He works his way around the room moving chairs and then cleaning the leather seats. I gave up when he then cleaned the chair at the front of my booth as eating and smelling furniture polish just doesn't do it for me. I will probably be staying clear of the cooked breakfast in the morning and keeping my fingers crossed that i can make my own toast and I'll double check the teabag content and lets just say next time even if the customers are wanting to stay at the same hotel we'll all be staying elsewhere. "
-2; This hotel should not be a Hilton as it lets the brand down badly. I have had to stay there due to business commitments and would not recommend it to anyone. On the occasions I have stayed I have encountered the following issues - blood on the towels (not mine), blood on the floor (not mine), poor lighting in the rooms, intermittent internet access, exceptionally draughty windows, mould on the shower curtain, painfully slow check in and check out due to lack of staff, slow restaurant service and lukewarm meals. This list is by no means exhaustive. When I took my issues to the duty manager, he wrote it all down, and he never contacted me again!! I hope to be able to avoid this hotel in the future! 
-2; Politeness of staff, cleanliness of the hotel, lovely shower, easy access when you stay out late, lovely bar area, but food is expensive (£10 for a sandwich with no accompaniment) as are the drinks (but they are very, very nice) and the location is great. The problem with this visit was that for £380 for two nights we couldn't even have a cup of tea, as the only milk was in the mini bar, we were in the outer building which was run down and the stairs were narrow, highly treacherous (we stayed in Villa Maria) and difficult with even small suitcases or over night bags. You cannot get two two people on the staircase at a time and it the corridors reminded me of university (old buildings at York). The tv shared area is small and exceptionally dark. Also for nearly £400 for two nights to not include breakfast or be able to take a bath (albeit a standard room) is a bit poor. This hotel is not value for money so I assume it's because of its location. 
-2;" I was so disappointed with my short stay at this hotel. I had to change my first room which was a double due to lack of a chest of drawers and an inadequate single space wardrobe. The cleaners also ingored my 'do not disturb notice' and knocked a second time on my door.  The next room was bigger but I had to stand on a chair to stop one of the sash windows so as to wedge a makeshift piece of cardboard in to stop the incessant banging all night; the cardboard fell out eventully and I just had to put up with the clatter. The bed in this second room was not made up properly with the duty manager agreeing with me when I demonstrated the sloppily loppily placed undersheets which were simply left in a crumpled huddle and not tucked in and extremely uncomfortabe when lying on them. The bathroom was freezing, with a gusty cold wind blowing in; there were still no chests of drawers but it did have a double wardrobe, TV channels were unavailable with no maintenance available to rectify it.  This hotel is an old one and its Georgian heritage referred to on its web site but absolutley no information about its history in either of these rooms. I would not stay again and I venture to say that the Clarendon is resting on its historic laurels and letting it fall into decay. It is all well and grand to boast its Georgian architecture but this does not make it a comfortable place to stay in my opinion. The Hotel definatley needs important updating.  The good thing was the staff were apolegetic, friendly and helpful and complied with my request for a refund. What can helpful staff do when the hotel is not up to scratch.They can only work with what the hotel offers which in my opinion was second rate The owners need to pull their finger out and undertake the renovations necessary to make this hotel a place to be proud of. "
-2;" I arrived for a weekend with my Mum. Aunt and Sister and asked for adjoining rooms. &quot;No can do.&quot;   Except, when my Mum and Aunt got a room way down the corridor from ours they had an adjoining door. &quot;No matter, we can call you when we need you.&quot;   Except that, in spite of us complaining at least twice and them sending someone up, the phone in their room never worked. &quot;No matter, you won't need it.&quot;   Except when My Mum was rudely awakened from her sleep at 2am by a party in the adjoining room and she couldn't call downstairs to complain. She went out into the hall and it was much quieter than it was in their room. She woke my Aunt up by knocking on the adjoining door and asking them to be quiet, which they completely ignored. She didn't want to get dressed and go downstairs to complain so instead they both lay awake until the party stopped at 4.30am.   The whole place is beautiful - big rooms. artfully placed furniture - and the staff are friendly enough but it would be so much better if, instead of apologising all the time, they just fixed all the things that are worng with the place. So many little niggles - rooms are too dark, our twin room was made up as a double, the air conditioning was on cold (in January!) instead of heat, they did not replace our toiletries, the bar was painfully slow, not to mention the breakfast debacle with the epileptic waitress (hope she's okay) but the lack of sleep for two pensioners has sunk the whole ship for me. "
-2; Stayed 6th & 7th June 2014. One of a block booking of approx 10 rooms for wedding party. Our room was a double, quite small, window would not stay open, decor tired, evidence of mildew in bathroom, other party members had appalling experiences - no hot water for 1 couple, who had booked disabled room but it had been given to other party members when they arrived, other couple with disabled room had a huge tub chair in the ay of the wheelchair when they arrived, I could go on at great length but primarily most of the staff whilst very 'nice' did not speak English as first language which caused numerous difficulties. Suffice to say I would not seek arepeat experience. 
-2; Badly in need of refurb room smelt damp and the bathroom door did not close due to damp problems , lamp shade broken,cobwebs in corners,someones hair on the tea tray, and as for the corridor carpets stained and thread bear and some pieces patched up with black tape. Shame really as the staff all very nice. 
-2; I went there and found a disgusting fat bogey on the bed. Put me off for the whole day. Need I say more?   Breakfast was horrible. I was put off by watery pale omelette, thick sausages and the sight of bits floating about in the juice. The plain yoghurt and fruits smelled a bit off.  Jacuzzi had black mould growing around it. Floor was slippery.   Staff were shy. Or too busy to talk to you. (they were talking with each other)   Need vegetarian sausages for breakfast. Us vegetarians would love hot breakfast too. 
-2; Have been to the Queens Hotel in Cheltenham many times over the years ,and this weekend we stayed for two nights as we were celebrating a family wedding ( not in the Queens thankfully) . Having booked a Privilege room for space to get ready for the wedding , our room was indeed very large with a great bathroom . However , in the 'Privilege ' package you get a free paper , ours didn't arrive, bath robes which were essential this weekend as spending a lot of time getting ready for wedding dinner / actual wedding . Eventually two robes turned up after many times of asking . There were complimentary soft drinks. , no glasses. Breakfast was delicious with a great choice but tables laid without cups, teaspoons and had to ask for toast . The breakfast staff seemed very disorganised.  Next month the hotel Is rebranding as MGallery and it's obviously been very nicely refurb end where possible but a lot of staff training seems required , especially as the prices are extortionate for the standards provided.finally we were charged £12 per day for parking ,which after spending over £200 B&B was scandalous! 
-2; First night of our 3 night stay. Checked in afternoon and asked housekeeping to replenish box of tissues and change pillows . Bedtime this wasn't done!  The night receptionist has to act as bartender in the isolated bar and housekeeper as well as receptionist! Talk about cutbacks! Also restaurant served rock hard bread and  For dessert, pastry so hard that you could not cut it with a knife, let alone eat it. Service was slow too. Food portions terribly small!  Bitterly disappointed in day 1 of our stay! 
-2;" The building - very striking from the outside - was apparently the Victorian eye hospital. Ironic then that the entrance is very badly lit with awkward steps up to it and unexpected steps - treacherous because they're at different levels - inside. The Service desk is even more poorly lit with small print on the check-in form, making it difficult for both staff and clients to read. Check in took 10 minutes. Before our stay I had rung to ask about making a car park reservation. I was told &quot;It isn't a problem - just turn up&quot;. I wasn't informed that the car had to be valeted for £20 and therefore we couldn't access it during our stay, something I regard as inconvenient.  The Bubble Lounge was very noisy with music: I wanted to read but that was impossible. The Pub du Vin was also noisy and poorly lit but the staff there were courteous and helpful, taking drinks up the awkward staircase to us in the Reception area (also dimly lit) and pointing out that there was a Courtyard area which was better lit and relatively quiet (if cold). Throughout our stay there did not appear to be anyone in charge.  The signs inside the lift present problems for anyone who is visually impaired. The bedrooms all have pretentious names with dark doors, dark cupboards, dark carpets, dark windowframes, dark blinds and are so appallingly lit that it's impossible to read or see anything properly. The furniture is dark, angular and unattractive. The bed was comfortable but its frame jutted out which meant I banged my leg on it several times. Sachets of tea and cocoa were provided but, inexplicably, a &quot;Nespresso&quot; machine, without any instructions and which is not intuitive to operate, was the only source for coffee. The wifi is free and works.  I'm reasonably tall but the bath/shower is very deep to get in and out of, with no grab rails and nothing to hold on to except a slippery shower screen. I don't want or need plush bath robes which somebody else has worn. The lighting in the bathroom was acceptable.  The full English breakfast (at approximately £15) was passable though the black pudding was dry and the mushrooms dull but the Continental breakfast (at almost £13) was a disgrace compared with those I've had in other parts of Europe. Why doesn't the hotel give thought to the many customers, particularly those working, who perhaps just want some toast or a croissant and coffee at a reasonable price?  The lunch menu at the Bistro was passable; my former colleague had the early bird lunch which she claimed was &quot;all right&quot;. I've eaten better moules. We had an excellent Italian wine recommended by one of the staff in the Pub du Vin.  I was told that the hotel does have wheelchair/disability access from the Pub du Vin entrance via the lift but I do think the proprietors need to give serious thought to whether their lighting facilities in most of the hotel are in breach of the disability provisions of the 2010 Equality Act.  As far as I can discern the only justification for the high price of the accommodation is the hotel's location. "
-2; Stayed fir a friends wedding . The room was small with a very small bed . The bathroom wasn't very clean there was dirt behind bathroom door and something splattered up the mirror behind the door . Although the room was booked for two there was only one dressing gown . The bed was small and the linen tucked so tight you couldn't get in . I never slept at all . Breakfast was just about average if that with the bacon being in a fatty heap On the plate the half a mushroom was uncooked and I don't think the eggs even hit the frying pan . The quarter of a slice of bread was the offering for fried bread was so hard it couldn't be cut . 4 tiny round pieces of toasted baguette were the offering for toast for two . With a bill of £150 for one night plus breakfast was appalling . I certainly wouldn't stay here again . 
-2; on arrival 23/12/13 the silver bungalow was very nice spotless. the single beds are so uncomfortable to narrow. but the 1st night we had a flood i had to sit up til 2.30 AM for a man to look at it..next morning we were moved to a better bungalow. for dinner we went to the sun & moon very nice but very expensive. staff very friendly.also not everything was free, if you wanted to ice skate you had to book it to be told you could only use it once. you had to book a table in the other restaurants. the pool was freezing cold when its supposed to be a tropical temperature.my grandchildren were freeing within 20 mins its not as good or big as it looks. barely anything to do with toddlers, but on the plus the lifeguards are doing a good job. the evening entertainment was ok. but didnt start til 9.30pm nothing going on before that. at night outside its very dark it needs more lights.was glad to go home. if you go you need a lot of money unless you plan to go off site to eat. 
-2; Although was just a one night stay I was sorry I booked this room. The staff were very helpful but the hotel is run down and shabby. I found the bed very low and uncomfortable. The meal also had its problems, although the staff offered a free drink to make up for the problem, which we did not want. We normally are very satisfied itch premier inns, so this was a shame. 
-2; We stayed here for one night as part of a weekend getaway. Sadly, the hotel website makes this look like a modern and stylish hotel. It's not. The room we had was outdated with a very old bathroom. Yes, there is a lake in the middle so that's quite nice but it was starting to flood our balcony so our door to outside had a warning sign not to open the door.   The hotel had an electicity failure during the night so we had no lights and could not use the bathroom in the morning and breakfast was cancelled because of this. We had our money back. 
-2; We tried this premises for a second time to see if it was any better without a disabled person, unfortunately there was no improvement, we were sat at a table by a French door, the door had not been cleaned for sometime it was full of cobwebs, and dried on food and drink, the staff again took 30 minutes or more to come to take our order, we were the first ones seated and the last to be served. Again there were only 3 tables in use totalling 6 people and two people using the bar area. Even the female duty manager was rude and ignored everyone.  Unfortunately the meal was awful as well 
-2;" I stayed in this hotel a number of times for business (and lack of much better alternatives in the area). Although the hotel is currently being refurbished (according to posters in the hotel), the rooms are in terrible repair (holes in the carpet, partly broken furniture, very old-fashioned interior design). During my most recent stay, I found a carpet/clothes moth and reported this to reception. The reception staff was nice and offered the property manager. However, this manager reacted very annoyed to my complaint and asked whether there were &quot;lots of moths&quot; and what I expected them to do. Only after this unfriendly comment, he offered me to give me another room. Furthermore, the TV and WiFi (which costs almost £15 per day if purchased individually!!!) often does not work properly. I know that many of my colleagues had similar complaints or were put into freshly painted rooms. Generally, the hotel staff seems to have given up considering the poor state of repair of their hotel. On the positive side, the breakfast is good and inroom dining is tasty and fast (although the tray charge of £5 is quite excessive compared to other hotel chains). The gym is fairly small but clean and has the most important facilities. "
-2; I have not written a review ever but felt that I needed to. Having picked this hotel from the web site and it being 4 star I thought it would be a safe bet for a city centre hotel. On arrival we were given no information at all, just our room keys and what floor we were on. The room was clean but tired: stained carpet and the bathroom was just not finished properly. I wondered why ear plugs were provided especially as we were on the 8th floor. The traffic noise was high but it was the drunken people in the bar or club opposite that kept me awake. This was Sunday night, so unexpected. I chose not to stay for my second night as I was so tired and needed a decent night's sleep. On leaving the receptionist did not enquire as to how my stay had been but mentioned I would have to pay for the un-used night which I knew and was prepared to do. If this had been 2 star I would have perhaps accepted some of the issues. The only positive I can feed back was the closeness to the town centre. 
-2; I stayed here a couple of years ago with a friend and we had a wonderful time - I couldn't fault it. It was therefore the obvious choice for a surprise treat for my friend's 30th birthday. I booked us on the Friday night package and booked a treatment for us each.   On our arrival, we checked in and the room was fine. We headed to the spa where it turned out that our treatments had been booked for different times and not both at 5pm as I had booked over the phone. Less than ideal as we were there for a girlie weekend and wanted to spend time in the spa together, not alone while the other had their treatment. I explained the mistake to the spa manager who wasn't interested, didn't offer an apology nor attempt to compensate us for the error. The therapist who did the treatments was excellent, it was just a shame the spa manager had such a terrible attitude and bad customer service.  The spa area is looking dated now, was quite grubby and is in desperate need of a make over. There weren't enough loungers for everyone and the two heated loungers were dominated by one couple for the entire time we were there. I had assumed we would get robes but this wasn't included in our package, which was disappointing. To top off a bad stay, the sauna was too hot and stripped the coating from my glasses, they were ruined and it has cost me hundreds of pounds to get them replaced. I have worn them in spas in the past and always remove them and hold them in my hand. There was no warning outside the sauna.   On checking out, someone had charged two beers to our room, even though we specified that we would settle bills as we went along rather than pay on check out - the receptionist admitted this charge was an oversight by the bar staff. It was rectified and we didn't have to pay, of course.  There were a couple of good points: the dinner was nice and service professional and we were offered a complimentary drink for my friend's birthday. Breakfast was of the same high standard as I had remembered.   A really disappointing stay which ended up costing me much more than it should have. 
-2;" We, 3, arrived for a lunch booked for 12.30 pm on Saturday, at 12.30 pm. There was nobody at reception and no way of summoning anyone. Eventually we were seated at 12.45pm. Not a good start. We ordered mains and of course had to wait some time, when the sea bass came it looked very pretty but 3 pieces of fish each 4 sq inches seemed minimalist. There was a small spoonful of ratatouille and some creamed barley? . This was surrounded by a bright orange sauce. My husband's fried fish came in a small parcel with chips in a glass and a long narrow band of bright green mushy peas. Our son also had the sea bass. The puddings were small and pretty. A visual delight but not satisfying. As my husband said &quot;I don't ever want to go there again. Cost £63. Hours "
-2;" My friends and I had booked a table at this event as we enjoy the music of both Michael Bublé and the Rat Pack. With a meal as well, in a lovely setting, it promised to be a great night.  Sadly not! The meal was nice but was served much later than expected. The Bublé tribute singer was good, but when time was getting on and he sang a couple of Rat Pack numbers, we realised that the advertised Bublé tribute &quot;joined by the Rat Pack&quot; was just 1 person singing songs from both. To us, it had been advertised and promoted incorrectly and we were disappointed, especially as the evening had cost us each a considerable amount of money. "
-2;" We were expecting a much higher quality of room based on the high price we paid for it.   We booked two rooms, one of which was acceptable, but the other stank of cigarette smoke despite being a non-smoking room. We called reception who suggested air freshener in the room, which was unacceptable. In the end we were offered another room at the opposite end of the hotel which was a real shame as this was a special occasion and we were nowhere near our friends.   The room didn't reflect the high price; it was similar to that of a 3 star hotel apart from the extra space. There weren't any extras eg. a bathrobe, and overall didn't have the 'wow' factor. At night the rooms were very stuffy due to the radiator being on at full blast all night. Perhaps a more visible temperature control or thermostat would be useful in the room.   However, the staff were friendly and the location of the hotel was perfect for shopping in the city centre.   My last point would be that the website needs to be changed to be clearer on what the rooms are like, as I feel we were misled due to the lack of photos for the standard and executive rooms. The photos of the more expensive suites suggest your room will be of a similar style, which was a bit of a let down when we saw our room. "
-2;"I visited this newly opened Marco Pierre White restaurant and hotel for a party lunch with a group of 70 older people. The building is Victorian and very attractive outside and the grounds look delightful. Firstly, the entrance porch had an unexpected and unmarked shallow step in the middle, not very safe for our group. Then, having never visited one of MPW's restaurants before, I was taken aback by the bizarre decor - the walls were painted a dark charcoal, and covered with hundreds of pictures from floor to ceiling, mostly of weird and repulsive heads, death masks etc. Glass shelves covered the windows, bearing a collection of death masks, animal skeletons, and other strange and repulsive artefacts. I am told that MPW collects taxidermy! An archway from one section of the lounge to another had an electric cable and plug across the floor - very dangerous! Later, a chair was placed in this entry to stop people using it. Toilet facilities were in one of the corridors - a large room with two washbasins and one loo was all that was available for ladies - which meant a very long queue and a long wait. There was plenty of space in this room to partition a section to provide another loo - so why not? Lunch was served in a long narrow room with a low wooden ceiling - possibly an old orangery, which is probably the &quot;banqueting room&quot;. 70 people all talking at once meant that the noise was overwhelming. The menu had been available in advance and we had all chosen from a list of 3 items per course. Our names and food choices had been given to the management by our organiser, and the restaurant then provided place cards with menu choices on the back. On my table of 10, almost all of us had at least one mistake on our place cards - misspelled names, wrong choice of starter or dessert etc etc. My starter choice was soup, which might have been delicious had it not been served almost cold, probably because it stood waiting while the other (cold) starters were served. Strangely, we were not allowed a side plate if we didn't have soup. The main course was fine, lovely salmon placed on a very small pile of vegetables - and I did get the pudding of my choice after a short tussle.  The staff were clearly overwhelmed by our large party; they tried but frankly, good management appeared to be sadly lacking."
-2; This hotel has the smallest rooms in London and as a result you are lucky not to bump into the bed and tables in your room. The shower screen was attached to the bath which made it difficult to run water for the bath - you actually had to get in the bath to achieve that unless your arms were as long as your legs! Not the Double Tree normal standard 
-2; I was travelling back from a holiday in Rhodes with my two children. As our flight arrived very late into Gatwick we decided to extend the break in Brighton. The Grand had always been full on previous trips so I was pleased to get a room. On arrival around 1a.m. the check in took sometime as the systems had been shutdown. The member of staff who checked us in was very friendly and helpful so no complaints there. At breakfast my son ordered kippers. After 15 minutes I chased the waiter he said that he did get some but couldn't remember who they were for and now they had run out. He was not happy -not the typical thing I offer for breakfast at home so it was a real treat. We had a lovely day out and when we got back to the room around 5 it hadn't been cleaned.I complained to reception who offered to clean it now but my kids were exhausted so it wasn't an option. I asked housekeeping to restock the tea tray so I could have the vital cup of coffee for the following morning. When I woke very early as usual and went to the tray they hadn't left milk - fantastic! The basics!!! De Vere what are you doing if you can't get the basics right - what can I say. We all agreed that the Hilton next door had offered a far better stay previously and we shall be heading there again on our next visit to Brighton... 
-2; Like other reviews very impressed by entrance and size of car park! First room we were offered in main house was far too hot, offered a ground floor room apparently as an upgrade, 4 poster bed and jacuzzi bath, very nice till we went to bed and there was an unbearable buzzing coming from the other side of the wall, my husband tried to phone reception, went out to reception but we discovered there is no night receptionist! Not sure what happens in case of emergency! After a sleepless night we told the receptionist we would pay for the food we had eaten but not the room, she arranged for the duty manager aka the owner to speak to us, he agreed not to charge us and moved us again, at last a room with no buzzing and no traffic noise (turned out the noise was from a fridge in the adjacent marquee). Food in restaurant ok but they can't handle more than 2 tables at a time! Second night half the menu was not available, our first choice was apparently not fit to serve, so we opted for the salmon which arrived uncooked and had obviously come out of the freezer, we were very disappointed and would not stay at this hotel again. 
-2; I booked a weeked break for my hsuband as a spurpirse for his birthday. I booked The Lancaster to stay as it was in a central location and appeared to be good value. Sadly this was not the case. The room was not very clean. When I spoke to reception the young lady was not interested in the slightest. Breakfast on the first morning was alright. On the second morning it was awful, my husband ordered fried egg and I decided on poached, these took 25 mintues to arrive. When I spoke to a member of staff I was told I would have to wait as they were busy. If I wasn't happy have the scrambled eggs that were on the buffet! The rest of the buffet was just about warm. I was amazed at the price of the water in the mini bar. On check out I was asked if everything had been alright with our stay, when I started to mention about the eggs I was told I should of complained in the restaturant. We are regular visitors to London but will not be staying here again. 
-2;" We stayed here for our wedding night and the following night. It was disappointing and very overpriced.   It has a very special central and has been restored with absolute care and precision. The front and back courtyards are enticing as they are surrounded by ancient walls that are typical of Oxford. Visitors are able to feel that they are sharing the experience of living in the magnificent culture of the area. However, it is on a very busy and noisy road, there are no views of the river and buses and lorries hurtle past at disturbing speeds.  Our room was very pleasant and the manager had kindly left a half bottle of champagne and a welcome note. We had a view of the rear courtyard which was not by any means breathtaking, but adequate. There were no facilities in the room to make tea or coffee and it was small, particularly the bathroom (which didn't have a bath).  The hotel is old, with a contemporary interior. The interior has been designed cleverly and with extreme taste. However, this cannot disguise the fact that the building is old with lots of narrow staircases and no lifts. We were not offered any help with our luggage when leaving and had to drag everything down the winding and narrow staircases (with numerous fire doors), ourselves.  There seems to be a general lack of experienced staff throughout the hotel. All the staff seem to be very young and Eastern European, which is disappointing when you are visiting a quintessentially English setting. Whilst friendly, the staff seem insincere and for the price we were paying, there most definitely was not a feeling of care or interest in the guests. Apart from the champagne being left in our room, no comments or special attention was given to us, despite the fact that they had been told this was our wedding night and that I arrived in my wedding dress. It was not at all &quot;special&quot; which was what we would have expected. The girls at reception were young, adequately efficient and unmemorable.  Breakfast, which wasn't included, was disappointing. The quality of food was good, but on the first morning, my fried eggs were raw and the egg white uncooked. The following day they were so overdone that they were like rubber and the bacon so overdone that I couldn't cut it. The tables are small and close together and there is an entire lack of privacy in the dining area.  Overall, I think this is a very pleasant hotel which could be so much better. It is vastly overpriced and we were very disappointed that we chose it for the start of our honeymoon. "
-2; We booked this hotel as a treat for my birthday, on arrival the receptionist showed us to our room, we found it to be a dark room that needed the lights on ,a hole in the wall,dirty tiles in the bathroom but most upsetting was the cover on the bed was stained, I reported this to another receptionist who said he would get it exchanged, it was exchanged for another one with stains , in the end they removed it from the room, I have worked in the hotel industry myself the housekeeper who checked the rooms would never have passed this room for use. This hotel is quite expensive and I don't think the quality justifies the prices they charge. On a brighter note the breakfast was good and a young receptionist named Patrick was very helpful and polite. 
-2;Was really excited about staying in the Manor House Hotel as we were considering it as a potential wedding venue. Beautiful gardens and decor. Firstly the car park was full as there was a wedding event so we had to scout the village for a parking spot.The room we stayed in was very small. The bathroom was quite spacious which was a big plus, however, when it came to using the shower the pressure was poor and then it stopped completely. When the water did return it was cold.  I mentioned it at check out to the receptionist and was disappointed by the customer service I was offered (or lack thereof should I say)
-2; Thought this would be a nice place as it was quite expensive for one night, wrong ,dirty carpets along the dark dingy corridors, piles of dirty sheets left most of the day, tiny room overlooking car park and food overpriced in the restaurant, stayed in march as it was close to airport, I would say though that the staff were pleasant and helpful. The hotel itself Could be improved so therefore would not stay again 
-2; Stayed at the hotel 2nd to 4th November. On checking in with my 80year old aunt we were given a disabled room which we did not ask for. The toilet was so high that my aunt or myself could not reach the floor when we sat on the loo. The wardrobe was designed for someone in a wheel chair as the hangers were waist high so you could not hang dresses in there, the other hangers were so high that my son who is over 6ft struggled to reach them. I did ask for a smoking room and it absolutely stank of stale cigarettes (room219) my son also had a smoking room (222) and this also stank. I know smoking is a dirty habit but the rooms literally smelled like old ash trays. Bacon was very undercooked and black pudding was like shoe leather, all in all i would never stay there agai. 
-2; The room was lovely, unfortunately that is the only good point I can say about the experience. The service at the bar was a joke, took over 5 minutes to get served 4 drinks, and then could not get my change as the till was locked. The 4 course meal took 2.25 hours to serve, and the food was not that good. The drinks were overpriced, £20 for cheapest bottle of wine. And to top it all off, two rooms next to ours were broken into, which meant the night was spent going back and forth to check the room had not been targeted. We were really on edge as the bottom of the window in our room was level with the ground outside, making the opening window waist height from the outside and round the back of the hotel, out of view, so not very secure at all. 
-2;First vision on walking in - a policeman taking a statement from a guest who had been mugged. Room over hot and temperature controls did not work, despite turning it to cold. None of the room windows opened. We could not regulate the heat - which made for a very poor nights sleep. Staff friendly and nice but over worked stressed and tired. There was a big event on when we went - be warned - do not go if an event on - 20 minutes for an over priced drink in a warm glass or a cold coffee. Tables not cleaned. 2 Waiters dropped cups/glasses all over the place (due to been stressed it seemed!)  None of the staff told us about the 10% discount for parking at Q Park even though we'd asked about parking. Another member of our party had phoned to ask about parking and they were not told either.   Also the room windows at the top where covered in cob webs! The toilet roll holder was hanging off the wall. The toiletries had forgotten to be refilled. Very off putting! Room 510. Very clean otherwise.   When I complained the Duty Manager said - this hotel might be too busy for you.
-2;"The George hotel in Solihull used to be a very smart town centre hostelry. My disappointment on arriving at the now so called Ramada was overwhelming. The lobby smells of detol and is basically shabby as is the whole of the rest of the hotel. We had room 107 which came complete with a shower that anybody taller than 5'10&quot; could not stand up in. The rooms are drab, the mattresses poor and the bed linen inexcusable. Breakfast was an interesting experience, in fairness very friendly service,no butter, as they were waiting for a delivery! Dried up selection of hot food, only mandarin flavoured yoghurt - shall continue? Surfice to say , exceptional position in the centre of Solihull, with parking, being abused. Don't go."
-2;I wouldn't normally write a review of a hotel but I felt I had to due to my disappointment. The hotel and grounds itself are beautiful and the check-in staff went above and beyond however, the issue is the paper thin walls. We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night and you could hear every word spoken by guests walking by in the corridoor and in the rooms next to us (the Friday night we had a room full of loud men clearly drinking who even knocked on our door at one point.) You could hear when either side plugged and unplugged devices and even when a guest next door was throwing up, which meant we got very little sleep.  We frequently stay in hotels and have never experienced so much noise and would expect far more from a hotel of this standard. It's a shame because the hotel itself is wonderful and would be great with some sound proofing.
-2; My New Year's Eve Party was great party only due to friends!!!   I was attending the New Year's Eve Party at the hotel and since it was a Christmas gift I called to find out what was the dress code. When I called the main number shown on the website nobody picked up so I called the number for general enquiries and the phone was picked up by a man who did not bother to introduce himself. I later found out that his name was Juro. At least this is what I think his name was as he was not too keen on spelling it and when he did it was done with a speed that would not allow me to actually write it down. When I asked Juro about the dress code he said that there is no party at the hotel. When I advised that I am looking at a ticket, Juro asked me to call back on Monday when Meetings and Events are in.  Juro put me on hold to find out if anything is happening on 31st December. In the meantime a girl picked up the phone, and asked if I can call later. Again, no name given. I think Juro was very irritated that I was persistent in my query. When he picked up the phone again, I expressed my disappointment that nobody knows anything about my Christmas Gift and then Juro began his rant. I learned that he was away on holidays and just came back so that is why he doesn't know anything about the party and then he did me a great favour by putting me on hold and finding things out for me and that now he has a function sheet and that he does not like the way I talk to him... Was that necessary? Do I need to care as a guest that Juro was on holidays and events were not communicated to him. Moreover, I believe he works at the bar which is an F&B outlet, so it's a bit scary that staff did not know anything about the party. I think a disappointment and shocked attitude of mine was quiet natural. And finally, did he really do me such a big favour?!   I also would like to point to the fact that I was so shocked that I sent a letter of complaint to events@gorehotel.com on 31st December already and to this day have received no reply. What a horrible customer service. 
-2; Today my partner and I visited the hotel spa as part of a Groupon offer.  Staff very nice and efficient.  Facilities are good with pool, gym, steam room and sauna BUT... The place was filthy. The floor around the pool was very dirty and my partner and I were quite disgusted. The showers had mats of hair in and the toilets were not clean. At no point did we see anyone cleaning around the pool area. The staff do need to pay more attention to the cleanliness of the place. A disappointing visit which was a treat for both of us after months of ill health.   
-2;" We stayed at The Angel for a friend's wedding in September. I was told at the time of booking there were no &quot;standard&quot; rooms available so we opted for their next level up (coach I think) which was £150 a night. We often stay in nice hotels and so expected quite a good room for this price per night. Sadly we were very disappointed. We were in a room facing the hotel car park. The curtains were faded by the sunlight as was the chair in the window. The room was small and extremely basic in design. Whilst the bed was reasonably comfortable, it had an exposed divan base which was a ghastly faded blue colour. Why not cover this?? The bathroom had sealant which was turning black around the edge of the bath. The carpet was worn and the general decor was very old fashioned. The hotel is in a very beautiful building and very central so I guess they think they can charge these high rates for poor quality rooms. The one positive was the breakfast which was delicious - not a buffet breakfast thankfully for this price! Sadly all our group staying at the hotel thought the rooms were definitely below average and we will not be returning. "
-2; First things first when we arrived nobody had bothered to collect payment for our stay even though all account details had been given at least a week before, because this was an all expense paid for stay for my 21st the reception staff then went on to take our account details if they did not get a payment soon. However eventually it was confirmed that they did have all the details they needed for this payment in the first place!  Following this we were sent up to the top floor of the hotel only to find that we had been given the wrong card key, my partner then went down to main reception to get the correct card key only to be given one that didn't even fit in the door!  We were eventually given the correct card key after 30 minutes of waiting outside our PAID FOR ROOM and were deeply disappointed with what we saw. This room was not at all at the standard that it was made out to be.  Also the room could have been cleaner and better maintained. Such as toilet and towel rail (which had rust on it). Restaurant had very little choice and no prices on the menu. Last but not least it is advertised to be stratford but would cost at least a £40 round taxi fare just to get there and back. Overall very poor would not recommend. 
-2; I went for a facial as a Mother's Day gift. I was told I could use the facilities as part of the deal and rang up to find out what was available. They hadn't heard of me. This was typical of the day. Staff seem to have had little or no training in making guests welcome.  I chose to have a swim. The 'whirlpool' emptied into the main swimming pool so it was disappointingly tepid and at one point I even had cold jets of water swirling round my legs. The swimming pool had a nice view through big curved plate windows - which had not been washed in a very long time. The actual facial was fine. The girl knew her job and did it efficiently. 
-2; Where do I start with this hotel!   1- I e-mail the contact us section on the website twice with no reply and when I mentioned this they just looked at me blankley and said they didn’t receive anything even though I had the auto response.  2- We went down to the pool and there was a young guy in the Jacuzzi on his phone swearing and when a guest confronted him to say take it outside he started to kick off. This isn’t something a guest should have had to do, the lifeguard should of told him to get out as no one wants to hear that type of language when they are having a relaxing swim.  3- There was a party going on that we were not advised about at check in. This went on until 1am. We were on the 2nd floor and we could hear the songs word for word.   4- There was also a couple having a massive argument in the corridor right outside our room!  5- Cleaners put the music on full blast next door at 9am in the morning and shouting to each other down the corridor.  This hotel is an absolute joke! I felt like I was staying in a hostel and I’m also still waiting on a phone call from a manager 5 days on from check out as the receptionist asked if everything was ok….. erm no its not. I wish we stayed at the Premier Inn over the road at least they have a good night sleep guaranteed and if you’re not happy you get the money back. 
-2; We stayed here recently the weekend of our engagement. My (now) fiance proposed on the way that morning and took me there for the night. He had rang the week before and booked the best room (which was a beautiful room at the front of the hotel) and asked for champagne and flowers in the room, I obviously had no idea of this. We were greeted nicely and shown personally to the room where there was champagne waiting. I then went for the spa treatment which was very average although the girl was lovely. I found out afterwards that while I was there my fiance spoke to the lady at reception and also the manager about the flowers not being in the room and she said that he never asked for them and was adamant about this. He knew he had but she would not back down. I completely believe in the customer is right (especially when they are!) He also explained that we had got engaged that morning and there was still no budging or any compensation. He had made them aware that we got engaged that day and also had been disappointed and upset with something that he had arranged that would have made it a little more special for me. Throughout the night and the next day we got no little treat or anything such as a drink at dinner, chocolates in the room, nothing to make up for what happened or even just to congratulate us on our engagement. They did not care that they had upset him on the day of our engagement or try and make amends or apologise in some way. I know friends of mine have went to other hotels for their engagement and have received champagne at dinner and breakfast in bed etc. This hotel seems to do the bare minimum and are not interested in doing that little bit extra and do not take responsibility for their actions. It is disappointing, given that it is such a lovely building. In terms of food, my other half enjoyed his meal immensely, mine was distinctly average. 
-2;checked in with 12 month old baby, put in lodge style room upstairs carrying a baby and pram up and down stairs no joke ! requested full size cot they gave me pull out sofa ! and was later told only had travel cots wish they would have told me that when i booked and requested full size cot in room. Took them 5 hours to come back with travel cot as no alternative. Drains in our room were backing up so when you had shower which was over bath all black hair and slime came flo
-2; Mattress so firm my body had pins and needles. If I had slept on floor, I might have got some rest. I cat napped for few minutes at a time before being woken by discomfort. Noise from traffic. Lift complicated to use, no instruction from check in. No signs telling you where to scan room key to allow access to floor. Room clean. Shower in bath not user friendly. Wish I had done my research before booking this hotel but my internet had been down. Good location for hospital but I will never return! 
-2; OK, This wasn't the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. And whilst it is architecturally suspect at best, the room was spotless and the bathroom immaculate and the bed comfy. and we were looking out rather than in so what the heck. View over to the lake was lovely. Check in was fine but All the guest information is on the TV, only ours wasn't working for the whole of our two day stay despite several trips to the room by various staff members. At least they managed to get the wifi going for my laptop (or it might have been ugly - unwise to get between an addict and Candy Crush Saga...) The public areas are all a little tired and the lift gave up the ghost on the Sunday. The pool area desite protestations to the contrary when I spoke of my unhappiness to the reception is entirely unsupervised and it resembled nothing so much as the Wild West with kids feeling free to 'bomb' into the pool (even the shallow end which was a little heart stopping - can only assume parents were bored with their offspring). The jacuzzi was normally packed out with kids too, despite signs proclaiming it out of bounds to under 12. Towels had also run out - generally appalling state of affairs to be honest. There were quite a number of places were things had come away from walls or ceilings etc Whilst the Saturday morning buffet breakfast was good, it was ill attended and most things ran out and ere left empty for too long (even more true the next morning). On the Sunday I decided to go for the smoked haddock with poached egg. Dear Mercure - the poached egg was inedible and I left the rubbery remnant to one side. Frankly the smoked haddock bore more resemblance to a smoked goldfish and was overcooked and curled up rock hard round the edges. The waiter who took our order promptly disappeared for over 15 mins so we were left coffee-less. I stood for a while and commiserated with another guest who had asked four times for glasses for the juice - not that it did him much good as the juice had run out too.  I find this all rather annoying as dinner the night before had been rather excellent and the staff friendly and accomodating. I presume it is a different bunch on early morning duty. I noted with amusement that the restaurant manager, in contrast with the night before, very carefully didn't ask anyone if they were alright and everything OK. There had been a large function the night before and I suspect that they were caught unaware by the numbers who turned up at once. But do I care? Not one bit. Even if they were incapable of reading how many guests they were going to need to cater for That does not excuse the poor quality of my breakfast. Or the general lack of staff. In precis - reception staff were absolutely lovely and charming but couldn't fix any problems. Evening waiting staff likewise lovely. Breakfast waiting staff need a serious looking at. Swimming pool needs closing by Health and Safety. And I would suggest they consider holding one printed copy of the guest directory in the office for instances of broken TVs. There was a small Fire Evacuation notice on the back of the door which probably kept them legal but whilst it told you where to assemble, it didn't have a map or instructions on how to get there. I would sincerely suggest looking elsewhere for a relaxing weekend - Maybe the Hilton down the road if you are looking for a medium/large hotel with attendent facilities. Or pick a smaller hotel with more character. But unless hell just froze over, I shall not be returning. Do yourself a favour and do not even try. 
-2; We had booked through LastMinute.com for a couples spa weekend, which included 2 massages as part of the price. After booking the room, we then contacted the hotel directly and booked in our spa sessions ( which is what the website recommended) a month in advance and then counted down the days to our trip. We had been looking forward to a relaxing spa break for months, only to arrive at the hotel and be told that they had no record of our booking and the hotel was full. We were understandably upset, and after being offered a tea, the receptionist came over and said that she had managed to move someone else out of a double room into a single. We were very grateful and thought that maybe our weekend might not be a flop. We spent some time in the sunny conservatory (lovely..but very expensive drinks..London prices) and then used the gym. We had hoped to use the jacuzzi, but it looked unclean. The reason I am giving the hotel such a low rating is because we did not actually get to sleep until 1.30am due to a wedding being held in the venue. After lying in bed for over an hour listening to constant thumping bass and screaming, I rang reception (at this point it was 11.45pm). I asked when the music would be turned off and was told it would be turned off at 12.30am. We were then kept awake by all of the drunk guests who were then wandering the corridors after the wedding ended, looking for their rooms and then using their facilities (the walls are paper thin). My partner and I woke up feeling exhausted and left the hotel in the morning without using the spa, or taking up the offer of massages- Quite frankly we wanted to get back to our own peaceful abode. It's a shame that this hotel advertises itself as a relaxing retreat..I'm sure it is when there isn't a wedding on..but on this occasion our weekend was ruined by lack of sleep and a hard bed. We will not be returning. 
-2; Drinking in the sports bar I found the de-caf coffee was only cheap instant but the same price as ground per cup. A small pot of tea was nearly £2 and the coffee was very expensive. Most places support fair trade but this place but not Barnham Broom. 
-2; In its heyday this place would have been amazing, but it is no longer the 1930's and we no longer do the Charleston!   On arrival, down a steep flight of steps from the car park with our luggage, we had a warm welcome and easy check-in. The room was lovely and spacious with separate lounge and double aspect view from lounge, big balcony adorned by cheap white plastic furniture which had seen many storms over many years!  The bathroom was old and outdated with the shower curtain rail held up with Tank Tape! The lounge and bedroom décor was old fashioned but the antique furniture suited the room though there was a slightly fusty smell, and the wardrobe doors falling off their hinges. The trouser press and attached iron and board hung next to the bed seemed well past is sell by date and should be removed especially as our 5 year daughter could easily turn the iron on, so a health and safety issue.  When we checked into our room, we found they had forgotten to put in the extra bed for our daughter but this was quickly rectified. However, the service or should I say lack of in the bar/lounge was a joke. I queued at the bar waiting to be served only to be told that after waiting 8 mins I had missed afternoon tea by 1 minute, I did ask if the was any flexibility as I had been queuing only to be told it was served from 2-5pm and that should be plenty of time and I should have been on time!!! The blank none helpful none engaging and frankly smirking look I got back was to set the tone for the rest of our 2 days.  We went into the leisure area where, if you found a locker with a lock still attached to the door was a challenge in itself, with wet dirty slippery floors, dirty used towels left everywhere, and a shower that made very little effort to get you wet. The pool area was littered with an array of pool toys not being used, and the Jacuzzi was hot enough to boil and egg in. We chatted to others in the Jacuzzi only to be warned about the very poor service in the restaurant, which we felt did not bode well, yet we braved it anyway.  The restaurant was light and bright and had amazing views, with lovely comfy chairs, but the aircon made it feel like winter, and I think it was set so low so you did not block tables for later diners. The is a set evening menu with also a specials which were extra, but only a buffet that had been put out at 6pm for the children, but as we could only get a table for 8pm and only served our main by 8.45pm this meant it had been out for nearly 3 hours, not good!  A good night’s sleep followed and buffet breakfast the next morning was good but not amazing, with it also being a free for all for tea and coffee as the kitchen machines had broken! An alarm test was supposed to take place at 11.30am but the silence was dramatically disturbed at 10.40am by the fire alarms sounding, only for the alarms to be so loud that you could not hear the recorded announcement to evacuate the building. Over 40 minutes later of standing in a car park were we allowed back in with no sorry or explanation.  Will we go back, no! Does it rely on its past history, old elegance and the amazing views, yes! 
-2; We used this hotel as we had an early flight the next morning. The car parking facility is ok as we left our car for 4 nights.  The decor in the hotel lobby and bar/restaurant is average but the room we stayed in was poor. The decor was like something out the 1970's it was very shabby with dark old furniture. The bed was not very comfortable either. The bathroom was really small and not very modern but fairly clean.  The bus route service to the airport took about 25 mins each way as it stopped at various other hotels. Normally we prefer a hotel that offers a direct link to the airport.   I would not use this hotel again because of the standard of the hotel and the distance from the airport. I would rather pay and be nearer to the airport terminal. 
-2; This was a very special 90th birthday celebration lunch for my mum, 26 of us in total. The starters were very nice but the main course was a big disappointment. The roast beef was very nice but everything came already plated up with the rather boring vegetables and gravy already applied. Separate tureens with the vegetables and gravy in would have been more appropriate. We weren't asked how rare we would like the beef. The salmon choice came with only a tiny amount of vegetable. But by far the worst meal was the vegetarian option of baked smoked onion dish. It was a very small meal, pretty but basically a dismantled onion sprinkled with a few tiny bits of cheese and bread with no accompanying vegetables. When we asked for some and for those having salmon they came after a long wait but the broccoli that came was straight out of the fridge! Cooked but fridge cold! When this was pointed out the waiter took it to reheat but it never returned! The people having the roast dinner had finished their meal in the meantime. To expect this dish to suffice as a main meal was ridiculous, it certainly wouldn't fill James Martin whose name was at the top of the menu. Also when a waiter was asked what the Yorkshire Fettle was, something included in the onion dish, they didn't know. Surely a basics requirement is for the staff to understand the menu. The desserts were very small and the sticky toffee pudding barely warm. The almond pear dessert was tasteless. On the plus side the room was very nice, but with the bill coming to over £900 plus the cost of some members of the party staying over for two nights it was a huge disappointment. James Martin is obviously very busy these days but the Talbot trades on his name and I would expect something better than this. I've had better at the local pub and the nearby 'The Yard'. James Martin is from Malton and as a fellow local I would like to be able to recommend the Talbot to others but unfortunately this is not the case. I was moved to write to James Martin, recorded delivery and also on Twitter and have been awaiting a response but he obviously doesn't care enough 
-2;" I had stayed here before it became Mercure in the eighties and was on a nostalgic trip back, trying to book a 40th birthday party for my daughter. We went to reception and asked for tea, and were told there wasn't any afternoon tea till three o clock but if we wanted to sit in the garden someone would come and take our order for coffees and juice for the children. Well we waited for 40 minutes, and then I went to ask at reception. She said she would get someone to us, no apology offered. Ten minutes later a waiter turns up and says &quot;you want some coffees or tea do you?&quot; very unfriendly as though we were a nuisance. Well yes we said and maybe cake and juice for the children? Well what cake do you want, he said offering no choice, then seeing my surprised expression, said carrot cake, brownie what? Well we had our coffees, juices and cake and left. The hotel is lovely, the pool and grounds are excellent, and the situation is marvellous. But I won't be booking my party there, because the service is abysmal. "
-2; I stayed for a night here as a good friend of mine had her wedding reception here. Receptionist was not friendly at all. I cant comment much on the restaurant but the food at my friend's wedding reception was mediocre at best. I forgot my favourite cardigan sweater when I checked out and when I called the hotel to find out if it was with them, recepionist connected me to housekeeping who never answered any of my calls or messages. I kept calling for the next few days but still no reply from housekeeping. I tried to complain to the receptionist but all she did was connect me again to housekeeping. Needless to say, I never got my sweater back. I definitely would not recommend this hotel. Bad service! 
-2; Very average hotel. Expected a much higher standard from a Hilton hotel.  Room was clean however was very small. We requested one of the refurbished rooms which are on the top floor. We didn't manage to get much sleep however due to very thin walls and a continuous clunking from the elevator mechanisms above are room even although we were 3 rooms away from the elevator.  Pool was very poor! Definitely needs a revamp!   There is a good selection of food at the breakfast buffet and the staff were very welcoming and helpful.   
-2; My Husband stayed here a few years ago and was looking forward to sharing the experience a second time, with me. From the surface the hotel looks amazing. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the bathroom is lush.l However the beds are awful, wooden slatted bases which make a loud noise every time you move and a very naff mattress on top. The nice touches were fresh milk in the mini bar and a nespresso machine.  I cannot fault the reception team , nor the bar staff who made us very welcome. However the restaurant team let you down badly. On an evening when only 7 tables were occupied we were left 20 minutes after our booking before being seated. The waiter took an age to come and take our order and there was a delay of 40 minutes- yes 40, between Paul's starter and our main course. During this time the several waiters and waitresses were in and out of the kitchen, talking to one particular couple who were obviously regulars and ignoring the rest of us. An Aussie at the table nearest to us actually got up and went to search for someone to take his order - Where was the maitre d'? I assume he was the chap who spent an inordinate amount of time looking at his computer screen whilst ignoring his clientele. My main course was fine - no more no less, and after a further 15 minutes I managed to holler at a waiter who came to take our dessert order. My profiterole arrived - 3 small melting lumps of ice cream in a stale flat pastry case with no chocolate sauce. By this time I was no longer the meek English woman and I summoned the chap from his computer screen and demanded he take it away... he then questioned ME as to why there was no chocolate sauce on the dish! Incidently the OH had a cheese platter where all cheeses were the hard variety and only 1 type of cracker to accompany it. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. 
-2;" I have just returned from a stay at Redworth Hall & can only say it's the poorest hotel I have stayed in for some years. Our bed room was dated and shabby with peeling paper, worn carpet with debris sticking to i, dusty window sill sand broken window locks. The bathroom was worse with cracked mismatching tiling, a shower that couldn't be used properlu as a shower since the shower head didn't appear to fit the rail that supported it properly and distinctly dodgy plumbing where it took more than 5 mminutes for the toilet to refill sufficiently to flush again.  Whilst the original house shown on the website is unquestionably beautiful it appears most guests are accommodated in a soulless rambling what appears to be a 1970s brick built extension. Contrary to how it appears on it's publicity material the dining room used is a windowless low ceiling affair. The decor in corridors stairwells etc is tired and extensively marked. On the positive side in addition to the stunning frontage the grounds are lovely & the staff were friendly . I did complain but was told that there were no bedrooms free that we could be moved to.  Barcelo class this as one of their &quot;premier&quot; hotels.If our stay was a reflection of their standards I can only advise travellers to think longnd hard before booking one of their ordinary hotels "
-2; This was advertised as a spa package as a friend and I visited as we had purchased a variety of treatments. We were not notified that the pool was being occupied by mum and baby swimming all morning so we were limited to swimming lengths whilst listening to nursery rhymes, not exactly the relaxation we had in mind. The sauna heat was not hot enough and could fit 4 people max and same problems with the steam room. No jacuzzi which was disappointing. The changing rooms were dirty, water logged and the ceiling was dripping and actually leaking. Due to the swimming classes there was hardly any room to change. The actual spa treatments were fantastic which was the saving grace and the reason I am scoring the hotel 2/5 I had the best facial iv ever had and actually dozed off during my massage very relaxing indeed! I would rate the treatments 5/5. Word of warning when having treatments whilst using the 'spa' you will have to walk outside of the pool area past the entrance desk by the exit doors to the treatment rooms in your towel, no dressing gowns or flip flop/slippers provided, all in All a poor experience. If you want a spa break do not bother coming here but for a one of treatment such as a facial i would come here but never again for the facilities they really let the Hilton group down. After our treatments we had lunch in the bar opposite, delicious but small portions. Overall such a disappointing experience. It's a shame this beauty room is in this Hilton hotel. 
-2;" I would really have liked to give this three stars, but it was expensive (despite the discount I got through hotelstayuk). The bed was quite comfy, although it was a bit shabby for a 4 star hotel.  The reason I kept muttering &quot;Premier Inn does this better&quot; was due to the lack of making my stay feel special. At 4 stars (and that price), I expect something better.  For example, I arrived at 9pm on a Sunday and asked if the guy behind the desk knew where (my favourite) the nearest Wagamama's was. Firstly he didn't understand the question, then he offered to google it. I said I would do it myself and then explained to him that it was a Japanese restaurant. He then directed me to a fast food takeaway in Victoria Station. Not ideal for a woman on her own reasonably late at night. Premier Inn usually know these things.  Then it transpired I had forgotten to pack my toothpaste. I asked if they had any. When I finally managed to mime what I wanted (the girl misunderstood me as saying &quot;toothpicks&quot;, of which I now have a useful stash), they didn't do it. Premier Inn do.  Then I went to the toilet. When I washed my hands, I had to use shampoo. It was either that or the shower gel. No soap was left in the bathroom. Premier Inn provides soap.  Then, I went to watch the TV. There were only 3 channels available. Right enough, I have stayed in a Premier Inn where the remote didn't have any batteries, but once they were put in so I could switch the TV on, there were more than 3 channels available. To be fair, the manager did try to re-tune the telly, but it wasn't a great success.  Then I went to breakfast the next morning. I wanted tap water. The lady snatched the jug away and dashed back in to the kitchen. Then I tried the cranberry juice. That too was snatched away (even though the jug was clearly full). The &quot;continental breakfast&quot; was a bit of feta/goats cheese, ham, tomatoes, cucumber, boiled eggs, fruit salad, one cereal choice (no bowls) and some miniature croissants or miniature rolls. The choice at the Premier Inn is better.  Every morning, I was asked (on some occasions multiple times) for my room number. I did not feel like a valued guest. I was repeatedly pestered about whether I wanted toast. Premier Inn does not do this.  Then, on my last night, I tried to order room service. I was told they didn't have the soup of the day. The manager corrected her. Then I asked for an item on the menu and it didn't arrive after an hour. I wandered back to the reception area and was told it would take another ten minutes (probably the length of time it takes to prepare from scratch). I cancelled my order. I was offered a free drink on the house, but I was hungry, not thirsty. Premier Inn does do room service much better than that (even if you do need to carry it to your room yourself).  The one good thing about the hotel was the location. It was very convenient for Victoria Station, and as I said, the bed was very comfy. There was also a minibar and a (ridiculously slow) lift.   I am by no means a fan of Premier Inn (I have been heard to say that Sir Lenny has gone down in my estimation since he became the face of the chain), but I would have rather taken my chances with a comedy week in London for much less. After all, everything there is premier except the price. The Tophams would do well to think about adopting this as their tagline.... "
-2;" I stayed here with my family for one night prior to our early morning flight the next day.  Check in was slow and we were allocated a room on the third floor. We walked along the corridors and I was immediately met with a smell of damp. Upon opening the room door we were met with a very dated room with a double bed and a set of cheap looking metal framed bunk beds at one end. We were very disappointed to say the least as this is not what we expect of a Hilton Hotel.  We did speak to the management as we had booked a &quot;family room&quot; (with no mention of the said bunk beds) but they were unable to offer any acceptable solution and we had no choice but to stay in the room.  This was by far and away the worst Hilton I have stayed in and we were disappointed by the poor customer service from the hotel management. We will look for an alternative hotel next time we are at Gatwick.   This hotel is in drastic need of a make over. I don't book a Hilton Hotel to get a dated room with cheap metal bunk beds stuck in the corner as an after thought. This hotel lets down the Hilton brand name. "
-2; Excellent facilities for children, with helpful, friendly staff and only a short walk to the city..however. Only 1 pillow supplied per person (which was 3cm thick at a push). Plus only enough towels supplied for 2 people in our room when there were 3. No toiletries either which really surprised me.   I did request extra pillows earlier in the day, still hadn't received by 11pm. Had to ask again.   Can't fault the staff or location, just make sure you pack bottled water, as a small bottle for £2.50 each in your room is a little extreme for a budget hotel. 
-2; Hmm reviews v v misleading! Hotel is joined to halls of residence inside uni campus. Hotel staff are all students, nice enough but not too helpful. This is not what it appears!! Beware! Cant believe people get married here its like a hospital. Dirty carpets, strip lighting, no atmosphere. Rooms are nice but v small and breakfast takes an hour and is def not worth the wait. We left after 25mins after hearing comments from 5guests at the table beside us who had been waiting over an hour. Very very surprised! Not what we were expecting after reading reviews on here is reason we booked! Never mind! It happens I was just disappointed because I took the trouble to check first before booking. 
-2;" Stayed here on a Friday night after seeing a concert in the LG arena. Paid £80 for a room which has certainly seen better days and bathroom was grubby. Service in the bar after the concert was absolutely disgraceful with 3 members of staff trying to serve over 100 people, utter chaos... Yet there were other members of staff in the restaurant not doing anything; when approached to ask if anyone else could help (after already waiting 30 minutes to try and get a drink) I got a blunt no and if I wanted anyone to go to reception... Helpful! I did venture to reception to find more chaos with one person trying to check in a queue of 8 and having no record of a booking... Again no one had any time for me. Housekeeping woke us up at 8am to clean our room even though we were only staying one night and check out at 11; annoying! All in all, overpriced, poorly staffed, staff they have got deliver zero customer service skills and a very disappointing visit. General lack of management and leadership, no one had a clue how to run a hotel that was there that night. Avoid at all costs, Hilton brand name tarnished by this hotel. "
-2; Though I live in London, I checked in to this hotel as we had a late night event in area. I travel often and so stay in at least one hotel per month - this is worst I've ever been to. We were in suite but the non-stop door slamming made it impossible to sleep or to concentrate when not sleeping. Every minute or two there was another loud door slam. After many complaints, the hotel manager did move us to the top floor where door slamming is not as bad as lower floors, but don't stay here if you need sleep. Much better hotels in London for this price range.   I will avoid all Hilton Hotels in future just because of this experience. 
-2; Whilst this hotel is 4 star for us on our visit 1/10/11 this was not so!! Yes rooms very clean but to small as is the bathroom. There was a function on the evening of our visit so put in another restaurant in hotel, food very dissapointing, lack of presentation etc. Outside on the balconey tables full of glasses, ash trays full, when l made my comments to reception they told me they had a staff shortage! Very sorry, but we wont recomend to a friend or stay there again.I wish we had not pre booked and paid for dinner and eaten elsewere, we would not have been aware of all these issues. 
-2; My partner and I stayed at the Langstone In May 2015. The staff were friendly, however the room we were given was very tired!! and the air con was not working and it was fairly hot , the extractor in the bathroom also not working, various lights didnt work and were never replaced during our 3 night stay. When our rooms were cleaned they left dirty cups in the room and not enough towels. They also tried to charge us for breakfast's we didnt have, as the breakfast was very expensive. I dont ever leave bad reviews however I felt I didnt get value for money and as a result wont be staying there again. Its a shame as its in a lovely location 
-2;We stayed a couple of weekends ago. Great room although a bit stuffy. No hot water first morning but we were given a discount on check out.  Appalling breakfast service both morning. Plenty of staff all achieving nothing.  Bar area poor. Very pleasant dinner but wine totally overpriced with a 250ml carafe costing £12.50, when just around the corner a bar was charging £6.50.  Double parking outside the hotel cost £28.50.  Would we return ? Probably not.
-2;Stayed for 1 night on a business trip. On checking in our reservations could not be found and waited for 20 mins to be checked in. The first room I was shown to was very dirty with bedding stained and hairs in the bed. The second room I moved to was just as bad with a very tired old dirty mattress which is not acceptable. The bathrooms was not clean and had a number of hairs in the bath and mouldy grout around the bath. Overall this is a very tired dirty hotel. One good experience was the service and meals in the restaurant were very good.
-2; Very disappointed with our stay. The receptionist at spa was dull and depressing, unfriendly, and more interested to file her nails than explain about the facilities!  There was no smile to welcome me in the facilities, not even hello. Seemed she was more interested in her self, than the job. Please !! I beg you! Do some staff training at reception! Otherwise- I would recommend no one to go there! Swan across is much better! 
-2;We booked a 'feature room' at this hotel online and indeed when we arrived we were told that we had got a feature room. When we were shown to our room we were excited to see that it said 'Woburn Suite' on the door - but what a disappointment! It was one of the smallest rooms we have ever stayed in - how they can call it a suite I don't know! There wasn't even space for a bedside table at the side of the bed and the door only just opened, pushing against the side of the bed. We were at the front of the building and it was very noisy from the bar/restaurant underneath. You could actually hear what people were saying. I rang reception and asked if we could move rooms due to the noise and the size of the room. I was told that the hotel was full so this wasn't possible. I was informed that most people leave the restaurant by 10pm so the noise shouldn't be a problem, this turned out to be correct and we had a good nights sleep. The breakfast in the morning was very nice and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. On checking out we were asked if everything had been ok, so we told him that we were not happy with the size of the room and asked why it was described as a feature room and a suite when clearly it was neither. He said that the head office decided how to classify the rooms but did reduce our rate from £85 for the night to £65 (which is the corporate rate).
-2;"We arrived on Friday afternoon. Our rooms were very satisfactory and the two young ladies on Reception could not have been more helpful booking us into very full restaurants for both Friday and Saturday evening. HOWEVER on Saturday things started badly and went from bad to worse. Our ordered papers failed to arrive in the morningf; when we returned to the hotel at the end of the afternoon we found not only that our rooms had been left unclosed (pulled to but not shut) but they had also not been cleaned. When we expressed concern to a member of the Reception staff that evening that as the front door of our annex was left unlocked our belongings could have been stolen we received no apology but were told no worries as the hotel had CCTV!!!. Returning at the end of the eveining we found both our room keys had been disabled. Again no apology - instead the same member of staff thrust his face in mine and pulled rude faces. In view of the review from Hazel S I should mention that there was also a wedding at the hotel on the evening in question - which of course does not excuse rudeness but may explain short staffing."
-2; Me & partner booked a weekend in London, and picked this hotel due to its location and previous reviews.  However, on arrival we were made to wait over an hour to get a room. Despite arriving an hour after the desgnated check-in time, there were no clean rooms available to accomodate us. As more people arrived hoping to check in, more were asked to wait, and it would appear that whoever shouted the loudest got a room first, despite how long they had waited for.   The hotel is suitable enough and in a fantastic location. However, the overall service was very poor. In the morning, we had 3 cleaners walk into our room on separate occasions, whilst me & partner were both sleeping. Check-out was 11am, though cleaners were attempting to get into our room from 8.30 am onwards - which as you can imagine made us feeling very uncomfortable. In the end, it was easier to get up and check out.   I wouldnt stay here again. This hotel is expensive for what it is, the decor isn't great, and the service was bad. For the same amount of money, you can easily stay in the same or similar location, in a better hotel and hopefully have a far better experience than we did. 
-2; Stayed for 2 nights with work. When you first enter the hotel you can't help but be impressed, high ceilings, large seating area, polite reception staff. However things quickly go downhill the further you go into the hotel. The lift is so tempremental, I choose to walk the impressive sweeping stair case to the 3rd floor. the further you go the more threadbare the carpet becomes, it's even held down with graffer tape in places. the corridors need some attention. My room 306, was on the small side for a double room, the furniture had seen better days, it looked clean but the bathroom window sill was black, the net curtain was black with mildew, the grout on the tiles was black. The shower had no pressure and fell apart. I reported the problems with the shower at 07.00, the receptionist was very apologetic, promised to get it fixed. when I returned at 18.00, the shower was as I'd left it in the morning, I walked back down the stairs to reception, to be informed that their wasn't anyone who could fix it, I could either move rooms or have the use of a shower in another room. I took the second option, the room was single room, it looked a lot nicer than the one I was in and the shower was much nicer. I wasn't very impressed that the hotel had failed to even get someone to even look at the shower.  Food - lunch on the first day, plates were cold and the food was luke warm. Evening meal, portions wouldn't have satisifed a 10 year old. second day I thought breakfast was OK but it was completely self service, even the coffee, which isn't what i expect from a 4 star. second evening meal, I was made to feel extremley uncomfortable, I have food alleges, the hotel had been informed of this in advance, the meal was a set menu, I had to explain to 3 different people that I had food alleges, each course my food arrived at least 5 mins after everyone elses. my starter and dessert where both fruit based, now whilst i like fruit I don't expect a 4 star hotel to lack such imagination. My main was dry, bland and boring, I could have eaten the same main as everyone else minus the gravy. They obviously can't cater for anything other than a mass market. There are plenty of other places to stay in Buxton, don't stay here. 
-2; I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while in London on a business trip. I was asked at reception is I wanted to purchase breakfast at the hotel on a special rate only available at check in, I did purchase the breakfast but would advise people staying at the hotel not to. Breakfast was of a very poor quality, you are much better off going to one of the many cafes in close vicinity to the hotel. My room was very small, but adequate. The extractor fan in my bathroom was VERY loud. I went out for dinner and was surprised to find it still on when I got back to my room. I called reception and explained the problem and asked if there was a way of turning the fan off. The reception was not interested and told me that the bathroom fans were centrally operated and kept on 24 hours a day. I said it was VERY loud and the receptionist told me it was the same in all the rooms, so not worth moving. Really? They keep the extractor fans on in all the bathrooms 24 hours a day and they are all that loud?!?! How incredibly inefficient. Needless to say it was very difficult to sleep. I won't be staying here again and would not recommend the hotel. 
-2;" A friend took me for afternoon tea for my birthday and was extremely upset and embarrassed with the whole thing. 4 very boring, hardly any filling, finger sandwiches; flat scones that completely crumbled when you cut into them; 4 tiny pieces of cake - lemon sponge, fruit cake, carrot cake and fruit & custard tart. All were hard and dry and looked like they had been shop bought. Although the restaurant was not busy, the only time anyone came to speak to us was when my friend had to get up and go to them to ask for more tea. Not once did they ask if things were ok or if we needed anything. We were so infuriated, we didn't even want to talk to them to complain!! "
-2; I am usually very good with my reviews and understanding when there are mistakes. This time though I don't want to let it go: 1) I arrived at 5 pm and asked to get a shirt ironed for the next morning. They told me it was not possible because there was nobody there that could make it. This is unacceptable in a business hotel.  2) The room smelled funny. I thought it was just my room and decided to complain at the reception, only when I got there though I realised the whole hotel smelled like that. Something like rotten fruit, very unpleasant. I was lucky the nose gets used to smells so I just had to endure for the first 5 or 6 minutes when I got in the room. Still , how bad is that?  3) The minibar was empty, not even a bottle of water for the night.  4) I pulled out the duvet on the bed to find a dried up used napkin glued to the inside face of the duvet. I figured it was washed and ironed with the linens so it is no big thing, it was sterylised, I scrapped it off and slept anyway, still... It is disgusting.  5) I went to breakfast the next morning and asked for a newspaper, there were none in the restaurant room nor outside. A pretty clumsy waitress came back with a badly folded and used copy of the Daily Telegraph. I mean, firstly who told you I read the Daily Telegraph and second why don't you just make it look nicer if you are handing it to me.   Overall, not a business standard I am afraid. 
-2; First time that I had stayed at this hotel - never again. You obviously paid for the view - £72.00 extra for room with balcony overlooking the harbour. Staff very friendly. Downside - no help with bag, room very tired and carpet could have done with a good clean together with the floor in the bathroom. Certainly not worthy of 4* - nearer to a Premier Inn. Food good - but very small portions. Walls paper thin - could hear all conversations for room next door. 
-2; I attended letchworth hall at the weekend for my brother in laws wedding. I will start with the positives...  1. There are some friendly waiting staff that work here 2. The food at the wedding breakfast was bought out promptly and all tables were served at roughly the same time (roughly 80 guests) 3. The food was nice. 4. Toiletries were of a nice quality. 5. Bottled water available in the rooms. 6. Shower was nice, our room had no problem with hot water (room 20) 7. Bed comfortable and decent size - super King I think?  Now for the downers...  1. On arrival the house looks dated, this is backed up by mismatched chairs lining the hallways. Chipped wood finishes in the bedrooms and even a dire attempt to replace some wood on the dining table in the bridal suite. 2. Bridal suite- could be lovely, but again gloomy in decor, damaged wood around the sinks in the bathroom. Despite being promised this room for the bride to get ready in with her bridesmaids and for photos getting ready, the room was not available until 2ish in the afternoon, by then it was to late and the opportunity gone. The bride instead had to hijack one of her guests room. In addition, owing to the bridal suite being unavailable, the filmographies and photographer instead used our room to store/charge stuff, which meant the process of myself, my husband (best man), a bridesmaid and my son getting ready was disjointed at obviously people were coming and going. 3. The food, although nice, is overpriced. 4. Corkage fee of £10! Offering more reasonably priced wine on the menu, would allow people to not feel so fleeced! 5. The buffet food in the evening was taken away after about 1 hour of being out! Lots of food was wasted and even worse - many guests were left hungry because of food being removed. 6. There was a problem with the audio equipment which only got sorted once the best man sorted it out. Staff were both dismissive and unhelpful with this. 7. Rooms over-priced for the quality of the rooms themselves. 8. Staff young with some being trained for silver service on the day of the event which meant there was a lot of pressure on said staff and lots of food being dropped! 9. Management were rude to customers (overhearing a complaint being handled by a manager - the manager stated that if the customer continued he would throw him out of the hotel!) 10. Using the adjoining health centre/swimming facilities - we arrived at the hotel at 5, and were at the swimming pool at 5.30pm. Enroute, the receptionist even gave us some towels. We arrived only to be told that children could only swim between 12 and 5. No mention of this at the hotel, by the receptionist who gave us the towels, and I don't think any mention on the hotels website. I spoke to the manager at the swimming pool and she said that this was a frequent problem with the hotel and that they were often having to inform guests about this who arrived expecting to swim with there children. I spoke to the receptionist back at the hotel about what had happened and she said she was not aware of this. 12. Dirty chair outside our bedroom window for the duration of our stay (2 nights?) 13. Wedding suite had no hot water?!? Staff informed, a look of confusion and a comment about switching on the boilers again... 14. The children's play equipment is old - metal frames etc...  I know the bride is going to be complaining to the hotel about what had happened, I can only hope that they offer some type of reasonable compensation and seriously consider all points that she and myself raise, I will up date you on the outcome of this.  Personally, as it stands - the venue, although offering the benefit of having everything virtually in the same building does not offer the wow factor experience that you would expect for a wedding. I would not recommend unless they seriously address some of the points I have raised in here.   I will be forwarding to the hotel themselves - it will be interesting what they say in response - again i will post there response. 
-2; Booked a hen do for 8 of us through spabookings.com. When we arrive we were told our rooms had been cancelled. Half an hour later this was resolved. Spa treatments had been double booked and staff unable to re arrange our treatments. Half the party had to rush in (with their luggage) so they didn't miss treatments. Not exactly relaxing. Although the spa staff apologised, the hotel manager was extremely rude. There was no explanation for the mix up and NO apology from the manager! Food was delicious and waiting staff were very attentive but I would not stay again. 
-2; Overnight stay. Advertised as the best hotel in Bournemouth. Found this on secret escapes and now know why they are secret the food is probably the worst food I have eaten and this a a four star hotel and we ordered from the alcarte menu. Poole sole was not fresh and not cooked still pink in the middle it smelt of fish and not the sea, new potatoes drowning in butter and brown where they had been reheated a large skinned tomato and mushroom. We complained returned fish off the bone now with only half a mushroom awful. I then had cheese and biscuits thought safe to do this... Grapes thrown on the plate celery all stringy no love shown by this chef. Out of interest just read another review same night that person had great food at a Xmas party... This may explain what happened chef on that service and a stand in cook???? Doing us!  The hotel facilities good room clean but tired old need of updating shower rusty look roll holder broken but clean, situated in a good location. Service overall OK reception busy only one person had to wait, clearing plates from table waited 35 minutes for this to happen had to ask one of the six staff to remove them. Breakfast OK had to ask for milk and flora... Hard to believe 4 stars! 
-2; I booked a single room, so expected a small space, which was fine - compact but not too bad for one night. However, the room was as hot as an oven, so I turned the radiator off, but this resulted in the heating system constantly clicking to try to override the radiator. This was difficult to ignore when trying to sleep, but eventually I managed it. However, I was woken up at 04.45 by the laundry delivery guys who banged van doors, rattled cages about and generally made enough noise to fully awaken me (even though I was on the 5th floor). After managing to overcome the clicking radiator noise again, I was then woken up again at 06.00 by the noise of the shower and extractor fan from the room next door. I gave up on the idea of sleep and decided to get up myself and found that none of the lights in my room were working. After getting dressed via the bathroom light I managed to get a staff member to have a look and apparently the room is 'wired funny' and you have to click the various switches on and off in a random manner to turn the lights back on again (!). All in all, staff were kind of friendly, but the point of getting a hotel room is to sleep and I didn't manage that at all. 
-2; Just checked in, staff at reception very welcoming.  Room not anywhere near a good standard. Tired room,bathroom shower curtain has mold on it, shower tubing disgustingly dirty. Telephone filthy.  Not impressed. £45 would be way too much to pay, never mind over £100.  I will be looking for breakfast elsewhere in the morning, & would not consider returning. 
-2; I was given a voucher for Afternoon Tea for my birthday because I do love a good afternoon tea but unfortunately this wasn't one of them.   Where we sat had no atmosphere what so ever in fact we were the only two people in there and there wasn't even any music playing. The food was nothing like what I have had before in other places, extremely limited on what we got, sandwiches were ok, the cakes were tiny and only one of each so we had to cut them in half for us both try them, one mouthful and it gone, only one scone each, which in my view is the best part of an afternoon tea!   The staff were friendly enough but nothing special. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. 
-2; Went just for the half day for a spa.....which included use of the facilities. If you are looking for a relaxing day, this is not the place to find it. The pool is available for all guests, not just those using the spa, and children are very noisy. I was not even informed that steam room was not working on that day. The only other facility was sauna. Other disapoint was service. There is water machine by the pool, but no cups. I asked spa reception lady to bring some in, but she never did, so went thirsty rest of the day. All in all this was a disappointing experience. 
-2;Just back from a winter remedy weekend at Hoar Cross Hall at a cost of £220 per person. We have stayed many times before and regard it as an indulgent treat. How disappointed we were. From treatments being incorrectly booked to having to find someone to seat us for breakfast we felt rushed and far from pampered. Lunch was a huge disappointment. Despite being told on arrival it would be served in the ballroom we overheard another party saying it had been moved to a function room. It felt as though it had been thrown together, piles of dirty table linen in the corner and a poor selection of luke warm food unappetisingly presented made it feel more like a staff canteen. The personal touches seem to have been sacrificed for the extensive renovations As we were unable to check in until 2pm (unless we paid a further £40 per person) we had little over 24 hours at the hotel and having paid a total of £880 for 4 of us we came away feeling we had poor value for money and sadly are unlikely to return.
-2; Having rang the hotel twice to confirm the booking of our VIP to ensure there were no extra charges and that I was more than organised would you believe they charged our VIP £25 on arrival. What a lovely welcome. Thank you very much Sandman hotel for ruining my perfectly laid out plans. Luckily enough this was our trial run for a much bigger occasion and we will obviously be more than happy to book elsewhere. There are loads of other hotels in the area pick wisely! 
-2;" On the hotels website this looked like a lovely hotel with really modern nice rooms so although we did think it was expensive for a 3 star hotel we decided to stay here. We could only book a &quot;suite&quot; for £150.00 as all the other rooms were booked so we stayed in &quot;The Angel Suite&quot; BUT this was definitely not a suite. It was a small bedroom with an equally small double bed the mattress was really uncomfortable I presume they decided to call it a suite because there was a tiny little room joined on to it with two old dirty chairs and a telly on the wall and a fire escape sticking halfway into the room. The whole room was one big disappointment it was really scruffy the bathroom was dirty with mould round the bath and on the tiles I tried to have a shower only to find the shower hose had holes in it so the water literally sprayed everywhere, the whole place needed a really good scrub and decorating. This was such a shame because we ate in the restaurant at night and the breakfast the next day was really nice also the décor of the bar and restaurant was lovely the staff were really friendly and welcoming. I can't understand why they can't adapt the rooms to match or at least not charge so much!! "
-2; My brother and sister in law stayed at the Crown Plaza on Saturday night - we visited them for dinner and ate in the bar. It took 20 minutes for somebody to come over and take our order as part of the order we asked for 3 veggie burgers, it took 15 minutes for the waiter to come back and tell us they were out of veggie burgers and were then unable to offer us an alternative, we ended up ordering pasta along with a couple of other dishes. It was a further 50 minutes before the food arrived and it was very disappointing. Earlier in the day my sister in law took her 2 children for a swim, she said that unfortunately the pool temperature was too cold for the children. All in all with young children this hotel appears to maybe be more for business use rather than a family break. 
-2;" I was pretty dissapointed with this marriott, after staying in many all over the country i have quite grown to like the marriott brand and would always choose them over another 4 star hotel in the places i visit.  The good: The location of the hotel is brilliant right in the centre, 5 minutes walk to the shops and liverpool one. The car park is joined on to the hotel although it shows a charge of about £18 a day the hotel validates your ticket and its only £12 per day. The rooms were very nice, clean, nice large new lcd tv, great service for dinner the waiter was so helpful and friendly. Breakfast was probably one of the nicest i've had, good quality sausage and bacon, eggs being cooked to order, plenty of pastries and fruit to choose from, table service tea and coffee brought very quickly.  The Bad: We arrived at 3pm to be told the room was just being finished off and if we went into the bar someone would let us know asap. We sat until 3.55pm and my boyfriend went and asked them how long it was going to be and they gave us our keys straight away which made me think how long had the room been ready for? was this just a trick to get you to spend money in the bar? Anywasy we got into the room and it was freezing the maid had put the air con on, not a great idea when its raining outside. The heating wouldnt work, the room didnt seem to warm up so we rang reception who told us they send someone up to fix it or with a heater for us... im still waiting! The hotel leisure facilities were pretty poor, the decor and fittings were very old and worn. The pool was freezing, the changing rooms were very dated with shower curtains for cubicles to get changed in, only 2 showers. The steam room was tiles missing, silicone hanging of the tiles in strips of about 10cms and the tiles were very grubby and mouldy. The evening meal was awful we both choose steak & ale pie with mash, the pie tasted microwaved it was very soggy, pastry inside was uncooked, very chemicaly taste i think it was bought in. The dessert wasnt anything special either. The rooms were lovely and clean but the sound proofing was a joke, i could hear people opening their wardrobes, we heard a couple getting &quot;frisky&quot;, their was a function in the restaurant on saturday night and the music could be heard all over the hotel and people coming home at 3am shouting along the corridors woke me up. The window in the room seemed to be open slightly and their was a draft and i could hear noise from outside aswell. The bed covers didnt seem to fit the duvet, their was a big gap and we seemed to be sleeping on the bare duvet.   All in all i wouldnt recommend this hotel, and i wouldnt visit again. It wasnt awful but i was quite dissapointed for a 4 star hotel. It was my least favourite marriott i've stayed in. "
-2; We stayed in December in a queen size room with a view. The bed was smaller than a normal double and our view was of next rooms window and a wall. The air con didn't work so the room was stuck at 28degrees all night and the bathroom fab did not turn off. We managed about 2 hours sleep. Really sad as we had gotten engaged that night and wanted to make it special, instead we were both really hot and grumpy by the time we left in the morning. Only positive is the lovely staff- we had a couple of drinks in the bar and the bar man was fantastic. I would never stay in a Hilton again as we did not get what we paid for and would suggest staying in one of the hotels at the top of Hyde park which were beautiful- we had dinner in the Grosvener and it was fantastic, would rather have paid the extra and stayed there! 
-2;" I’m not a frequent reviewer of the breaks and stays I go on, so this maybe one of the first I've felt so passionately about reviewing.   I will start off with the goodish points.  I booked the Overnight Reviver spa package (£140pp) for 4 friends as a girly overnight stay for a friends Birthday. I also read loads of reviews on the site before making my decision and realised that this hotel had the best reviews.  I booked the package directly from the Rowhill Grange Hotel staff and dealt with Danielle a member of the bookings team.   We arrived at the hotel and found the scenery absolutely beautiful and there was a Wedding going on, so my friends and I really enjoyed dreaming over the braids dress. Lets just say it put us in a good mood.  Check in wasn't overly smooth, but nothing for us to really complain about.  My friend (the Birthday Girl) did overhear a staff member (funny enough the porter) saying that he didn't carry bags, (referring to our bags) but quickly offered to, when he noticed his colleague holding the bags of other the guests. Yes how rude!!  Our rooms were beautiful and very comfortable and had really cool names, like Narcissus. My only compliant about the rooms was that, our room was very dark, which we later found out was due to a missing lamp, and the shower was actually unusable due to it being too hot. I mean it was boiling!!. But in saying that, we slept really well and spent most of the time in the Birthday girl’s room anyway, which was lovely! But thank god we had that option,  We had lunch at the Elements Bar and Lounge, and loved the staff there. They were very attentive and friendly. The food was also very nice (no complaints from our table) but just be warned, it’s quite expensive. Also I was on antibiotics during my stay and the staff at Elements kindly allowed me to stall my medicine in their fridge, which was very lovely of them.   The spa is actually smaller then it looks in the images, so don’t expect a grand entrance, but again can't complain, as it was all very enjoyable. It wasn't very busy when we were there which was nice, but I can imagine it being very tight if it became busy. The changing rooms are also quiet small and there's no real area to sit and relax with friends.  The 25min treatments were also very nice. I had the reflexology, which the Spa team kindly changed over from a back massage due to my jaw pain, and my friends had back massages (which they loved) and an express pedicure. My friend did said that the express pedicure was not really worth getting as she felt it didn't really make a difference and it was REALLY expressed with little care....  By the way, the Spa staff were also very pleasant and there was a particular lady that showed us around, who should really give lessons to some of the other staff members of the hotel including the manager on customer service.  We really enjoyed the food and loved the restaurant staff. But let me clear this £30 voucher up. &quot;you will AWALYS spend over £30 for your dinner &quot;The voucher will only get you some starters & some mains and including a service charge on top of that of about £5 - £9, that’s already over £30. You will not be able to purchase any drinks with the voucher and the staff will ask you over 100 times if you would like wine, as I’m sure they expect a certain amount ££ from each table. So if you’re on a budget please take note. But in saying that, the food in my opinion was worth the spend, but it would of been nice for this to have been clarified in advance. You will need to budget at least £100- £150 for a table of 4 for wine, starters, mains and deserts, but that’s only if you want to spend that.  We also had Breakfast at the same restaurant and had no complaints here. This was probably the most fun we had at the hotel, as we had quiet time to talk and eat. They did get my breakfast order wrong, but quickly rectified it with no problem.  So with all the good reviews, what’s with the title and rating you ask? Well I was told during my booking that we would receive included with the package, 1 breakfast, 1 lunch and 1 dinner worth £30 and obviously this was incorrect as for the entire stay we were given the run around. I was also told by the &quot;general manager&quot; (and I quote) &quot;Danielle&quot; (the staff member who booked our trip) was an experienced staff member, so couldn't of got this wrong, after which the manger tried to offer us the lunch at an expense, in which we happily declined. I must admit I found him quiet insulting, considering we were customers. The funny thing is, I went back and forth with the sales staff so many times making sure everything would be easy on the stay, as I knew I wouldn't be very well around the time of our stay and it was also a friends birthday, so this was VERY disappointing. I even asked her to let the receptionist know it was a Birthday group and if they could show some sort of acknowledgement, even if it was verbal, for which I was told a note would be made on our booking, well no surprises, that also did not happen! I have since emailed the &quot;sales staff&quot; in question and have had no response. Not very surprised really… I must say this was the worst customer service I've ever experienced and to be quite honest, I couldn’t wait to get out of there, which was such a shame. To conclude this review, I didn't really want to rubbish the hotel, as it wasn't rubbish. But as I said in the title &quot;its a shame about some staff&quot; My advice is, if you book with this hotel directly, make sure you do everything via email and get everything confirmed in writing, just so you know exactly what your getting and have evidence when the general manager tells you different. Also please remember that one of their &quot;porters&quot; doesn’t hold bags and they will not acknowledge your Birthday unless you buy a cake and speak with the lovely restaurant staff yourself. I will not be staying here again. But I'm sure you all will enjoy it If you choose to. Well I hope so!!!! "
-2;After paying for my daughter and 2 friends to celebrate the end of exams I was extremely disappointed. We booked a spa day with lunch and facial. The spa is nowhere near the pool, or the restaurant , or any decent coffee. I felt uncomfortable wearing a dressing gown, with no make up and messed up hair in front of so many golfers and day guests. I hoped the spa would have been more contained. The facial was adequate but the lunch was awful. Not enough selection and looked totally unappetising. The cost of 3 spritzers and a water was £30. The pool was dirty and cold and lacked enough sun loungers for the handful of people there. The rest room was fine and the spa staff were obliging - however I won't be rushing back!
-2; We choose to stay here before our flight room was well presented but that was all i can say we had a horrible noise coming from room we called reception and was told it was kitchen fans!! They did offer to move us but said fan should stop around 11,it didnt!! Didnt get much sleep as we had to leave early morning restaurant very ovepriced!!! 
-2; For me, the crucial thing about any good overnight stay is a good night's sleep. However, at The Churchill Hotel, this is highly unlikely. I stayed there this week with my boyfriend and we were really disappointed. The mattress was completely shot, and neither of us slept well due to mattress springs poking into our ribs. The pillows were lumpy and old too, so there was nothing to use to make the bed comfier. The room was incredibly hot as well, even with the climate control set to minimum and the window was painted shut.  We definitely wouldn't stay there again. If you want a hotel in this area, try The Grange just across the road! 
-2; We went to this place as I thought I had found a marvellous Groupon offer, £99 for B&B and dinner for two. On checking in, our hearts already sank upon spotting a huge wedding party. Our fears were realised when the constant thumping of the music kept us awake until 1h30. When I phoned reception at midnight to ask when the party would be over, I was told that our room was far enough from the party room that I should not be able to hear the music. I invited the man to come over and listen for himself and explained that I am usually not in the habit of calling to complain that something I cannot hear is keeping me awake.   The room itself was small, old fashioned and dusky and the bed small and uncomfortable. The bathroom was tiny and in need of a good scrub. The whole thing felt depressing and we left immediately after dumping our bags and drove into town. We returned to make use of our dinner part of the deal. What the deal hadn’t stated (not even in the small print), was that there was a maximum value ceiling, i.e. we could only eat for £25 a head, the rest we would have to pay for ourselves. So unless you opt for the cheapest meals on the menu, or keep to two courses, expect to pay extra. The wine prices were extortionate. The cheapest glass of wine was, if memory serves me correctly, around £7. The food wasn’t bad, but much too overpriced and it arrived within minutes, which smacked of mass production.   By the time we paid for all the extras, we would have been much better off staying in a cosy B&B and eating in a local restaurant somewhere. In fact, I think I would have been happier in a Travellodge, where you at least get what you pay for. 
-2; We stayed overnight on Friday 18th. October. The stay was a gift from our family for our Golden Wedding Anniversary, the castle itself is very impressive but the evening meal in the restaurant was a BIG disappointment, three courses for £25 was a rip-off, my first course consisted of three halves of cherry tomato with a few slivers of mackeral, main course, half a breast of poached chicken sitting on top of a small mound of mashed potato (and I mean small) with two slivers of carrot ( I didn't fancy the roast liver that was also part of the meal but I can't imagine that there would have been much of that!) The dessert was delicious but not enough to fill us so both my husband and myself left the table still feeling hungry, the only saving grace was the breakfast the following morning which we both enjoyed and I'm glad to say there was plenty! 
-2; My partner and I stayed the night here as a mid way break on our way up to Cumbria. After a long drive, we looked forward to a night of luxury. The room was very nice but the tv in a corrider facing the window so you would have had to move the tv to watch it. It was on a very heavy wooden cabinet with no wheels. We were told the room was on the ground floor which I was pleased with as I am on crutches, there was no mention of the stairs to get to the room. Went to the restaurant for dinner and asked for gin and tonics asked for bombay saphire gin as it is our favourite and on there cocktail list they did a cocktail made with bombay saphire, we were told they didn't sell it.....wonder what was in the cocktails?? 20 minutes later we were still waiting, when asked where the drinks were the waitress disappeared for another 5 minutes to apologise and say they had run out of gin, this was at 7.15 in the evening (I did have a vision of someone going off to Tesco) and had gone to get some more. Eventually the gin and tonic appearedbuth it was all in the same glass, we sent them back and asked for the tonic to be brought seperately. Other tables in the dining room were being offered bread rolls, but we had to ask for bread, there was no salt and pepper on any off the tables, by the time I realised there was no butter I didn't have the nerve to ask for some. Saying all this the food was fabulous. Went to bed and was woken up by a generater lorry parked outside our window running for 30 mins then trolleys and crashing and banging, this was about 7am. Breakfast arrived in the room on time but cold. We had toast and marmalade but no plates or clean knives to put them on. Then for me the last straw was the shower, the water was either lukewarm or cold. I wrote a 4 pages of complaints and gave them to the reception when we were checking out. I felt They got the deputy manager to come and see us, he seemed very nice and agreed that our complaints were valied he said he wanted to prove to us that this was not how it normally is and said he would discuss with the operations manager and write to us with an offer. We at this point were happy as we felt that we had been listened to etc and what was meant to be a lovely evening in 4 star luxury was not that. Since we got home it has now been over 2 weeks I have heard nothing, I expected there to be a letter waiting when we got home or within the week. I was prepared to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt but the delay in hearing from them, if I ever will, just tells me that they are not prepared to listen to constructive critiscm which was done in a polite and discreet manner, also they do not follow through on what they promise. 
-2;"Malmaison continues to disappoint.  We stayed at the Reading hotel over Valentines weekend after receiving a voucher for our wedding, after staying at their London hotel last year and being very disappointed with the overall service this was a great opportunity to hopefully have a great experience. Sadly this was not the case.  Check-in was very mechanical with no offer of dinner or suggestions on where to go for dinner. Keys handed to us as if we knew where all the facilities were.   We had booked a Valentines dinner but after checking out the restaurant and bar, we decided that there was better value for money to be had and hopefully friendlier service.  Cancelled the table and got a &quot;fine&quot; as an answer.  Checked out on Monday to no &quot;thank you&quot; or even a &quot;safe journey&quot;   It's a shame that this brand has become an over-priced, forgettable experience."
-2; My friend and I booked a single and a twin room from the 4th to the 6th of August. We paid £80 for the single room for two nights and £120 for the twin. My twin room was basic, the beds were clean but the bathroom had A LOT of mould which made the whole room smell awful! This was due to there not being a working extractor fan. Also, the shower door was cracked. The kitchenette was not equipped, if we have had wanted to prepare meals. There was no knives, only one bowl which was dirty and no plates. I complained on the first night about the freezer as it was packed with ice and other guests ice lollies! This was not dealt during the rest of stay. We were not supplied with a hair dryer as specified on the website. The T.V. did not work in the single room, we complained about it on the first day and it was fixed later on the second day. The kettle did not work either and was never fixed even though we complained. Overall, we did not particularly enjoy our stay and would not recommend this to anyone. We felt that we had paid far too much for what we received. 
-2; Lovely grounds and beautiful drive down to Hotel but what a disappointed, problems with parking, the room was so far away from dinning room, nice polite reception staff but stopped there, Room dusty, found hair in bathroom, blood stained bed sheet, returned three lipstick marked drinking glasses, everywhere you looked it needed a clean, tables dirty, full of empty glasses. I think its all down to poor management, lack of training. A lovely hotel but not being looked after. 
-2; We had read previous poor reviews and decided we would give the swan a chance to be better than them. We so wanted it to be good. However we were disappointed, the setting is idyllic and should give the diner an amazing experience . It didn't help that the gates were being painted right next to the outdoor dining area on the first really warm day of the summer, so the smell of paint does not help. The food was generally ok but the service was poor. The staff who attended our table struggled with English . We had had our main course and decided to order some puddings and coffee. We asked for the coffee to come after the puddings but they came before and in fact we'd drunk them by the time the puddings arrived. Sorry but we would not return 
-2; I had purchased a Groupon voucher for a night for two at the Thistle back in early December. The voucher stated I could use it on a Friday night anytime up until 31st Jan except for Christmas and New Year. However when I came to try and book for either December or January none of the dates we wanted were available. Apparently only 25% of capacity is set aside for Groupon offers (not something mentioned on the original offer). Looking on their website we would have been better off with one of the hotel's own offers which were not limited to dates/capacity (last time I use Groupon). Eventually we booked the only Friday available on the offer which was not a date we really wanted. When complaining to the member of staff on the phone he said he would give us an upgraded 'family' room as we were unhappy with the dates etc. We had to accept and arriving we were glad of the larger room which would have been pretty cramped for a family. The decor and fixtures were tired and dated and our view was of the council building but we hadn't really expected more. The night was noisy so we stayed in bed in the morning knowing that breakfast went on until 10.30am. However getting down at 10am we found that despite being a buffet breakfast there was a queue for tables. Most of the tables were on the level looking out at the sea which we had looked forward to. As we had to wait 15mins for a table we took the first available down by the bar. Our planned relaxed breakfast became a marathon as we had plans that we were then running late for. At check-out we were told we had a £30 supplement to pay for for the 'family' room. Seems the guy I booked with had made no mention on the system that he had offered us the upgrade. I made it very clear that we would not be paying a penny more for our stay. On the plus side the staff were all very friendly and helpful, but we will not be going back and we cannot recommend this hotel. Beware of Groupon offers, check to see hotels own offers and the Groupon limitations not stated. 
-2; I paid in full when I booked in, and was then not able to add anything on my room which caused a little embarrassment when trying to add to my bill for snacks in the bar. It was possible to get hot toast due to the toaster being slow and the amount of people trying to get toast, my breakfast was cold when I finally got the toast there was only one crisp egg left on the help yourself breakfast. The room was the not the standard one and although spacious the damp ran down the side of the window. The room was not really cleaned properly, and no bath mat was left on the second day. There was no mirror above the dressing table so to dry my hair I had to stand next to the long mirror by the wardrobe. Positive - the coffee at breakfast was good, staff were reasonably helpful 
-2; I just found this hotel overpriced and uncaring. Arriving on the Friday we had to go to the pub next door to get the key to our room. We were taken to the room but the young girl had no knowledge of the room or how the facilities worked. She told us the room would be cleaned and replenished each day. On returning Saturday evening the bed had been made, the dirty towels were hung on the back of the bathroom door to be reused and the water bottles had not been replenished. Reception desk was always empty and if you need anything you had to ring a number, providing you had a phone. There was no phone in the room. The room was small for the price we were charged. The lighting was inadequate and could have done with a couple of lamps on the dressing table and near the coffee making facilities. The 'Boutique' atmosphere masked the facilities you would normally find in a room of this price. The hanging robe was just a couple of scaffolding poles and a reclaimed piece of wood, there was no drawer facilities for anything that wouldn't hang.The good point was that the bed was comfy.Overall I would have been quite happy if the room had been half the price they charged. 
-2; Four of us went here for lunch on Bank holiday Monday. I thought it was over priced, food very disappointing and service poor. After ok first course, we waited and waited and waited for our mains. One of our group got up to find a member of the waiting staff ( non in sight) to complain how long we had waited. it took about 45 minutes to bring our main out. I ordered steak that was tepid and my peppercorn sauce was the same. Everything we ordered had a supplement of £3, so why not just say the price in the first place! The steak was ordinary. The only thing on my plate that was hot were the chips, and these were good. The other three in our party all had lamb cutlets and they were only luke warm. We ran out of wine and it took 15 minutes before a member of staff asked if we wanted another bottle. Let me assure you there was no one in the room to ask!! Two of our party had desert of baked apple and it was hard. For a fine dining meal it was very poor and the staff need a kick up the rear. When we paid for the bill we were finishing off tea and drinks and not one member of staff was there to say goodbye. A man ran to the door to say had everything been ok, and not a clue who he was as we had not seen him through out our meal. 
-2; Booked at this hotel for the bank holiday weekend and I must say what a disappointed stay it was. I wouldn't pay £100 per night for this hotel. You better off booking a deluxe room/sea view room at a nearby guesthouse/bed& breakfast accommodation. I thought I'd pay a bit more for a 4 star hotel so me and my husband can enjoy the 2- day break but it was a let down. We arrived after a 6 hour drive and it would have been nice to be checked in by a smiling receptionist . From then on, my impression of the hotel just completely went downhill ! 
-2; My boyfriend and I decided to stay at a local hotel in the area as we were celebrating our anniversary and going to watch a play at the RSC.  Cons: After we shed out in excess £130 for one night we expected better. We had to pay an additional £5 parking which wasn't included in the price. We wanted to use the trouser press for our evening clothes which didn't work. When we called reception, the lady told us that spit was broken and couldn't be fixed and told us we would have to make do with an iron. This would be fine, but the room was so small the ironing board could barely fit in. The room and building in General was very dated, and could have done with a lick of paint. There was also a loud hen party going on and loud music outside our room.Although the last two comments weren't in their control, it could have still been more contained.  Pros: the location wads great, really central to everything and the play was fantastic! The hotel was very clean.   We were expecting something much better as it was 4 star. 
-2;"This hotel could be good - unfortunately they staff it with people who are quite challenged. Simple requests become complicated and &quot;complicated&quot; requests belong in another hotel.   On the positive, the location is great and facilities ok."
-2; Receptionists were rude and condescending. Only the younger staff receptionist was friendly and helpful. Doesn't normally bother me but after a 23 hour flight from Australia, it would have been nice not to have someone rude checking you in. Room clean and beds comfy and very central to Euston station. 
-2; Advised at 1 am that there was a 24hr shuttle service, called again at 2 am to be advised that there wasn't and had to walk to hotel, poor show Hilton. Complained, the response was the customer service line diverts to America so its not there fault... 
-2; A group of us stayed to celebrate a family birthday. The weather and location were faultless unfortunately the same cannot be said for the service we received. The lack of organisation and general customer service are poor. The head barman unhelpful they ran out of lemonade and although surrounded by other hotels pubs and a small supermarket did not attempt to purchase any. All of the breakfast orders were wrong and served at different times and to top it off we had booked 6 rooms and received confirmation of this however when we went to check in we were only allocated 5 rooms asthey had released 1 of our rooms. Also the rooms are small and not cleaned to a high standard. I would advise staying elsewhere in the area which is charming. I would not recommend staying here unless there is a vast improvement. 
-2; Stayed two nights on a spa break prior to a cruise. Never again. The spa treatments were good, and the rooms were fine, and thats were it ends. The spa ran out of robes, the bar/restaurant food was average, and the service was very poor. The sauna and steam rooms are tiny. They had a few groups in and the facilities just weren't big enough to accommodate everyone. The safe broke and the staff were reluctant to help, as i felt they thought we had forgotten the code, which we hadn't. After an argument they finally came up and opened it. We asked for three feather pillows and they could only find two! After more bad service we went to see the night manager, who told us she was busy and to take a seat. She then walked off and got in the lift. So we gave up. The Wifi didn't work well either. 
-2; We picked Wroxall because it had leisure facilites and a resturant in a rural setting. Unfortunately the leisure facilities really let it down. The jacuzzi was cold - barely any warmer than the pool. The pool was much smaller in reality than the pictures, and the steam room didn't work at all. The sauna worked - for about five minutes and then kept tripping out. We had to interupt the spa therapist, who then flipped the trip switch for it all to work - but only for a few minutes at a time. We came away to relax and I found myself really frustrated and disappointed. When we complained we were offered a day pass to come back and use the leisure facilities (once they've been fixed), but other than a sauna & steam room, there wasn't anything else.  The food in the resturant was lovely however. The waiting staff were very pleasant-, but seemed inexperience (they messed up our wine, didn't come back with requested sauces etc), but the food was very good (if a little pricey).  Such a shame. The hotel is a little tired, but has a charming feel. Disappointed. 
-2; We stayed here at the beginning of the year and had a brilliant time but this wasn't our experience this time. We wish we hadn't gone back and spoilt the memory! We weren't upgraded to a better room as implied on the deal. Our package included a bottle of wine in the room but when we got to our room we only had one chair (this is standard apparently) so one of use had to drink our wine standing up. We feel the hotel are only interested in weddings and big parties. The food wasn't brilliant and we weren't made to feel so welcome. 
-2; We arrived at The Caesar Hotel following a 4 night stay at the sister hotel, The Banke in Paris. The Banke was everything it promised, stylish, unusual, beautiful, spacious. A real gem of a boutique hotel. We had a great room and heaps of space and the most amazing meal in the restaurant.  We therefore hoped that our experience at the Caesar would be comparable. it was not. Whilst we had a deluxe room, it was all very cramped and I felt claustrophobic. Small windows didn't help the feeling of lack of space and the noise throughout the hotel ALL night was horrendous. I did not sleep at all. There was a group of men chatting loudly and lots of walking about on very un-sound proofed floors.  Breakfast was OK but for £179 for the night, I was not impressed and whilst we mentioned the noise and reception apologised this did not change the fact that we had not slept and no recompense was offered.  Can't recommend this one I'm afraid. Save your money and go the The Banke. 
-2; I've stayed at Brooklands before and thought it was ok, and using the Fast and Fabulous spa break makes it pretty good value so although it wasn't the complete 5* experience I thought at that price it was a good place to stay and met my requirements for a break from job and kids! Went back this Friday though and it was just not good enough and I won't be going back.   Started on the wrong foot when the hotel called to confirm my reservation and said my rate didn't include breakfast even though I booked the B&B rate and my confirmation email clearly confirmed B&B. They did change it though without too much hassle.   Spa staff are dreadful, didn't even welcome me when I arrived, no one offered me a drink and then they double-charged me for my treatment on my final bill! Definitely not worth it - the treatments are reasonable but I get better service at my local health club for half the price.   Even worse there was a large event on Friday night and the noise in my room was unbelievable, thumping bass incredibly loud. When I complained the girls at the desk said it would get better later when they closed the doors, although I couldn't really see how as my room was directly above it so the doors seemed unlikely to make much difference. Thankfully the manager then arrived and arranged for me to move rooms. I got a free upgrade which was appreciated but as I was on my own it didn't really add much to my stay and I'd much rather my original room had been peaceful! Really not on to host loud events if they cause that level of disruption to hotel guests.   Also parking has become a real problem, when I arrived there were no spaces and I had to park in the (un-surfaced) staff car park and carry my bags all the way into the hotel. Staff just don't seem to get it and hotel experience really poor this time. I'll be having my spa breaks elsewhere from now on! 
-2;We were recommended this hotel on high standards, we were very disappointed with certain aspects of our stay. We have stayed in lots of 4 star hotels around the country, this was the first time in a Puma Hotel.  We would not say this was 4 Star standard, our room was very dated and the bathroom had a lot to be desired. There were hair in the bath, it looked like it had had a cheap revamp and the water pressure from the shower was dreadful, it took me an age to wash my hair.  On arrival at the restaurant we were seated our drinks order was taken after 10 minutes along with our menu choice, we then had to wait a further 55 minutes before our starter arrived. We as were other guests sat with dirty plates in front of us for longer than we require acceptable.  At breakfast, we were stood waiting 20 minutes before we were allocated a table, then at the buffet there was a further queue as the buffet table was empty, we had to wait for the food to be cooked.  The hotel was obviously very short staffed this weekend which showed in the quality of the food and service. The staff that did attend to us where very nice and friendly but I'm afraid it was too little too late.  We very rarely have to write a bad review but ion this occasion it was avoidable, we would find it hard to book into a Puma Hotel again. Sorry.  
-2; Well we were very disappointed with this hotel. It started off badly because the receptionist was unwelcoming and miserable, she didn't smile once! Got to quite a large room which was nice but the windows that were closed didn't open and the windows that were open didn't close! When having a shower you had to switch the shower off half way through to let the water go down the plug hole before it flooded the bathroom, it was a very slow process! The water took ages to go down the sink's plug hole too, not nice when you're brushing your teeth!  The spa was ok as long as you're not shy! There are no individual changing rooms so you have to dress and undress in front of other guests in one small changing room. The sauna room was tiny and there was some tiles missing in the jacuzzi but the pool was quite warm.  The bar was very uncomfortable as it's just a tiny room with a bar in it. No music, no atmosphere, very awkward.  Breakfast the next morning was nice,the only complaint is that they only serve smoked bacon but otherwise there was plenty of choice and we were served quickly.  We weren't told about the refurbishment going on at the hotel when we booked but we definitely knew about it when we heard all the banging and drilling going on underneath our room!  Overall, we were very disappointed with the poor service,the poor maintenance,the unfriendliness and the horrible atmosphere at the hotel. Such a shame. 
-2; We booked the Grange for our Wedding Anniversary. When I phoned to book I advised of this and was told that the cheaper room was very small so we paid the higher rate for a double or king size room. We had a lovely evening out in York but when we went to bed late that evening we were very disappointed to realise that we didn't have a double bed, but two single beds pushed together. When we spoke to the Duty Manager about this the following morning he was very sympathetic and did refund us some money because we were misled when we booked. Nevertheless we were disappointed that what was meant to be a luxurious night away, ended up being an uncomfortable one! 
-2; First the good: we arrived a couple of hours early and our room was ready, which was great. Check in was straightforward enough. Location is fairly central with plenty to explore. Security were quick to respond when requested (see below).  Now the rest - the room is very basic. No phone in the room which was problematic for reasons which I will explain. No hairdryer so had to visit reception to request one. Got a travel hairdryer which cut out after 10 seconds :/ The main issue was room location. We stayed in a family room and in their wisdom, TL put us in a corridor with a school trip, who were tearing about the halls, banging doors and squealing at 11.30pm. No phone meant that one of us had to get dressed and visit reception to request that something be done. Security arrived 5 minutes later - impressive - and put the girls back in their rooms, and fetched the adults in charge of the group. The breakfast was passable at best, the sausages were all burned! Just not impressed at all. On check out was asked how our stay was and I pointed out that putting a school group round a family was not a good idea (duh), completely ruined our stay. Would not stay in a TL again unless there was literally no other option. Also stayed in a Premier Inn during this trip for a similar price - far better value and superior quality. 
-2; This was supposed to be a birthday surprise for my sisters birthday what a huge disappointment !  Greeted in a very off handed manner by person who appeared to be in charge, had to request table to be cleaned twice, expected afternoon tea to be presented in cups and saucer fitting for experience was presented with with 2 mugs with tea bags left in and a pot of hot water, requested that tea be changed to earl grey with tea bag in pot , but didn't receive it, waiter came to clear plates BEFORE we had finished and didn't ask if we where ready for plates to be cleared , sandwiches presented (salmon) very suspect and tasted off they where not changed or offered alternative.  I would probably get a better service and experience at my local tea shop !! 
-2; No hair conditioner, no body lotion. If you want milk to make tea or coffee, you have to call Room Service. I tried calling them over a one hour period but go no answer. Reception finally got some sent to the room, but by then we were ready to leave. Room was nice and at least they provided dressing gowns. Breakfast was nothing special and if you wanted fish then you had to pay extra. 
-2; Booked a short romantic break in a deluxe seaview room with balcony but had to change due to room being very noisy. Was offered a much smaller room with no balcony which staff insisted was of an equal value when it very obviously wasn't. Bar areas bland and dull, no atmosphere, certainly not romantic so checked out and booked into somewhere more atmospheric where we had a great time. Thank goodness for the internet! Only good point was that we got a full refund. 
-2;" First the good news - the bed seemed new and was very comfortable.  The rest - we arrived and were told the room was on the sixth floor - oh and by the way, the lifts aren't working (and don't appear to have been for a while). The room was billed as non smoking but smelt of smoke and apart from the bed everything was very tired. In the bathroom more than a third of the floor tiles were cracked and had dirt ingrained in them, grouting was missing from floor and wall tiles and the tiles in the shower cubicle had mould in the grouting and the shower &quot;spurted&quot; because the heads were blocked with calcium residue.  At breakfast the coffee was grey and the freshly cooked omelette was rubbery and inedible. Breakfast would probably have been ok if you stuck to food which came out of tins or packets and didn't need cooking - glad we didn't need to eat here the previous evening "
-2; Don't be fooled by the beautiful picture of the hotel in its hey day. The hotel is clean'ish,  we had room 11, very depressing, thank god there was a very small balcony at the window so I could sit on the cill.  Very old furniture and , TAKE YOUR OWN PILLOW, Every wall is in white anaclypta wallpaper which makes the whole place feel depressing.. the staff are all very young and no management in sight, the staff are very helpful and welcoming. The breakfast is good and plenty of it. Just a shame that a little TLC to the building, a window cleaner and a handyman this place could be a goldmine.  The area is very much bedsit land and feels a bit dodgy at night Would not go back, 
-2; We booked at the last minute with an incredible special deal and were amazed that the hotel still had vacancies.  I feel that the 'Georgian Hotel' in the description is misleading as the majority of the hotel is the normal run of the mill hotel interior. There were parts that were a little worn around the edges, but everything we saw was very clean. Unfortunately our room overlooked the car park and was noisy. We had to have the window open as the room was very hot and the a/c machine was broken, (a fact not discovered until the middle of the night)  Breakfast was disappointing as the hot food was a buffet and tasteless. Glad that our breakfast was included in the rate as would have been very disappointed if we had paid £15 pp. extra. Staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly throughout. I would not pay full price for this hotel, but it was excellent value for money with the special offer. 
-2; We have stayed at the Queens a number of times before and have been pleased with the service and accommodation we have received and please note we do look on the bright side of things as you can see from all of our reviews.   However, on this occasion we had big issues with our room(s) and some of the service. We arrived on Thursday and were put in room 111, which is on the main stairwell , looks out onto the main promenade, and is a very small poorly furnished room with an adjoining door into the next bedroom. We were able to hear all of the phone conversations of the man in the next room. The bathroom is incredibly small, with the door just missing the sink. The shower water runs onto the floor making it very slippy and the side mirror is fixed far too high for it to be used by anyone under 6 foot. Due to the fact that the radiator, although had a thermostat, was on boiling all of the time, we needed to use the air conditioning, which made an absolute noise. By midnight a combination of these things, along with the main fact that we could hear the night club music (which several other reviewers have mentioned) meant that we went downstairs to see if there was a chance of another room.We wont provide the full details of the conversation but were met with a rude and patronising night porter who said he couldn't hear the noise and seemed to be put out in helping us and was negative in finding us another room. He did however eventually find us another one.  The next room (130) was fine for that night (as we moved in at about 1am!) but we awoken at 6am by the sound of kitchen noise and trolleys being moved in and out. Also that morning we could every single footstep from the upstairs due to the very creaky floorboards. It is not an exaggeration to say this is distracting to the point of making the room un-sleepable in when anyone is moving upstairs. Then from 7pm onward the noise from downstairs, which we assume to be the kitchen, was constant until midnight. By this point it didn't seem worth complaining again given the attitude and effort the first time.   It is a great shame, as there are positives to the hotel for example the breakfast, the breakfast service and all the other staff were nice.   Wont be continuing our annual visit unless the noise problems are sorted out. 
-2; Stayed for one night (more than enough), over the weekend. We were shown to our room, which for what we paid, was totally overpriced. Very dark, as there is no overhead lighting, just a couple of side lights. Heating/air con not working. Not actually sure how it would work, as there was no radiator or vent in the room. No hot water. We were told to 'leave the shower running'. A ridiculous comment but we 'left the shower running' for 15 minutes - no sign of any hot water whatsoever. We complained and were 'upgraded' to a deluxe room, which was hardly deluxe. It was more what we would have expected for the price we paid.  Benches outside the front reception area littered with empty beer cans, bottles of wine, takeaway boxes. Carpet in the corridor filthy, with what looked suspiciously like blood. Trays with half eaten breakfasts left in random places on the floor in the corridor. Possibly left over from room service, but bearing in mind we didn't check in until 4pm, not really acceptable.  Breakfast arrangements reminded me of school dinners. Long queues to be seated and once seated, more long queues for the self service breakfast, which to be fair was not bad.  Don't be fooled by the Hilton name. This is a million miles away from the standard you would expect from this chain of hotels. Give this hotel a miss. 
-2; I booked this hotel for my friends 50th birthday treat as looked lovely on the website. I booked through a travel company. On arrival my friends room was ready but ours wasn't so we checked into her room. The room was very small and as soon as you walked in had an over powering smell of cannabis! When we looked out of the window there were some dodgy looking people rolling joints in a park not a very nice thing to look out over. We went for a look around the area and returned some hours later to see if our room was ready and to be fare our room was much better. We asked the receptionist to book us a taxi to take us to the theatre at a certain time but the taxi took ages and we kept asking where it was as we were worried we would be late for the show. To be honest I struggled to get the staff to understand me which was very frustrating. Eventually the taxi turned up but only after much asking. The following morning we had to queue for 20 mins for a table for breakfast. There was no bacon or toast ready my partner and friend waited 20 mins for theirs but I gave up. There were no small plates for the croissants and no glasses for the juice. There were a lot of staff rushing around but they weren't doing the things that needed to be done in the right places. Definitely wouldn't return. 
-2; Pool not available for bank holiday weekend -daughter and granddaughters very very disappointed. Bathroom shower rubber seal absolutely disgusting again-complained on previous visit. Limescale on shower head taps sink. Has housekeeping never heard of lime scale remover!!!! Standard of cleanliness in bathroom was very poor 
-2; On arrival the hotel looked wonderful and I was anticipating a great stay. We were told we'd be in 'The Treetops Annexe' a short walk from the main hotel. When walking in the annexe we were greeted with piles of dog food tins stacked up and possibly old garden furniture heaped on the floor, not inviting, more like the guests here are an after thought. When entering the room I was appalled. Dank and uncared for was my initial impression. When looking properly I was horrified by the state of it including mould, mildew and dirt in the bathroom, ceiling lights full of dust and dead flies and the worst was opening the bedside drawer to find someone's dirty pants and socks :( The T.V was the size of a small computer monitor and was so far away from the bed, we couldn't watch it. The cupboard labelled mini bar was empty too. We ate dinner and breakfast here and the food was nice, nothing like you'd imagine from a top chef, I think they just use his name but not his recipes. The dining room was cosy and inviting but I was taken back by the fact that they had the radio playing during the dinner service, plus we were seated practically on top of the radio so had to talk rather loudly to hear each other. I would definitely not stay here again, real shame as it was for a special occassion. I did mention the pants and socks in the room to the girl on reception and she looked suitably horrified. I hope they remove them for the next guest!! 
-2;On checking in at the hotel - a late check in had been advised to them, I was greeted by friendly cheerful reception staff. My room (1512)was a wheelchair access room - I did not ask for or require this. there were twin single beds, but the room was for single occupancy and I had book a double. The bathroom was a disabled equipped shower room, and I prefer a bath. I called reception and and was told that since the hotel was full they would be unable to offer an alternative but would change the room if I required it for the second night of my stay. Someone was sent to put the 2 singles together and they were made up as a king - why this could not have been done prior to my arrival I do not know. I did not sleep well - the bed was terribly soft. But the room was quiet. In the morning as I was dressing, it was difficult to put on make up and do my hair - the lighting in the room and the bathroom was very poor, and there was no plug to plug in my hair straightening irons that was anywhere near a mirror! I had a busy day ahead and went to breakfast. The variety of breakfast items on offer was extensive, but some of my party requested a la carte items, and these consistently were wrong. Brown toast that was requested, was served as white, and when this was queried we were told that they had run out of brown bread. Milk (cold) was already on the tables in jugs - but most of the jugs were almost empty, and when we requested more, the waiter had to go to 2 or 3 already vacated tables and find another half empty jug. Service was certainly not with a smile - and we were made to feel most unwelcome. On leaving the hotel for the business day I advised reception that I was expecting a very important package, and could they please call or text me when it arrived so that I could go back and collect it. They also told me that they would make the room change and move my belongings for me. Needless to say, they did not call me to tell me that the package had arrived, or move my belongings. When returning to the hotel for the second night, I asked if they had changed my room - they hadn't, but they did then do so (room 722). This was a normal (not disabled) room with far better lighting, and after a very hectic business day I was looking forward to settling down for the night. This proved to be difficult, because of a very noisy continuous bathroom fan. I called down to reception and the maintenance man was unable to fix it. Eventually he called someone else who was able to at least quieten the fan, and as long as the bathroom door was kept shut, I was able to fall asleep, only to be woken the next morning by the deafening sound of the traffic outside. Breakfast on the second morning was almost as chaotic as the first. My colleague (who also had issues with his room and the hotel) and I were disappointed in our stay, and advised the sympathetic member of staff as we checked out. He made note of the issues and as a gesture of goodwill cancelled the parking charges and the minimal mini bar charges we had incurred. He promised that the manager would call us to address the issues directly with us - over 24 hours later she has not contacted either one of us. All in all I could not recommend this hotel and I and my group of colleagues who use hotels in Birmingham frequently would not choose to stay at this hotel again.
-2; Sandwiches were all sorts of sizes and bread was dry,very basic, scones were lovely. Overall not impressed! We also had the posh beans on toast in the morning, it arrived and was cold, beans plonked on top of half a baguette, nothing posh about that. 
-2; Macdonald hotels were living up to the expected poor standards again. Lack of attention to detail by room service and housekeeping.  1. As an Elite member you receive a complimentary newspaper of choice. Except despite requesting the Times, I didn't! I queried at reception on the first morning, and someone found a copy for me. the second morning, still no newspaper - and they couldn't supply one. One wasn't being ordered for me, despite it being quite visible on my account. The situation was rectified for Thursday and Friday mornings but pretty poor to have got it wrong twice. Once is enough!  2. Every morning, I was expected to eat my room service breakfast with a teaspoon since no spoon was provided with which to consume a bowl of cereal. In addition, one morning I was expected to somehow eat 2 boiled eggs out of not an egg cup, but a coffee cup which wasn't stable and the eggs just rolled around in it !! (see photo below).  3. In addition, I had specified dietary requirements before arrival (health reasons) and for example, quite categorically requested margarine rather than butter, and skimmed milk on my breakfast tray... I was provided with neither for 4 mornings straight!! Clearly the hotel does not take dietary requirements seriously so if you have something like a nut allergy I would recommend staying away!!  4. The room service menu overall for evenings is really very poor and there is only a handful of items to choose from, none of which are healthy. It was an extremely limited selection unless you want to involve a sandwich.  5. If you then choose to go downstairs to the restaurant and bar, it is not a particularly nice environment. the bar is basically an indent in the main corridor, and the restaurant is really not in keeping with the grandiose nature of the entrance reception / main staircase area. It feels like an afterthought. All the decent rooms are set aside for conference space / functions (of which the one on Thursday night kept me awake as it's right next to the main staircase to bedrooms.  Overall, the main entrance and staircase are beautiful, and the gym / pool area are very nice - although not joined onto the hotel - you have to cross the hotel road. But the rest of the hotel just doesn't live up to that. A bar on the corridor - so if you're trying to pass through it to get to your room, you have people standing and blocking access. Very weird.  Check out the photos below for the random arrangement of breakfast!  Needless to say, I've cancelled next weeks reservation and am staying elsewhere! £750 quid for 4 nights is a joke with this level of service and the limited food / bar offerings. 
-2; Window of the room we stayed in was coming to the inside of the building, extremly dark and dull room, no view at all and no sunlight, did not expect that. Air conditioner broken, it was so hot we could not sleep. Paid £130 for one night in such dull room, very disappointed. The good things about this hotel: very clean, good food & nice staff serving breakfast. 
-2; I stayed at the Holiday Inn at Aylesbury, for 2 nights, Friday 12th and Saturday 13th of November, with my mum and my six year old daughter.  On Thursday 11th November, I received a phone call from the hotel, informing me that the hotel's swimming pool had suffered a fire in the changing rooms, and that it would be out of action until 5.00p.m on the Friday. The pool was the main, if not, the only reason I had booked this particular hotel. At the time I received the phone call, to cancel the stay would have meant a forfeit of the entire cost of the room. Great start - NOT.  Upon arrival, the first thing my daughter and I wanted to do after a 5 hour journey, was swim. However, even though it was 6.30p.m, well after the supposed opening time of the pool, the pool was not open. We were told that it would definitely be open in the morning.   The first thing my daughter wanted to do the following day? - Yup - go swimming. Could we? - NO - The pool was still closed.  We went out for the day and arrived back at about 5.30p.m, as the Reception desk staff had said that it would be open from 5.00p.m onwards. Guess what - it wasn't, but they said it would be imminently.  So, we went to our room and ordered Room Service for dinner, as the resaturant wasn't open. Guess what - no answer on the Room Service number for a whole hour - from 5.00p.m to 6.00p.m!!! Reception suggested we order in a pizza, so it was Domino's to the rescue. (and they forgot the potato wedges!!)  Now, I'm not sure how many, if any of the staff at this hotel have any young children, but when I asked at 6.45p.m if the pool was going to be open that evening at all, I was told that thy didn't know, but that we could go to the 'local' public pool (no idea how far away, and a freezing cold night) and they would re-imburse the cost of our swim. I was not about to drag my daughter out into the cold night air, drive to goodness knows where and endure the upheaval and wasted time that that would involve, when there should have been a perfectly good pool for use within a ten second walk from our room!!  I got my (extremely disappointed) daughter ready for bed - only to receive a call to my room from Front Desk, saying that the pool was open (7.30p.m). Not to be beaten, we went for a swim, which lasted all of 20 minutes, as my daughter was very tired by then.  Had we been told that the pool was likely to remain closed, we would not have booked the hotel, which in itself, was just like any other chain hotel - nothing special, just what you would expect from a hotel of this standard.  On a lighter note, the breakfast was amazing - but it didn't compensate. 
-2; After a five hour car drive and eight hour flight from Kenya I arrived at the hotel with my daughter, as you can appreciate extremely tired. There was no one to help with our luggage, in fact staff stood and watched us struggling to lift heavy cases inside. There was only one young lady on reception who was very efficient but not very friendly. Instead of welcoming us the first thing she said was that our room wasn't ready and we would have too wait. She asked us to carry our cases to a room ,when I asked if anyone could help she replied no.I accepted we had arrived early but I checked in etc. We were going to wait in the bar but there was no one there to serve us so we decided to go into town. On our return late afternoon there was a blonde lady and young man on reception. I explained to the lady that we had booked in earlier and our room should now be ready. She obviously couldn't understand English very well. She asked my name four times and then passed me a piece of paper to write it down. When I questioned this she told me to CALM DOWN!!! The young man , who I now know as Ashley came over and diffused the situation. I was thankful to him as it was impossible to get through to this member of staff what are needs were. After that we decided to just use the hotel to sleep and have breakfast, I didn't want to spend time and money in a place that was so unfriendly. Every morning we walked down the stairs just to be ignored by the reception staff, no hello or good morning !! The resteraunt staff and breakfast were lovely and couldn't be faulted. Having checked out yesterday we struggled down the stairs with four big suitcases and yet again there were staff around that could have helped us, two.ladies on our own.There is a big need for staff training in this hotel in fact I think the management should question whether certain individuals have the right apptitude and common sense to be working on reception. There was no sense of team work or positivity amongst the hotel staff except for the resteraunt. I will not be returning.  I suppose this will recieve the same formatted reply from the manager as I have seen in previous reviews ,which is a shame, as if these points were addressed the hotel would be much improved. 
-2;" Having stayed at Warners Nidd Hall hotel last summer, we were so impressed by the qulaity of the restaurants and the excellent service we thought we would try another. The Cricket St Thomas hotel is in a lovely location, it has obviously been recently refurbished and our room (a Contemporary Royale) was great. The food at dinner in the main restaurant (Tree Tops) can be best described as of hospital quality. Should you choose a later dinner (8.00 pm) they are shutting up and on Saturday evening there was little left in the buffet apart from veg that had been sitting around all evening. I managed to grab a side salad from the salad bar but the choice was limited. My husband ordered something from the menu, described as freshly prepared (it was not; you could see it had been under a heat lamp for some time) Breakfast is OK, although what exactly the troop of chefs are doing hanging around the buffet I don' t know because everything is prepared and heated elsewhere. On our last night we ate at Fenocchios Italian. It could have been good, if the chef had at least been trained in some Italian cookery and had tasted his offerings.  The staff do try but are young and clearly inexperienced. Compared to the young and enthusiastic staff at Nidd Hall, they are clearly floundering. The reception staff do not make eye contact (for fear that guests are going to complain?) We did not complain, there was no sign of anyone in charge.  The hotel gave the impression of being rudderless; no leadership. Restaurant staff wandered in to work with their coats at 8.00 am just as the restaurant opens for breakfast. The lady in charge of the restaurant told us off this morning for not sitting at our allocated table (although we did not know we had one!). She made us move.  The cost of 3 nights half board was £739, it was very poor value for money. We won't be back to Warners. "
-2;" How this is rated 4* is beyond me. We have stayed at better USA motels. Massive car park with only 4 disabled bays anywhere near the entrance, which are normal size so still impossible to get in/out car. Reception is large but clinical with its modern wooden staircase and reception. Pleasant lady on reception and all staff that we saw smiled and said hello. Directed to our room which was up a staircase or down the ramp and up in a lift. All really confusing as signs have been removed in anticipation of a much needed makeover. No matter what we did we ended up going down long dingy corridors into hell where signs said wet paint and no entry- but no other way to our room that we found, unless you came through the spa section turnstile and down a few steps. A total maze of endless dreary corridors that were depressing and either looked like the travelodge from hell or was being &quot;redecorated&quot;. We never saw anybody- neither guests not staff- on these dismal treks to breakfast and the place stank of paint fumes. Second morning we smelt strong cigarettes masked badly by tons of aftershave. We really felt as though we were in the depths of nowhere. Returning on second day our keys did not work so it was a long trek back to reception who just said it must have been near a mobile- nonsense as we never do this- and no apology. The room was adequate and obviously newly done but it's time baths were abolished as trying to shower in them as a disabled person is difficult and dangerous, especially with stupid shower curtains that cling to you. The bed was king size but too hard and the pillows uncomfortable. Did not get chance for the spa as I rang at least 10 times over several months to book treatments but nobody ever picked up or returned my call when I left a message. Email went unanswered. When someone did answer (sounded about 12) two weeks before our visit they said they were full, so not good at all especially as we never saw anybody going in or out of the treatment rooms!  The road into the hotel was easy to miss (the sign was not easy to see and popped up suddenly) and was full of potholes. Overall very disappointing, especially as I had booked it as a 10th anniversary surprise, as I was expecting an old hall establishment with quirky rooms not a travelodge hidden around the back. This is only 2* in my opinion not 4* especially as we were hidden away in the depths of despair. "
-2; The hotel itself was in a great location and for a midweek stay, was also great value for money considering the central location. However, I left my iPhone charger in the room (the plug sockets were so poorly located I had to climb beneath the desk to plug it in which wasn't ideal at five months pregnant) and I subsequently left the charger in the room. I immediately realised I'd left it behind so I called the hotel to ask for it to be held for me to collect, however the staff (both reception and housekeeping) claimed to have not found a charger in the room - I DEFINITELY left it there. So either the room was not cleaned properly and the next guest took it, or someone in housekeeping stole it for themselves. Not impressed - very poor and dishonest service! 
-2;" This hotel has everything going for it - a great building, bags of character, not a bad restaurant and friendly staff. The renovations that have been going on in the public spaces bode well.  As we approached our room, the corridor and door numbering etc all suggested that things had been recently done up.. but alas once the door was opened it was truly the &quot;bedroom that time forgot&quot;! Everything is incredibly tatty. It looks like there has been some vaguely recent wallpaper and some of the paintwork has been redone, but the carpet looks dirty and moth-eaten, fraying at the edges. The bed was one of the worst I have ever slept in at this price-point. Ancient doesn't quite cover it. The frame was wobbly and creaky, the mattress a mass of lumps and pokey, uneven and squealing springs. Every stick of furniture is scratched, dented, old-fashioned and in various states of battered-ness. The bathroom is circa 1950's I reckon, with a dribbly shower with little temperature control.  Such a shame - as the rest of the place is very nice and the people are lovely.  Come on Pendley - time to completely gut and redo your bedrooms! "
-2; What can I say? Slow check-in, finally being seen to by a robot. No cookies offered, which I believe to be a standard feature. We did have a wonderful meal and great views from our room, but come the time we wanted to retire and we simply couldn't sleep. Located below the (lovely) bar, we were met with noise of talking and music, but most deafeningly, the noise of chairs being dragged and what we later realised was bottles being thrown into a bin - so glass on glass echoing overhead. I say 'later realised' because we ended up going to the bar in a 'if you can't beat them join them' mentality. What should've been a relaxing evening and peaceful sleep was actually a disturbed rest that led to us being shattered the next day. The recompense was simply not enough (50% of the room rate which I believe was also wrongly calculated in their favour. I would've expected 100% refund for what was, without doubt, the worst night spent in a hotel. 
-2; We had picked up a menu earlier in the week and decided to go on a Thursday when it was curry night. Not all the party wanted curry however there was only a very limited alternative menu which included sandwiches, baguettes, baked potatoes etc. We had decided we were not staying but sat for 30 minutes to finish our drinks and still had not been approached by anyone to take our order. Poor show. As it happens we went someplace else who fitted us in at short notice and the food was very good. 
-2; My partner and I spent Christmas at the Royal Bath and were very disappointed with everything. The waiting staff just stood around a lot of the time and when we went down to breakfast we had to ask for tea/coffee as it was not given to us.  Entertainment was very poor. There was supposed to be games and quizzes but we didn't see any. Reception staff were unhelpful. Room was quite basic.  Felt very disappointed and let down over Christmas. 
-2; My husband and I stayed here for one night whilst visiting St Albans. I thought Mercure Hotels were a good standard but this is my second Mercure experience (the first being Paris) that I am less than impressed with. The hallway on our floor had a used cotton earbud on the floor, we saw empty bottles, and the bath tub was dirty which we didn't notice until the morning when we had to rush to shower and check out. When we told the hotel receptionist all he had to say was sorry about that. I felt dirty when I left and couldn't wait to get home to have a proper shower somewhere clean. 
-2; Went here with friends for a special birthday meal on 6th Feb 2016 which was a Saturday. The service was truly dreadful and several items on the menu were not available at 945 on a Saturday night. I have made an official complaint & so far the response to that has been good although the special occasion can never be replaced, I hope that this place picks up again because it it a lovely venue. 
-2; The rooms are noisy, cramped and old fashioned in need of refurbishment . The view from our window was like a prison block. Dirty carpets , very busy overcrowded , and expensive . The breakfast was ok if you like queuing for your food . Would not return ever again. 
-2; I booked this hotel for a treat when we attended a wedding in a nearby village. The hotel backs onto some nice gardens, but the rest of the postcode is full of school, about 6 of them. Huge and hideous buildings. It was very hard to find because of thus. The room was less than average, not like the stunning ones shown on the website. Breakfast was greasy and the cutlery was very dirty. There was a wedding at the venue the night we stayed, the music played until 1.25am! When I called reception to complain I was treated as if it was not an issue, I was expecting a grovelling apology! We asked for our money back, a full refund was given...the guests checking out behind us were also complaining. The daytime receptionist was lovely. She was the only redeeming feature. 
-2; I recommended Carden Park for afternoon tea to my friends for a 60th birthday treat for someone. We wanted to order the tea with a glass of sparkling wine as advertised on the web site only to be told this was just a special offer for the Royal wedding 2 YEARS AGO. We pointed out that it was still on the web site & were told we could buy a bottle of wine if we liked. We were on the back foot already. The sandwiches were ok. The scone was like a brick & the other cakes were moist but totally lacking flavour. As I had recommended it, I felt awful. 
-2; Met with no booking found. Very poorly mannered receptionist. Dirty carpets, crappy deluxe room, wrong bottle of wine delivered. Spa!!! Hardly class as a spa. 2 seats pool side a sauna with no control and a jacuzzi which is cold. Had to queue for dinner regardless of booking. Oh nearly forgot afternoon tea, hardly surprising!! We're deserted in the restaurant and told by waitress she was busy and to find her if we needed her!!!!! Dry sandwiches, horrible scones and some non descript desert thing!!!!  Spa treatment was not great, rushed and painful.   Never again Bracknell Hilton. You need to visit St Anne's manor and take a leaf from there book. 
-2; Negatives.. Worst night sleep I've ever had in a hotel. I was woken up by people in the corridor 5 times in the night from 2am until 6am all coming back from the nightclub and drinking. When it quietened down after that the room felt too light so I had to try and manoeuvre chairs in attempt to hide as much light coming in as possible from below and to the sides of the curtains. The whole building inside is very dated and needs modernising, the wooden doors have scratched varnish all over so it's not even as though they are maintaining an old fashioned appearance but keeping the quality good. The bathroom mat was a discoloured dirty brown which once would have been white.  The hotel staff were polite and professional but lacking in any personality to make you feel really welcomed.  Checking in the hotel was a long process - over 20minutes. When you are familiar with staying in Holiday Inn/Premier Inn/Travelodge which only takes 1 minute it's a long time to wait.  There were no hot drinks available at breakfast, if the hot drinks were meant to be served to you they were not, and no staff walked past to be able to ask and decided not to walk to find staff so my breakfast didn't go cold.  The food and drinks were very expensive but maybe that's normal for the area.  You had to pay £10 to go in the downstairs bar with music which we had already been in earlier in the day for free, we only wanted one drink after returning from a meal so a £10 wristband to use the bar and then onto the nightclub is far too expensive for just wanting one drink in the bar only.   Positives.. Breakfast was plentiful and tasted nice. Wifi is free and a good connection.   Good choice of well rated restaurants in Wokingham for a £10 taxi ride. 
-2; Stayed in room 118. It was in a disgusting state and shouldn't be let out to customers. The soundproofing is non existent. There was piles of dust and debris under the bed. Marks and coffee stains on the walls.  The bathroom is disgusting with a badly stained toilet. The bath has a missing grab handle which has been filled very badly. The paint on a shelf behind an uneven wash basin has paint peeling off. This same room has been commented on previously on trip advisor and yet they still let customers use it.  The one positive for the hotel was a very good buffet breakfast. 
-2;I had never previously stayed at this particular hotel and an acquaintance of mine had booked me a room. Upon arrival, the receptionist was very mannerly and efficient. I was given a choice of two floors .. a low one, or a high one. I chose the latter (Floor 12) as i was informed the higher floors were quieter and i would have a view of Hyde Park.  After my journey from Shropshire, i was happy to be in my room .. a double. The first thing i wanted was a cup of Coffee however, both cups were badly stained and looked as though they had only been rinsed quickly as opposed to washing well. Obviously i had to wash them out myself. Not the best of starts? Adding to that, the pull down shelf which you rest the Kettle on to boil, was strained and i had to keep an eye on it in for fear it might fall over and on to the carpet. It is actually positioned quite dangerously and especially if a child was in the room.  Having stayed in many 4/5* hotels in and around Mayfair, i was shocked at how tiny the bathroom was. If a couple were sharing the room, it is certain that two people could not be in the bathroom at the same time. Extremely compact. The whole bathroom was in need of some serious updating and refreshing. The bath itself (including the fittings and shower) had seen much better days as had the sealants surrounding the bath and the tiling. Very, very claustrophobic.  Back to the bedroom itself. The view from the very large window was amazing. I could look right down on to Sloane Street and to the extreme right i could just about locate the London Eye. To be quite honest, the view was the best thing about the room.  Nice large screened TV with multiple channels, nice, comfortable bed/Pillows and spotless bed linen but, a couple of sticky patches on the carpet. None of the usual, high quality Bathrobes, or Slippers usually found in previous hotels, which was a little disappointing and a nice extra which has been clearly missed!  I ordered one meal from Room Service which if i remember correctly, was a Steak and Blue Cheese Pie with mashed Potato. The Steak was very tough and not a very tasty dish to eat.  The foyer/Reception area and Bar were quite nice and seemed very, very clean areas, but in this particular case, it did not reflect, or follow on to the guest room which again, required completely refreshing and updating.
-2; We stayed at royal bath in January. Paid extra for sea view. We used a groupon voucher which included sparkling wine. The meal was a poor buffet. Felt like we was in butlins. The sparkling wine turned out to be a cheap bottle of perry. There were loads of people just leaving it and complaining. There was no atmosphere. Just large open room with table upon table lined up and all very close together with bright ceiling lights. Extremely disappointing. We stayed in a premier inn the night before and this just highlighted even further how tired and tatty the royal bath is. 
-2; A group of friends attended fizzy friday , we have been several times before and really enjoyed it . Unfortunately friday was different the choice of food was not worth the money , the pudding choice was disgusting . Most of all the staff were down right rude and unwelcoming a waitress called carol was rude to 3 members of our party . The barman was rude and surly and the manager wasnt much better, the young waitresss was helpful smiling and couldn't do enough maybe you should employ more people like her. Will never return again 
-2; On arrival reception very disinterested, once I told them we were on a Heritage one day deal. Room very clean and up to date, but very small and dark as only one small window. After looking around the town, the hotel is very well located, arrived back at hotel around 7pm to find no hot water to shower or bath. As this was a popular time for getting ready for going out thought hot water had probably run out, but 8am following morning still not hot water, phoned reception who said they had no problem with the hot water. Evening meal food was very good, but had to wait nearly 2 hours in total for three courses. Restaurant was very noisy and cold. Breakfast staff rude and again not interested. Liked Winchester but would choose different hotel. This hotel more for business clients and not tourists, as they seem to treat people on specials deals as second class. 
-2; We decided to take our Mum (89) for an afternoon tea post Xmas treat. We booked for 6 arriving at 2.30 pm. We sat in the Hall and were unattended for more than10 minutes before we were asked if would like to order, we ordered and the tea and coffee's duly arrived but it was another 40 minutes later before sandwiches and cakes arrived. There's was a lack of attention to detail eg only 5 cups arrived, no sugar, no butter for scones so causing further waiting.Where as we could not fault the quality of the afternoon tea the whole experience could have been better. There was no apology or explanation for the wait and there was only one other small party in the hall. 
-2;This is not a 4* hotel the room was okay mismatch furniture bed lumpy bathroom okay with walking shower. However the service left something to be desired. I am gluten free and dairy free and they were informed at booking and on arrival. However for breakfast they just plonked toast in a plastic basket down without asking. Also the meal took 45 mins as they kept forgetting us, it took a complaint from the management to get it sorted. On the 2nd morning service was better and they had my gluten free bread and the meal was hot. Would not recommend this hotel.
-2; On first appearance this hotel is very nice. It is very modern, very clean and the staff are very smiley.   However once you deviate from the standard hello there is little customer service.  I stayed 4 nights on business. My room was very modern, not very big but had everything you want. The bathroom was tiny and had a very modern sink which did not have a plug and when you turned on the designer taps the water splashed straight out the sink and all over me and the floor. There was no bathtub just a big shower. There was no way of having a shower without the water bouncing off the bottom of the shower tray and onto the floor. If you had the shower mat on the floor you couldn't open the door and there is no room for a wash bag near the the sink.  The heat in the room was extreme. There was an air conditioning unit and you could change the temperature up or down but it didn't actually work. It seemed to stick at 22 C or above. In the night it went up to 24.5 C so it was way too hot to sleep.  I reported that my room was too hot to the busy receptionist who said he'd look into it. But as I was out all day I emailed to confirm my request. I did not get any reply to my email. When I returned to the hotel the room was baking. I telephoned reception and was told that the hotels heating system was switched on to heat and therefore could not blow cold air so I would have to open the window for 20 minutes and then close it. The hotel is on a main road so it's too noisy but I did do this. Unfortunately as soon as I did the temperature went up even higher to 24.5 C. I telephoned reception again after 20 minutes but did not get an answer. I had to go down to the Reception area. I was then given another room. The second room was slightly larger and was cooler although during the night it still got too hot to sleep. It also had the same issue with the sink and shower tray.  I was not offered any help to move room, I was not asked if I was happier in the room, I was just told to return the old room key to the reception when I'd moved. This took place at 8.30pm so not in the middle of the night.  At breakfast I was asked twice if I wanted toast but it never arrived. Also there are stairs in the restaurant - something not mentioned on their website. The fruit juice and butter and cereal is all up the stairs and the hot buffet down stairs so you have to walk up or down the stairs carrying your plate and glass. You have to figure that out for yourself as noone explains this to you.  On the 2nd day in my new room the toiletries were not replaced so I had no shampoo and just a tiny bit of shower gel left over from the previous day. I was so sick of speaking to reception I didn't bother calling down and asking for more.  On the plus side I did have room service twice and that was very good - they telephone to tell you they are on the way up which is a nice touch and the food was nice.  On checking out I was not asked if I was happy with my stay. Infact at no point are you asked if you are happy with the food, with the service, with the hotel.  You get the smiles and friendly greeting but unfortunately that's where it stops they are not interested in you as a guest and your answer is irrelevant.  I would only stay here if you don't need to sleep, have lots of patience to wait to be served, are going to take your own toiletries and are able to negotiate stairs.  A very disappointing stay. 
-2; All the staff were willing to help, and went out of their way to ensure we had a comfortable stay. As a guest I felt for the amount of money paid the hotel itself didn't live up to my expectations. The hotel was meant as a romantic surprise for my partner initially I booked Friday night in the King-size Executive room, a couple of weeks later I decided to book the Saturday night as well. Over email I was told this was fine, when I rang reservations I was told I couldn't book Saturday night as well as I had a non-changeable room. This then put me under quite a lot of pressure as I knew that we wouldn't be in the same room for both consecutive nights. Considering all my options I decided to book a slightly smaller room and when arriving at the hotel decided to inform the check in desk. This is when I upgraded to the same room type I had booked for the Friday so we could stay in one room for the whole weekend. This was easy enough. But the room was very small and stuffy I didn't think it lived up to its king-size executive status, I was told all the rooms were similar and I did ask to upgrade to a suit but unfortunately there wasn't any available. The second room was slightly better but again it was small and stuffy and taking into consideration that all the rooms were similar and it was just the higher floor and access to executive lounge that was part of the upgrade. On arriving there were no car parking spaces left, when booking the room I was told that I couldn't reserve a parking space, I wasn't informed that there was a chance the parking would be full, otherwise I would have made previous arrangements, instead we had to carry 4 bags 5-6 minutes up the road from another parking area. The room was claustrophobic and dated, we didn't have toilet amenities provided such as enough toilet roll or hand tissues. Our room service from the previous night was not cleared all weekend this was also the case with our breakfast. when ordering room service we waited 47min the toast and tea was served cold. Overall i would sum up my stay as a serious disappointment, I was expecting a spacious, clean up to date room for the price. I have received far better service in hotels for half of the price paid. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again and wouldn't recommend it. 
-2; We had been camping with friends locally and as a last minute thing we decided to book afternoon tea at Seckford. Staff were friendly and efficient over the phone and the booking was easy.   The hotel itself is very striking and in good condition and initially we were impressed. However, we were not at all impressed either with quality or value of the afternoon tea itself. The cost was over £15 per person (without a glass of champagne/sparkling wine). For this we got 3 small finger sandwiches (which had little or no filling!) and some pretty uninspiring and unoriginal cakes. They did provide a good amount of clotted cream but it was extremely badly presented and just slopped in the bowl.  We also had 4 children with us and so we asked whether they could advise how much to order or whether they could do an extra plate of sandwiches. There was very little flexibility and we ended up ordering 4 afternoon teas between the 8 of us and so we expected a good amount of food for near £70 (!) but it was very stingy compared to many other places we have been.  In the same vain - as we'd arrived early and the children were asleep in the car, my friend and I had a drink in the spa while we waited and the men stayed in the car. 2 hot chocolates cost £6 which I wouldn't normally bat an eye lid at but the service was not exactly 'with a smile' and it was just the same as the hot chocolate as you find in a car garage waiting room. How they could justify £3 per cup I do not know!  Our friends do not like making a fuss and so we decided not to say anything at the time as we did not want to embarrass them but felt that some feedback was required.  We stay in a lot of very nice places and have no problem paying well for good service and quality but this fell a long way short of the prices they were demanding. Real shame as it had such promise. 
-2;" My friend and I booked a 'pamper day'. Started off well, we were shown around by the male receptionist downstairs and introduced to the 'spa receptionist'.   The spa receptionist showed us where the lockers (10p needed) robes etc were. We were asked if we had considered further treatments to which we booked an extra £30 Indian head massage.   We changed into robes/swimming stuff and went for a coffee- the machine produced tepid coffee and after one cup could provide no more hot water.   We decided to use the pool (freezing cold) and the sun loungers. There was a huge white hair clip by the sun loungers which remained there all day- and as we were the first in, god only knows how long it had been there.   Then. The jacuzzi beside the pool. Ok. The 'bubbles did not work. Nor did the lights and again, on the steps into it there was a clearly used plaster that remained there all day.   We used the sauna which was ok (hard to mess that up). Having travelled extensively, the hamman facility- is a wet/steam room, nothing more.   The outside jacuzzi; walls covered in green mould substance. Bubbles actually worked though.   After a lacklustre 'salad' lunch we went upstairs to get ready for our extra treatment. Upon my going to the locker area I was accosted by a 'therapist' who was to say politely down right hostile. The therapist stated we could not have the extra treatment as it was included in the pre-booked pamper day treatment. At this, I went back to my friend (an elemis trained professional) who couldn't quite understand what the problem was.   Upon going to the spa reception desk at out allotted appointment time we were met by three 'therapists' who all tried to explain that we had pre-booked a shoulder massage which included some scalp and they didn't want us 'wasting' our money. Despite attempting several times to actually get the treatment we were refused and offered a mini mani OR pedi. My friend is also trained to do this and our nails were already perfect BESIDES which we wanted and had booked a massage!  After being refused, this left us for another hour- during what should have been our treatment time two therapists were downstairs giggling/flirting(?) with the male receptionist.  Upon finally getting our pamper day package treatment time the therapists were ten minutes late taking us in- to a joint treatment room, leaving us another five minutes to get changed (no where to put your clothes).  The treatment lasted half an hour (yes we timed it) during which the therapists were slamming the containers onto the work top and were throwing things into a bin = noisy and very hard to relax.   Afterwards. We again attempting a coffee. The machine was still in need of water so went back downstairs. Here we had adding but were told anything else would be extra- no signs- by an abrupt now female receptionist. We went upstairs, showed and left. No one bothered to say 'goodbye' or bother with any other pleasantries.   All in all. Very disappointing. You can get so much more for your money. Please do not waste your time here. Go elsewhere and have a nice time! "
-2; The hotel looks fine from the outside,rooms not to bad ,breakfast good , evening meal rubbish, stale rolls ,lukewarm soup, carvery ,not hot ,chewy meat ,reheated ,roasts pots,you could throw at the wall and they would bounce,back, the desserts were gatuex,and frit salad tinned my l ask, same menu both nights ,just a change of meat, very poor,but they had some super equipment to use ,obliviously didn't know how to use it ,as it was an anniversary trip this hotel spoilt it . 
-2; I stay here a lot. In fact a year ago or so I gave this a cracking review, however sadly for some reason, this hotel has decided that looking after regular customers isn't a priority? At least that's how it seems after my most recent stay?  I asked Work to book and pre pay this room. As I stay here often, I know that you have to ensure that the Hotel knows you won't have the payment card with you when you check in, so my office manager made sure she liaised with their Head Office and sent through EVERYTHING they asked for (card details, photographs of the card, evidence that its OK to use that and a form filled out) which meant I could arrive and check in smoothly. Even on the day of travel I checked with my office that this had been done and I was sent an email that Park Grand had sent to her saying everything was OK.  I arrive and check in. I am asked for the payment card. I explain that my Work have paid and that we have liaised with Head Office and filled out the necessary authorisation forms and that everything was deemed fine. The Receptionist looks, but has no record of any of this. She then checks with the office at the hotel who also have no record. I offer to show her the authorisation email sent to me by her own company, but she still then rings her own head office, who take about 10 minutes over the phone to then say it's OK for me to check in. All this time I am left at reception feeling frustrated at the delay, as we did everything right and yet STILL check in is not running smoothly. Eventually the Receptionist confirms I am free to check in. She then gives me a basement room.   Now I have stayed here before and say I do not want a basement room. The basement rooms often overlook the pavement which is never secure for a female lone traveller. I explain this. However I am told I can check the room. I say there's no point, I do not want a basement room, it isn't safe for me and can I have another room? The Receptionist insists I look at the room so now I am made to go and look at the room. Sure enough, it has a double patio door window that opens right up onto the pavement. This is so unsafe and I wouldn't feel OK sleeping on ground level knowing these doors could open up or be forced open by anyone. I refuse the room. I then have to wait 5 more minutes until another room is found and I go to that.   I am now given the smallest room I have ever stayed in at this hotel. My small case almost fills the space between the door and the bathroom. The bathroom itself has the tiny sink placed behind the door, so that means the door doesn't open fully. The bed is literally a hand span away from the desk (see photo). I am by no means a large person, In fact I am quite slender, yet I had to squeeze past this and ended up with a bruised leg thanks to the handle on the desk drawer digging in. How a larger person or an older person would cope in this room is beyond me?   I am so disappointed by my recent stay it has made me disregard the almost monthly (in some cases weekly) satisfactory visits I have had here over the past 18 months and write this new review. This hotel needs to ask itself the following questions... Where is the customer care and loyalty recognition? I stay here so regularly so why palm me off with such a terribly cramped room after trying to initially give me a basement room with patio doors that open onto the pavement? Where is the staff training so that they know how to pass on pre-authroised rooms and payments to ensure a smooth check in? Shouldn't your Head Office send this through to the relevant hotel immediately?? Why aren't the staff educated as to why lone female travellers are never placed on a ground floor level as it's less secure for them?   I don't understand why this visit was so terribly bad. If this had happened after my first visit I wouldn't have returned and spent 18 months paying for rooms here. Please, do not treat your loyal customers so very badly. I look forward to your feedback.   Will I stay again? I really don't know? Not unless I have some sort of reassurance from Management that these issues are being addressed. Lone female business travellers, perhaps look elsewhere in the neighbourhood where you may be treated a little more professionally. 
-2; The hotel itself is in a prime spot and the staff all very friendly and helpful however this is a 4 star hotel with 4 star prices and the bedrooms do not reflect that price...  I was quite amazed how small our standard room was and that it only had a double bed (we have not slept in one for 30 years and never in a 4* hotel). We had a terrible nights sleep in a tiny bed with an old mattress as when we tried to turn over you rolled into the middle of the bed. The rooms was tiny as well, however the man who snored all night long in the room next door obviously had a better nights sleep than us! When I did think I might have fallen asleep I was wakened at 7am by the sound of swirling water and I thought I was in an aquarium. The room became alive with the sounds of all the showers and baths being run in the neighbouring rooms and subsequent water running down pipes..  I did ask reception if all the bedrooms had double beds and was advised that they do apart from the superior rooms - I really feel that even though the rooms are tiny all customers in this day and age paying to go to a high rated star hotel, expect to have a luxuirous bed and bedding and to get a good nights sleep. I have slept in better B&B's for a quarter of the price.  We had the evening meal (if not taken only a £10 deduction was allowed for a £35 meal), which was included in our deal but only just made it back for the 9pm deadline - there were a few people in the lovely large dining room but by 9.30pm we were the only diners left - leaving us to ask where everyone had gone - the same story in the bar - 10pm - all but empty on a Saturday night - no music, no people, it seems an extraordinary waste of resources and revenue!  Such a lovely well positioned hotel, ruined for us by not actually catering for its guests in a 4* manner but who are paying 4* prices. 
-2; It is a newly decorated, modern hotel, I d give you that. However it was lacking the service/substance. The room I got checked in was just behind the bar so I could hear glasses smashed around and could easily smell food.  Then 20 mins later I realised the wifi did not work in my room. A staff came in to help and confirmed that it was not working. He left then asked for help, and asked me to wait.  I said if we could switch room and a lady at the reception just again said you had to wait.  Eventually they backed down and agreed to move me to another room (!). However it was a much smaller room than I had in the first place. Luckily there is no smell of food or kitchen noises.   I am not too sure about the service either. I had an ultra light Rimowa suitcase with hardly any stuff in it and it has the best suitcase wheels in the world to be moved around( it was practically empty and lighter than my handbag ) The reception lady did offer to take it but so reluctant that I found it a bit embarrassing.  Just before I changed my room I had taken a shower - so I was in a silk dressing gown ( perfect to be worn outside of bedroom ) before we moved room the reception lady checked with me twice as to whether I want to be seen like that going across the hall way. I can assure you it wasnt a nice reminder - ultimately it was not because of me that I had to change room just after taken a shower but a wifi problem.  The next morning when I checked out the reception staff asked me about my stay - I thought I d just mention the internet problem and the fact that I got moved to a smaller room. However the lady ( different one) just shook in disbelief that the internet could not have stopped working. I had to spend 3 mins trying to convince her that was the case. Her explanation on the room was also very dry.  I am actually on a long term business stay so potentially would stay till the end of the year - I am a bit disappointed with my stay and have moved to other hotels ever since. 
-2; Very disappointed with this hotel.We had been previously when The Royal Bath was owned by DeVere and had a fantastic stay which is why we returned.Unfortunately this beautiful building is now tired and shabby,the rooms are dirty and showers completely useless.The staff although quite pleasant are all foreign and don't understand what you are asking which caused complications and took ages to check in.The standard of food is poor and the dining room staff are unorganised,slow,untidy and again foreign so do not understand what you ask.We returned home very sad that such a once first class Hotel has been so badly neglected.Shame on Brittania. 
-2; My recent stay at this hotel was not that great. My best friend got married there so me and my bf booked a room to stay over night. The restaurant, bar etc everything on the lower floor were nice however i was disappointed with our room hugely. We got discount for advance booking from £156 to £76 so thought this was a great deal. As i walked round the room i noticed the wallpaper was peeling off, scuff marks on the walls, the bath which had an overhead shower was black on the bit you stand on under the shower and the spare mattress that pulls out from under the bed was covered in stains, the carpet had a few on it too. We were on the ground floor and the view out of the window was a brick wall. To top it off my friend was staying in the honeymoon suit that night and it looked exactly like our room nothing special at all very basic. This is a 4* hotel but i wont be staying here again 
-2; Very noisey, pillows and duvet not great, seems very dated. For £240 per night we wasn't impressed. The first room received was tiny and next to a construction site, once moved the room was better but still the stay was not relaxing. The first receptionist was very rude, it wasn't until we complained that they stepped up the service 
-2; We booked one night at Clarence House which I hadn't realised didn't include breakfast until confirmation arrived which had a no refund clause...on arrival the hotel is lovely looking and after a long drive appeared clean and tidy at reception if a bit 80's. We were checked in, offered wake up calls, papers etc...and advised where the room was. While the bathroom appeared clean and smelt of bleach, and the shower despite being old was fine, the room needed some TLC ...chairs were stained , lampshades stained , furnishings worn ...the gorgeous bed had a very wobbly fitting and was so high even I had to hitch myself up and I'm 5'10. Decor needed attention, cobwebs removing and generally the place needs a refurb. The bed was comfy and when we spoke with a member of staff we were advised we could go down for breakfast at £15.95 a head...which we felt was excessive for breakfast so got our own elsewhere for less than half the price. The hotel has lovey gardens and potential to be a lovely place to stay but sadly reminded us of a very tired care home in need of cleaning rather than a 4* hotel and certainly not worth the fees charged and we got a cheaper deal than usual tariff???maybe that's why we had a room in need of attention? 
-2;We came here for a spa, treatment and afternoon tea for my nieces birthday. The pool was lovely but we had a long wait for the afternoon tea which was served on a table full of used cups and plates of left over food. We actually moved them further up the table thinking that they would move them and clean the table but no, our sandwiches,cakes and tea were put on the dirty table amongst dirty plates. It was very tasty but not pleasant. We then asked when we would be called for our treatments as we were told on the phone that all four of us would be seen to at the same time, together. The lady came and asked for the first person and we waited for someone else to come for the next person,only to be told at reception that we would be seen one after the other. This put an hour and a half on top of an already late booking making our arrival home to be after 7pm. The treatments were excellent but we couldn't even relax in the relaxing area to wait as this is situated next to a gym next door where the weights were constantly being dropped to the floor causing us to jump a mile every time. I don't know whose idea that was!! Overall ,not the relaxing day that we were expecting at all.
-2;" My friend and I wanted a nice girlie spa weekend away, not too far from London, at the end of August. We found the Ashford International on bookaspa.com and the price seemed a little high, but it was short notice and we were determined to go somewhere so we booked it. It's very accessible by car and was easy to find. Parking was fine. The room was well decorated (save for an obvious area of what looked like water damage on the ceiling), comfortable, and generally satisfactory, apart from the extreme low level lighting in the bathroom, and room in general actually, and very low pressure shower.   The package we had booked included a couple of treatments in the spa. Since the spa was our main reason for going away, we headed there soon after checking in. On arrival to the spa/ leisure reception, we were not acknowledged by staff and had to introduce ourselves. They had our treatments and times mixed up from what we'd booked but that was resolved and then we went to explore. What a disappointment. The pool area more resembled what you might expect from a tired local authority leisure centre rather than a spa (billed as 4 star on the website we booked through). It was very cramped and noisy, with only about 4 plastic loungers at one end and a very narrow area between the side of the pool and the wall, against which were a line of upright plastic patio chairs. There were 2 stone &quot;heated&quot; loungers, which we'd seen on the website. These were not working. The &quot;experience&quot; settings on the experience shower were also not working, so it was just a shower. The whole pool/ spa area was a bit dilapidated, with rusty fixtures and fittings and plastic cups lying around.  The theme of things lying around ran through the duration of our stay. We noticed a distinct lack of expediency when it came to clearing up the communal areas of the hotel, from empty glasses being left in the relaxation room of the spa, to trays of dirty dishes left outside rooms for a whole day and used cups and saucers sitting for hours on the coffee tables in the seating areas outside the restaurant. The hotel didn't have much of an atmosphere in the first place but was modern and quite nicely decorated and this neglect just spoilt it.   The spa treatments themselves were disappointing. One of mine was a back massage, which, despite me asking the therapist to use as much pressure as she could, was very ineffectual and frustrating. My friend was happier with her experience. There was a relaxation room to sit in before your treatments. It would have been more relaxing if the therapists had refrained from chatting very loudly outside the door.   The package we had booked included dinner on both nights, and breakfast. The service was very, very slow at dinner on the first night and the food was uninspiring. My mashed potato was cold and unseasoned. I did mention the temperature to the waitress but didn't take her up of the offer to send it back to the kitchen for fear I'd still be waiting for a replacement half an hour later. We weren't as unsatisfied with our dinner as some of the other patrons that evening. We witnessed one woman apoplectic at her tiny portion size and the time she'd had to wait for it. We overheard at least one other couple complaining about the long wait for food.   After all the disappointing aspects of our stay, breakfast was a revelation. The selection of hot and cold items was excellent, as was the quality. It was a self-service buffet but seemed to be replenished frequently and is one of, if not the best breakfast I've had in a British hotel.   All in all and considering what we were after out of this booking, it was unsatisfactory and a huge disappointment. I wish I had complained to the management at the time but to be honest, I was so let down I didn't want to dwell on it. I recently came across an email from the booking website asking me to rate my experience though, so after doing that, I thought I'd do a more comprehensive review.   If you're just after a place to stay en route to France it would be fine but the spa and leisure facilities, along with general tidying up and lack of attention to detail really let it down as a place to go for a relaxing weekend away. On the plus side, brilliant breakfast. "
-2; Hi have always stayed in Hilton Hotels and had the best experience but this was awful. I paid the summer saver rate but didnt expect a saver room and bed ! the worst nights sleep I have ever had and if they cant afford new matresses at the Hilton I am shocked they gave me what I can only describe as a duvet as a matress topper uncomfortable and lumpy. So dissapointed as I have stayed here before when I went on holiday as its convenient but I feel as I paid a cheaper rate I was given a cheap room that to be honest I didnt think the Hilton would want associated with their brand. Along with this we had a yellow stained carpet. 
-2; this hotel reception area and rooms are comfortable, our plan was because of a good days shopping we planned to eat and drink in this hotel very disappointing .The bar did not sell branded drinks but still charged branded prices.The Evening meal was disappointing, sitting in a cold empty restaurant apart from us said it all. Unusual mix on plates for starters ie fish cakes on a bed if red onion and green beans, main meals added cost for sides ,steak served, chips a good while later steak then cold, Pork belly meal microwave hot, pudding sticky toffee , served with banana ice cream ?? No mention of flavour on description. Requested bottled water to take to room 5 of us only 2bottles in hotel. 
-2; The hotel looks beautiful from the exterior but the rooms are down an extensive maze of bland modern corridors. Booked a classic king, nothing special about the room and very over-priced compared to other hotels. The worst experience was the meal which was very average, however the service was terrible and certainly not what I would expect from a Macdonald hotel. We didn't even get to eat our dessert as we walked out of the restaurant, having sat with our dinner plates in front of us and nothing to drink for 30 minutes and no attention or service. 
-2; Stayed here recently for a nearby wedding.  The accommodation was cheap and we were happy with the price that we payed although we did find the hotel very strange - bit like a student campus. It was quite loud and the rooms were very basic. It was a large hotel which was set out like a students campus!  Breakfast was good and the hotel managed well with large numbers of guests.  The hotel was ok for a night as a wedding guest but I wouldn't recommend staying here for a weekend break. 
-2; We thought we would have a trip out and decided to call in to Sidmouth and have lunch. We choose to go to the Riviera Hotel. We have been many times in the pass but not in the last year but remembered it to be a good Sunday lunch. We were very disapointed!!.The beef was of poor quality, sliced by a machine slicer giving the texture of processed meat.The food was cold and tasteless and as it was not busy we expected it to be piping hot and not luke warm!! The lunch was vastly over priced and when we complained no one wanted to listen. We paid for our lunch but will not be returning!!!! 
-2;Arrived late Friday night. Asked for a non smoking room but that was a waste of time, it stunk of cigarettes and the bathroom floor was so dirty . The whole place needs a good clean and upgrade. The room was not good but the breakfast was.  Next time i will go to the Premier Inn far superior.
-2;" My husband and I came to dinner with you on Saturday night- the restaurant was busy but not overly crowded- food was lovely but service was terrible- We were seated promptly and our drinks order was taken- 15 minutes later our WATER arrived! When our order was finally taken the food did arrive in reasonable time- however, once we had been served our main course we seemed to be ignored. I don't really expect to sit and look at my dirty plate for well in excess of 20 minutes (who knows HOW long this would have been if I hadn't signalled the waiter)., I wouldn't do it at home and clearly don't wish to do so on what was supposed to be a special night out. At the end of the evening after a LONG wait for our bill- the Maitre d' bought it to us and commented (with NO apology) that we had been kept waiting a lot - I replied that we were very disappointed and that the service fell WELL below that which we would have expected- again, no apology… he just shrugged his shoulders and said &quot;it's the staff&quot;. Had we been offered some form of apology or even a complementary coffee I may have considered returning in the hope that we had just been unlucky but for us, the acknowledgement of poor service without even so much of a verbal apology was the final insult. SO very very disappointed, we did try to not let it ruin our evening but it was difficult not to. "
-2; The Good:  Staff very friendly, from checking in to checking out, from dealing with our room change quickly to bringing my shoes to me in a restaurant (don't ask) and personally walking there to do it - really, really great staff that can't be faulted.  Beds are comfy and good toiletries.  The Bad: The whole place needs a complete refurb. We had to change rooms because our first room was grubby. Stains on the chaise longue, on the throw on the bed and all over the decorative cushions. The 2nd room was marginally better but at least smelled more fresh.   The rooms are REALLY dark which I wouldn't mind but there is literally no where with good light to do your makeup - ladies, take note!   All the chairs in the bar are fraying - I almost felt embarrassed for the hotel. How can you leave out frayed, tired and worn chairs for your guests that are paying a minimum of £159 per night?  Such a shame. I booked the room for my hubby's 30th birthday as we had a party in town but wont be back - not unless it's been fully refurbed and cleaned. 
-2; Arrived Friday night upgraded room due to being hilton honours carpets a bit threadbare at doorway, few stains on duvet cover wasn't too bad to get changed but not what I would expect for a hilton , gym good ,good service in bar - had breakfast included in room price but felt less selection than a year ago no Danish pastries,orange juice tasted diluted service was good though 
-2; I stayed here about 8 years ago so I was sure that I didn't need to search around for other hotels in the area as I was happy the first time. However, I was very disappointed as the quality of the rooms, dining area and general hotel had gone down quite a bit. The food was very substandard, we had lunch when we arrived and the chicken was very dry, I think it had been pre cooked then warmed up so we decided to eat dinner elsewhere and book lunch the next day somewhere else too. Breakfast was included but again I was disappointed with the quality of the food. I don't feel that this hotel is worth what they charge albeit that it looks lovely in the pictures. I'm sorry but I feel it represents a 3 star hotel not a 4 star. 
-2; Our stay here was full of disappointments, which added up to us being sure we wouldn't return.  We decide to take a road trip to Cornwall for our honeymoon and booked our first night here to kick things off in style..  Firstly it took 2 members of staff to check in each guest one at a time, which was painful and unnecessarily slow, when we did finally get to the room it wasn't what I had agreed over the phone but as they were fully booked they wouldn't change us. Following that the fridge in the room didn't work and the wall paper was torn, the pillows and the duvet were both hard and synthetic too, not a hint of goose down anywhere, not what you would expect from a £235 rate?  Despite being on our honey moon we were told that a late checkout would cost us an additional £10 per hour and we were unable to get a table reservation before 9.30 that evening, room service would have been an option but with a tray change of £6, it was frankly a rip off.  I think the 2 things that really bothered me most were the food, I've had better served to me in a Tesco cafe and the portions were silly tiny, and the security.., our room door didn't lock which we didn't realise until we got back from the spa that first evening as it had sounded like it had as we left, just the fright you don't want when you've left your engagement and wedding rings in the room 'for safety' while you use the pool.... We then had maintenance in our room all evening try to fix it, just the romantic start to the honeymoon I was looking for...  From The Cornwall no word of apology, no discount, no nothing, so from us no recommendation and no return. 
-2; I stayed at Eastwood hall for two nights in July. The place felt like it needed to be renovated especially the showers whose water pressure and heat could vary at their own will. The pillows were not satisfactory at all and they only provide two which made for an uncomfortable nights sleep.  The breakfast was the best meal they provided here and the lady who was in charge of checking room numbers and seating people was very lovely and chatty. I did try both the bar and restaurant food neither of which were any good. The staff in the restaurant could not cope with large groups and there was a long time to order, the wrong food arrived and we were then rushed out of the restaurant despite only receiving our deserts five minutes earlier.  Overall as the title says I was glad it wasn't me paying for this as I feel I would have been ripped off. 
-2; I have stayed at several QHotels for spa deals and always had a very good experience so booked in to The Chesford Grange. I was extremely disappointed with many aspects.  The spa treatments were fantastic! The spa changing rooms are impossibly too small with people queuing to get changed. The floor was very dirty in the changing rooms. There was no water available poolside/by the steamroom, which I would expect. In order to get water you have to go through the changing rooms, get dressed and walk to the spa reception - not good after using the steamroom!  The room I stayed in (old part of the hotel) was lovely a spacious with character but very cold. One window wouldn't shut and the bathroom had only a small towel rail to heat it which was totally inadequate. I had to request extra bedding and a fan heater to keep warm.  I was kept awake until 2:45 with a party in the bar area and very noisy guests running around shouting in the bedroom corridors. I did phone reception but the noise continued. I complained in the morning and was offered a £17.50 reduction on my £145 bill - I don't think that was satisfactory for a very poor night sleep.  The evening meal was also disappointing with an overcooked fish for the main course, fingerprints in the ice-cream from being served up and no chutney available in the kitchen as a relish for the starter. This is not what I expect from a 4* hotel!  I wouldn't recommend this hotel and I won't be returning. 
-2; We visited this hotel for one night on the 27th May en-route to the USA. The rooms themselves were pleasant, nice and clean, beds quite comfy. I liked the little reading light attached to the bedside lamp. My Son booked two king sized bedrooms, but what we were given were two disabled rooms! I can not really see how this mistake was made! My Son and Husband went to reception to tell them we had been given the wrong rooms and to be fair, they did offer to change them. But after a day at work and not arriving until evening, no one felt up to moving, as we had over a one and half hour journey to get there and all the cases and other luggage had been dragged in to the rooms. They offered us free breakfasts to compensate, which was good enough. It was a buffet style, but I had a hair on my sausage, all our scrambled eggs were mushy and runny and the bacon was like cardboard! I did tell a young girl who was serving the tea and coffee and she pleasantly asked me 'What I would like her to do about it'. I would have thought she should have told the manager. But we were due to go to the airport, so nothing was done. My Son is writing to the hotel, so I'll keep you posted. The Staff were very nice and it was great just having a short walk into the airport, as the hotel is attached to it by a walkway, the real reason this hotel was chosen. But I'm not sure we would use it again. We certainly wouldn't eat breakfast there. 
-2; We first stayed here around 11 years ago and we loved it so much we recommended it to friends who subsequently got married here! So we were really excited to be returning on a two day stay booked directly with the hotel. This is the first time I have ever asked for my room to be downgraded! We had originally booked a 'Castle Keep' room. Now I understand that castles will be atmospheric but this room was dark, dismal and smelt foisty. We were then offered a 'Court Yard' Room which was much lighter. However after resting on the bed for 30 minutes I noticed that the bed felt damp, the room also had a foisty damp smell about it. Onto a third room, which was a 'Mews' Room.....much better. We had booked the Black Night Restaurant for our second night, but after sampling the cream tea, a beef sandwich from the bar and a below average breakfast we cancelled and ate out! The saving grace for this hotel were the friendly staff who accommodated our every wish. It seems that as the years have gone by the Management have compromised on many aspects. The hotel feels damp, the food served is not hand made but much of it processed. The hotel, instead of having an authentic castle feel is more like a theme park attraction....please get rid of the terrible staff uniforms which are sadly failing to replicate dress of days gone by. 
-2;" We booked a SPA day for 5 of us through Travel Zoo for my mum's birthday - and what a disapointment !! We arrived in time to the hotel and we were queueing up to check in for our treatments just to be told that our vouchers need to be printed out (on the booking voucher was clearly saying that barcode can be scanned or/and booking number provided). This caused some delay and we ended up having 15-20 mins less on our treatments. Due to the delay a friend was told &quot;to hurry up&quot; (by a lady who was suppose to be doing her back massage) which I thought it was totally unacceptable, rude and unproffesional. The bar is a bit of a walk from the pool area and only water and tea were available to drink from the machine around the pool area - no coffee !! We came back for the second treatment which was booked an hour and half later, we arrived 10mins before to be told to sit down by the pool and someone will call us. 20 mins later no one turned up and we ended up having another 10-15 mins knocked off of our treatments .. The pool water was foggy I presume from all them oils used for massaging as I haven't seen anyone having a quick rinse before enetring the pool and to top it off, we left our towels on lounges and when we got back from our second treatment the towels were gone and someone else was our lounges. I stayed in 2* and 3* hotels before and their service was much better than in this hotel. I will not be returning. Not surprised that they make offers of 40% off (or whatever) the spa treatments and looks like they knock off another % of their professional service too. "
-2; Firstly, I cannot believe this hotel is rated as a 3*, I would call it 1-2* at a push. The rooms are the most basic I have ever stayed in, with no bathroom amenities provided (shampoo, soap etc) and the beds are like camp beds! The bed linen and cushion covers feel like paper, it looks as though they have been put there with no outer covers at all. The mattress feels like a rollaway one. And the walls are like paper too all you can hear is other peoples tvs and conversations. The rooms are also far too hot and no air con when I stayed there. So choose something else wherever possible when staying in Manchester!! 
-2; Very disappointing, I would have expected nice bone china, tea in a teapot not hot water and tea bags on a saucer, no milk in the jug that was placed on the table it was empty. This had been pre booked as a celebration. The champagne never arrived, when my grand daughter spoke with the waiter she was given a bottle of Prosecco for eleven people. I queried this and was given a second bottle. I pointed out that this was not Champange . The staff were polite. 
-2; We came here for afternoon tea, following a busy day seeing the sights of Liverpool. The decor of the bar was lovely and modern and the toilets were clean. Unfortunately, the table we were seated at was very dirty, which I don't know how the waiter missed when he gave us our menus. Although it wasn't at all busy at the time, he seemed to be in such a great rush and we had difficulty calling him back to clean it. Following this, we ordered an afternoon tea, which included tea, scones, cream and jam. The teapots arrived along with the scones, but there were no teabags in the teapot which then had to be taken away by the waitress and replaced. Most of the scones were nice. However, I have a feeling that they microwave them before giving them to guests, in order to appear 'freshly baked' because although the scones were 'warm', one of them when biting through it, was incredibly hard and crusty all the way through, which happens when you warm scones too long in the microwave. For the price that we paid per head for tea and scones, and to get microwaved crusty scones, was very disappointing. I'm just glad we didn't go for the more expensive option!  Obtaining our bill at the end was also another difficulty as the waitering staff were difficult to get hold of and took a long time to produce the bill once it had been requested. All in all, not a great experience, but the decor is nice. 
-2;We had booked into the hotel on March 25th because I was attending a course there the following day. I had called to enquire about a room stressing that it needed to be lovely as it was my fortieth birthday. I was prepared to book somewhere else but the receptionist told me they had a newly refurbished suite that we could have at the rate of a luxury double room. When we arrived the receptionist was very friendly and the room was nice enough, although not what you would imagine by the term ‘suite’. There was significant road noise coming in from what I assumed was an open window but I discovered that there was no sound proofing and the single glazed windows let in every noise from the busy road below and the regular planes that fly overhead. Our outlook was of a lap-dancing club and rundown buildings covered in graffiti. On the bedside tables earplugs had been provided for those who did not like the sound of ‘city life’. This had not been mentioned at the time of booking. Within the bathroom one of the toilet rolls had been half used and the other had a patch of wet on it. We were moved to another room which was nicely done but small and claustrophobic. We asked to be moved again – by now my birthday was becoming spoilt – and were shown a budget double which was very basic with a zip link bed (below premier inn standard) but it was quiet and of an okay size. The manager was very courteous and left a birthday card in the room along with a packet of coconut ice and a voucher for drinks. Unfortunately the voucher was for a small glass of house wine which I left as it was of a very poor quality. We were very disappointed not to have the suite or luxury room that we had wanted for what was a special birthday and ensured we were out of the hotel for as long as possible. Breakfast was of a good quality and plentiful. When we went to check out the manager attempted to charge us for breakfasts and car parking. When we pointed out that we were actually expecting a discount as we’d been put into a basic double having paid for a suite he said that ‘as a concession’ he wouldn’t charge us for breakfast or the £5 car parking fee. I stated that I was not happy but as I was due to attend a training event at the hotel I couldn’t take more upset by arguing my case. When I mentioned what had happened to the course leader she commented on how noisy she had also found the hotel. The noise did not stop during the morning of the training event I attended either as another group had been put into an adjacent room and the noise carried through into our own making it difficult to hear our speaker and impossible to hear any questions from delegates. To be fair, the lunch that was provided was delicious although it was served 20 minutes late. Overall, if you want to stay here, the staff are courteous but do not expect any kind of refund if you are unhappy with the service or accommodation. I still cannot believe we paid £120 for a budget room and only received a drinks voucher and breakfast/car parking as compensation for two room moves, being put into an inferior room and a ruined birthday. Many of the rooms are noisy and the basic double rooms certainly cannot compete with Premier Inn which is where I wish we’d stayed!
-2; needs a good clean and new bathroom in room 5 - dont even bother with the breakfast (cheap and nasty!) 
-2; Booked over a week beforehand for the Victoria Grand Afternoon Tea. Said I had a nut allergy and hotel emailed asking if it was whole nuts or traces of nuts I was allergic too. Explained I was okay to eat traces of nuts so long as there were no whole nuts in the cakes. When we arrived we again said about the allergy and the waitress said she had that noted already. So I was completely taken aback when I was offered a bowl of fruit instead of cakes. I sais to the waiter that traces were okay and he very snootily took away the fruit and came back with the same cakes as my friend except the carrot cake with quite clearly had nuts in as you could see them. So why ask if I had an allergy to traces of nuts and then give me a bowl of fruit. Totally unacceptable and ruined a lovely day. 
-2; We took members of the family who live locally to the restaurant based on the reputation of the chef. The food was perfectly good although some it was borderline on being hot enough but the front of house was woeful. If you want to charge £50 a head for two courses then you place your establishment in a space where expectations of the quality of service are very high and the The Cornwall just does not deliver. Requests for something to accompany our pre-dinner drinks had to be made three times before it arrived. The waiting staff professed to have never heard of kir which at this level is surprising. The expresso was served in a cold cup so was only just warm enough by the time it reached the table. There are other restaurants nearby you should consider before going here if you are looking for value of money. If you want a smart restaurant which was very quiet on a Sunday night then you might want to overlook these issues. 
-2;Visited th Hilton, Gateshead this weekend and I feel very disappointed with the room and leisure centre. I was expecting river view roomm, only to be told on checking in that these rooms were already taken t  Leisure centre changing rooms were dirty with high piles of dirty towels in the middle of the floor.  Having to pay for car parking at the hotel was also insulting due to being residents at the hotel for 2 nights is criminal.  The location is great and a short stroll to the shops and bars.  I will not be staying here again as we strongly feel that it was not worth the money and value.
-2;" We booked a spa break. Dont bother. Lunch was poor at best. The room was average however the smell of sewage ruint the time we had in the room. We booked a table at 830 however they had over booked and we didnt have a table ee came to order but everything on the menu we wanted had &quot;sold out&quot; very strange. The service was a shambles. Then breakfast came we waited 15 minutes to be seated once we were we had cold food no fresh fruit it had all gone no bowls etc. Staff seem to be running round all evening and morning without a clue. The only saving grace was the two treatments we had the spa staff were great. Thinking of booking. I wouldn't. .. wont be back again "
-2; Let me start by saying that the staff were all without exception, lovely, polite friendly and professional. That's the good bit. I stayed here for 2 nights on business , but also due to its location for theatre land, and specifically booked an executive double quiet room due to being a poor sleeper. I suggest that the management stay for a night in room 701 and see if they can sleep with the huge, noisy and intrusive venting from the restaurant at the rear of the hotel. It was like sleeping next to a tractor all night and the view of the brick wall and venting about 10 yards away is really attractive. To charge nearly £ 300 per night for this privilege ( breakfast is a set £ 15 extra) is to add insult to injury. I usually find hotels too warm , but this was like sleeping in the tropics with the heat from the vents. So no sleep at all for 2 nights . Secondly, I usually like heritage style hotels and am a great lover of our beautiful buildings in this country. But..and for me it's a big but. Bathrooms need to be functional but modern .The bathroom In 701 is distinctly tired with an incredibly narrow bath, the horror of a plastic curtain and a shower over the bath. Not what i expect from a hotel charging what Kingsway Hall charge. No, I wont be coming back. Even though the staff were all lovely. 
-2; Luckily this was only a £70 overnight deal from Pru Health. There were 4 ladies in our group, two bedrooms. Bedrooms were OK. The facilities were pretty poor and outdated. We arrived and our treatments were booked in wrong. We couldn't book further treatments. The pool and jacuzzi were too cold to enjoy. No loungers to relax around the pool. The quiet room has poor acoustics and you can hear everything from pool/corridor area and there are not enough beds! The service is poor and drab throughout - restaurants, check-in, departure, treatments. We were not keen on the approach to alcohol - no bar, you can only order wine with a meal (and even them it is like getting blood from a stone), the wine list even lectures you on what damage the wine will do to you!! We had to wait about 15mins to check out! Oh and the free treatments were pretty bad - it seemed that the free treatments carried out by young students. Paid treatments were Ok. All in all, we won't be going back!! Such a shame, we were so looking forward to it. Must say, three members of staff shone through - the butler, nail technician and shop assistant. 
-2;I travel to London on business most weeks and as my usual hotel was not available they suggested I try the Radisson Blu. It may have been due to last minute booking but I think I got the tiniest room in the hotel - 552 - A tiny room with a big price £327.00!! Even though there was a desk there was not much room to work, you could only watch TV from sitting on the bed and the bathroom was really small. As the room was so small it was very hot but when I switched on the air cooling it was so noisy I had to switch it off. Any staff members I met were friendly but on departure I was not asked how my stay was if I had been I would have given feedback.
-2;We stayed here for 1 night which was part of a deal online. The deal was room, with use of spa and evening meal.   The best bit of the hotel I think is the outside and the gardens and the coffee - The gardens are lovely and looked so nice when we arrived in the sunshine. The americano I had after dinner was one of the best coffee I have tasted.   Sadly everything else was a little disappointing and nothing close to the other group hotels. We were upgraded to a suite which was darkly decorated, in need of an upgrade and possibly lighter decor. The bed was a twin tied together which then meant that we dipped down in the middle! The TV signal dropped a number of times and the units were quite worn.   Everything was very clean.   The hotel bar looked dated and had fake cocktails on the bar which totally put me off buying one. The bar prices were very high and the highest I think I have seen in a hotel - £13 for a 'tall' cocktail aka a mojito!! The top hotels in Bristol only charge £10 - £12 max and that is for more than a mojito.   The evening a la carte menu was OK - the fig starter was nice but the main not so good and the sides were £4 each... which again for what they were I thought was high. The restaurant again was dated, the table etc looked worn and in need of a freshen up. The staff are all very lovely and helpful.   Breakfast was OK and the pot of coffee nice. Staff at breakfast were again lovely.   I think we maybe found it more disappointing as we have been to the other group hotel Homewood Park which was very nice.
-2;" Avoid this hotel if you can. We paid £275 per room and it was far from a &quot;Luxury&quot; hotel: -My pillow case had holes on it -The sofa was stained  -The carpet was dirty -The breakfast/dinner seats were stained as well -They say that their breakfast is until 10am. However when we checked in they told us that the second and last sitting was at 8:30 and that we might need to eat &quot;in a rush&quot;. We woke up early on Sunday and had breakfast without any problems.  -We had dinner at their restaurant and they forgot to bring the wine with the food. When we order it again, they brought the wrong wine. It seems that they were short of staff, and they were a bit overwhelmed by the number of tables.  -There were 2 receptionists but they could only attend 1 client at a time! -They have DVDs to borrow, but when we asked the receptionist, she said that she needed the manager. After waiting 20 minutes, they gave us an old DVD player and the film wasn't even working.   On the plus side the decoration is great, the breakfast was ok, the people at reservations are nice and the staff at the restaurant was very nice and apologetic. It seems more a management issue, but I'm not an expert.   As I said, for a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel, it lacks lots of details. Having a great decoration it just not enough. Next time we will try another place. "
-2; Stayed at Hilton St Anne's in Bracknell for two nights on business and would never stay there again. Room service food was shockingly poor, not at all reflecting their charges which were quite expensive. Cheap produce, poorly prepared, completely tasteless - overall horrid. 
-2; Booked a suite in September for a weekend in October. Arrived and was told no parking available. Was also told where the room was but not shown. When we saw the room it was dreadful a suite with not even a chair in the room. This hotel is faulsley advertising it was a total dump. Went to reception to tell them and was told okay we will refund the room booking. My advice give this dreadful hotel a miss. 
-2;I was given a Spabreaks voucher for two as a birthday gift for this hotel/spa and was looking forward to a nice quiet, relaxing day away from the stresses and strains of everyday life, together with the family member who gave me the voucher. How disappointed we were – if we had known what to expect she would have chosen another venue. The list of our complaints is as follows: No heating in the building due to ongoing problems awaiting attention – we are of the opinion we should have been informed of this beforehand and given the chance to re-book. The changing room was very small  Although the massage we chose was very enjoyable and relaxing, the coldness of the room, together with the higher than necessary volume of the music, did spoil the experience somewhat. The “relaxation room” we used after our treatments was very small and cold, although the limited seating was comfortable and blankets/throws were available to use. It became very busy with clients who were noisy and intrusive on our “rest period”.  The very small and almost claustrophobic changing room (no windows) we were told to use was in an unpleasant, dirty condition, even before 10 o’clock in the morning, with two rubbish bins and a sanitary bin overflowing with various items, including an old banana skin! The toilet bowl was stained and when we opened another door, expecting it to be another toilet, we found a small shower, complete with human hair scattered around and dirty stains around the door stop behind the door. Although there were plenty of spare toilet rolls, the tissue box was empty and the one and only hand towel available was already dirty and wet – very unhygienic! When we eventually gained access to the pool, (having been taken and left at the fire exit by a member of staff and had to be let in by the swimming instructor), it was already occupied by several families with young children who were shouting and screaming as they jumped in the water, splashing anyone within their vicinity. Nearly half of the pool was cordoned off so that children’s swimming lessons could take place, resulting in very little space left for anyone who was hoping to exercise by swimming. Although the pool was comfortably warm, we gave up trying to swim and managed to squeeze ourselves into the crowded Jacuzzi, where we spent the next forty five minutes being warmed through by the hot water – the warmest part of our entire visit! Lunch was a very pleasant experience in the café bar, although it was very busy and noisy with golfers, residents and other guests. The food we chose was generous in portion size and very enjoyable but unfortunately our break for afternoon tea was not. The noise coming from the café bar as we approached it was absolutely deafening as it was filled with noisy, beer-drinking golfers and other guests.  On our way back from the café bar, we passed the pool once again and all our plans for another attempt at swimming before we left at the end of the day were immediately shattered. By now, all the families and children previously occupying the pool and Jacuzzi had been replaced by several young couples who were doing more kissing and cuddling than swimming, so we decided enough was enough and we would pack up and go home where we would shower in the warmth and comfort of our own homes. On leaving the spa, the young lady on reception merely wished us goodbye and didn’t ask if we had enjoyed our day and if we were happy with everything (as we would have expected). Because of this we decided to make our complaints afterwards, leaving the Marriott Forest of Eden thoroughly disappointed and vowing never to return.  Only one good thing has come from this experience – in future we will take more care to research the venues for spa days before booking and avoid this one at all costs!
-2; weekend treat for a special birthday. Location good. Room shabby, facing out onto Bloomsbury street, so very noisey even on the 4th floor. Air conditioning noisey. Breakfast poor. came back after seeing a lovely show and had a drink in the bar, two Baileys £18.46! On the up side, staff could not have been nicer. On the whole i think you would of got better value from a premiur Inn. I always hate moaning reviews but poor quality when the price is by no means cheap is equally unacceptable. 
-2; Oh dear, oh dear, 25 years ago this place would be buzzing, now its just a bit sad. Decor and furniture need upgrading but will cost so much I can't see the investment ever being made. Place was quiet to say the least, staff attentive as happy to actually be asked to do something. Bed very comfortable, nice sheets and towels. Large room which was nice if not full of shabby furniture!  Window didn't shut very well so was drafty but the radiator pumped out enough heat to keep the room warm and did get woken up by an loud blackbird but can't really compain about the wildlife!  Breakfast adequate and good standard, was a buffet style which we found odd as with so few guests there must be a lot of wastage and would be better off cooked fresh to order.  For £74 inc breakfast it was ok value for a 1 night stay.  We walked to the Dukes Head pub at the roundabout for supper as the restaurant was empty at the hotel so lacking in atmosphere. Only took 5 mins and was a complete contrast! 
-2; I stayed at this hotel last weekend. The rooms are ok, nothing special. The saving grace is the location and it's surroundings, quite pretty. However, don't eat there! They could'nt even cope with breakfast - and that's a buffet.  They kept running out of hot food, brought it up in dribs and drabs. Useless. I dread to think what the quality of food and service would be like if they had to actually provide a meal and wait table. 
-2; - Not enough information on arrival, e.g. no code number for outside door - advertised three hole golf course (on web and in hotel guest booklet) does not exist, which the receptionist did not seem to know as she told us where to look for it - room dusty in places, stained duvet without duvet cover, slightly stained sheet - Complaints not dealt with satisfactorily, e.g., apparently it is not policy to use duvet covers or replace stained duvets or sheets - Leisure Centre has no supervision - Health and Safety issue? - Restaurant - service poor, breakfast buffet very sparse, ran out of several basics, meal times poor 
-2; Some friends stayed in Braby block. We paid considerably more for Freshwater block. But Braby block had been refurbished earlier this year and there was very little difference between the two blocks. So - don't book Standard Plus, just go with Standard. 
-2; 7 of us booked in to have cocktails in cloud 23 Had to pay a small deposit first which is then deducted of the final bill ( not forgetting service charge). Brilliant service and great cocktails. Unfortunately the bar staff didn't take off the deposit so 29 days later we are still waiting for it to be transferred back to us. Bad end to a great night unfortunately. 
0; Overpriced for a hotel that hosts some fabulous weddings, sadly the rest of the hotel doesn't live up to those such events. The room was tired, creaky floorboards, sad looking furniture. Breakfast extortionate at £15.50 each after paying upwards of £100 for one night. Excellent butchers a walk away and yet poor quality sausage and bacon. A good nights sleep but very hot room. No porter at desk beyond midnight so tricky to get in after a night out. Staff also unsure of check out times, staff at reception offered no advice at time of check in. Disappointed. 
0; Stayed here for one night lovely location but having checked into our room we found that there were no beds for the children, having asked reception they said we were given the wrong room, there was a knock on the door and a couple from a different room came to tell us they had our room which should have been done by the staff as we did not have their room. Our room was large and very clean although only had enough cups for 3 and there was 4 of us, nice to see sweets out for the children, nice extra touch. Not happy that there were no changing facilities for the pool and don't understand why they would want people walking through the hotel in swimwear wet or dry. Pool was really cold and the children would not use it let alone us. Twice asked for information on sister hotel and had to go find out ourselves. At a 165 pound a night felt this was too much for such limited facilities. 
0; Booked a room with a Park view, well just about if your room was above tree height! Lots of noise from builders in rooms on the same floor as us - floor 8 which was very annoying when we where trying to have a rest in the afternoon before a long night out.  Room tired, basin drain took forever.   Positives, very clean and the bed was lovely and comfy.   Should have been advised of refurbishments when checking in.  Breakfast included in price was ok, but cooked breakfast items not very hot. 
0; We (2 adults + 4 children) stayed here the night before a wedding in Farnham. I chose this hotel as I had hilton honours points to use so we paid £25 in total for 2 family rooms (breakfast not included). I read the reviews before we arrived and was a bit apprehensive about the hotel. When we arrived, reception couldn't have been more welcoming, helpful and friendly. They had accomadated our request of having the two rooms together which was a good start. The rooms were clean and tidy albeit a bit dated (it looks as though some rooms were in the process of being done up though). The room was very peaceful and quiet. We paid just under £10 each for the two adults for breakfast then all four children ate free. Good selection and really friendly speedy service. The swimming pool was lovely and clean. All in all the children loved it and this Hilton was consistent with most others I've stayed in. Staff that were particularly attentive were Adrian (?) on reception and the breakfast manager. Thank you for a relaxing stay 
0; Firstly i would like to commend and thank the CHEFS at the hotel,for a really enjoyable evening meal...The breakfast also had so much to offer and all of good quality.10/10. The grounds also were stunning..as was the building and location for touring or walking Devon..... But as with the other reviews for this hotel a lot of the bedrooms are areal LET DOWN!!! ITCHY ORANGE BLANKETS!!! I havent stayed in a hotel with theese. for 20yrs!! I know some rooms here have been modernised and do have duvets and suggest you insist on one of theese on booking.. My initial room a single 131 was like the servants quarters...i was welcomed by a half drunk cup of tea on the side covered in mould...and rubbish from it in the bin...i took this down to reception where i spoke with totally disinterested manager!!! who merely said he would pass the complaint onto housekeeping!! He spoke to me like i was an idiot and said it could not have been there more than 24hrs!!! Having worked in the food indusry all my life i know it had to have been sat there for a week or more!!!! Later as i went to dress for dinner...I found there to be a Big problem with the curtains closing....reception was very good and imediately had a lovely helpfull Scottish gentleman come to my assistance...Though he ran up and down stairs getting ladders and allsorts to rectify the problem it was to no avail...i had to change rooms to room 347 it was a lovely refurbished room...with crisp white sheets and a DUVET!!!!.. and curtains that worked..it was LOVELY... My mother and sister shared room309.. a twin with BLANKETS!! they had paid for an upgrade the week before...an upgrade from what i dread to think!! Many of the waiters and bar staff here were not English spoken trainees which made it difficult to speak with or request anything from them.... The bar was like a morgue...totally quiet with no music...or atmosphere.. 
0; My room was lovely. Clean, cosy and all the amenities I could possibly want. Room service a call away and a stones throw from the train station. I even requested a room in one of the lower ground floors as I don't like lifts and they put me on the first floor as requested. All perfect - until night time.. Very poor sound proofing in my room meant for a sleepless night. I am not sure if all the rooms are like this, or whether I was unlucky on this occasion. 
0; I would have given a higher rate on this Hilton branch if not for some small things that I feel can be improved.  Staff were friendly and helpful. The food for breakfast was very good, lots of selections. Bed is nice and comfy buy I didn't like the pillow. I constantly need to adjust it so I didn't get a good night sleep. The lock on the toilet door is also broken. I wanted to write a note but the pen in the room was broken. There is also no glasses in the toilet. The cost we paid was not cheap so we were expecting our money's worth. We stayed in room 557. Hopefully management will read this review. 
0; Stayed here for one night before a conference. It was OK but didn't really seem up to standard. The room was a bit small but nicely furnished and the bathroom was a good size. However both could have done with a really deep clean and in fact I asked for my bathroom to be cleaned as the toilet seat was dirty and there was toothpaste around the sink. This was sorted out fine but I also queried why the radio didn't work from the TV entertainment screen and was told it was broken and I could change rooms if I wanted. I didn't bother as I wasn't going to be there long but I'm glad I didn't as my colleague said his radio didn't work either. Breakfast was disappointing. Coffee and fruit was good but the cooked breakfast I think had been sat on the hot plates too long. The only way I can describe the scrambled egg is unpleasant, the bacon was like cardboard and the sausages were OK but an unusal type to serve for breakfast! The baked beans were good! 
0; We did not stay in this hotel but went for a spa day and afternoon tea. The spa reception staff were pleasant but did not give us a induction. My husband had to ask for help with the fitness machines and then was only shown two. The sauna had no water to splash on the hot stones, so the room just got hotter and hotter (only stay in there for a few minutes). The Jacuzzi had a list on the wall to give all the do's and don'ts but no information as to where to switch it on - there is a plastic push button on the opposite wall for anyone interested - we only found it by watching others use it. We met another couple there who had come with the same package as ourselves and they had not had any induction either.  The lack of induction is not a 5* package, your health is very important when using these spas they can be very dangerous. We kept expecting one of the staff to come and speak to us but this did not happen even though there were two on duty but they stayed by the reception desk chatting. The very least they should have done was to ask if we had used a spa before and so know what to do. When I left I had a word with the young lady who just could not see how dangerous it could be to some people and she just kept repeating that we should have asked for an induction when we booked our day. But if you did not know one was not forthcoming how could you have booked it!! The afternoon tea is served in the bar with only one young man to do everything. When he is in the area at the back of the bar you have to wait for him to appear. The sandwiches and cakes were delicious but the lettuce was definitely passed its best. All in all perhaps a 3* experience. 
0;"Visited the Spa with 2 friends for a bit of relaxation. I have to say that I thought the facilities themselves were extremely dated, they looked tatty and unclean on the whole. The changing rooms have also seen better days. Whole place could do with a bit of 'doing up!' Sauna and steam room were both very small, often too full to be able to go in. Aside from this, we did enjoy our day there, every staff member we encountered could not have been more pleasant or helpful. 2 of us had treatments, I opted for the hot stone massage which was wonderful, and my friend enjoyed her treatment just as much. The lady (can't remember her name; I want to say Penny?) was very professional, explained everything to me as i'd not had this particular treatment before, then afterwards gave me great advice on specific back issues I have. We all left feeling extremely relaxed and rejuvenated, ready to face the kids again!"
0; Went for mid-morning coffee on Valentine's Day. Friendly staff. Lovely cappucino and herbal tea. However, for February the air-conditioning fans were turned up high and this gave the place a cold feeling. I asked the waiter if he could turn them off, which he did and it warmed up a little. Lovely spot to take coffee and read the paper and relax. Would pop in for coffee again sometime. 
0; Upon arrival (approx 50mins after the stated check-in time) we were told that our allocated room was not yet ready for check in. We were given another room but upon entering it my partner and I discovered two single beds pushed together with two single duvets after having booked a double room. We were told at reception that pushing single beds together is entirely normal, which may well be the case but does not make for a comfortable nights sleep (unless you like sleeping on the other side of the bed from your partner!!!) We requested a double duvet which they agreed to but it never showed up - we were later told by housekeeping that they didn't have any.  On our second evening, just as we were getting ready to go out for dinner at around 6pm housekeeping knocked on the door, very quietly, waited about 5 seconds and then let herself in to clean the room. We weren't really expecting this as most hotels clean in the mornings, so she was lucky we were decent and almost ready. She said that we were her last room so she either did it then or didn't do it. We asked her to wait for 10 mins which she agreed to and we went out and left her to it.  Overall I can't say that this is hotel is anything special. The front of house staff are pleasant but nothing more, and service isn't up to much. Small things like no plug sockets near the bedside tables and drawers coming loose aren't a big deal but add to discomfort. I think it's a case of a hotel trying to be something it isn't. A real shame but I won't be returning. 
0; Stay at the Macdonald was fine, good breakfast and service bright and cheerful. Room was spacious and bright although very hot!  The bed was a bit lumpy and there was no access to earplugs to mask the loud traffic noise. Also, oddly there was no soap or face clothes. 
0; I chose this hotel as it advertised itself as being associated with Marco Pierre White. This, I thought, should mean good quality, well presented and good service.  We were placed in an executive double room in the new treetops building. Beware! There is no lift for this 3 storey building and, whilst clean and fresh, the fittings and finishes are poor.... Thin walls, receding bath sealant and squeaky stairs. The grounds surrounding the old building were beautiful and well kept and clearly perfect for weddings however there is a large amount of building work going on across the rest of the grounds and the grounds around the building I stayed in were neglected and part bare. The staff were friendly and helpful but I, and other guests commented on the lack of staff at breakfast leading to us clearing tables so that we could sit down.  I wouldn't stay here again unless I was in the old building.  
0; Its a hard one to call! Overall we had a nice time, the hotel is old fashioned and dated, the jacuzzi has tiles missing, the pool is small and I spotted black bits floating around..its carpeted, old slow lift... We had a suite, £190 a night, two rooms in one. The tv, bath, shower were old. The size was good. Carpet is old, crumbs under the sofa. Pop up unsafe beds for the kids. One day we went pool and they cleaned our room, my husband left his wallet on the bed (bad move) and £80 was missing, whilst we can not be 100% sure it was the cleaner..we never did find that money and it was only day 2 of the holiday so we knew exactly what we had spent. Staff are good, helpful, one red-head lady slightly rude and stressed out and one lady with long black hair and goth type earring I caught her sniggering in the mirror reflection with her friend as I walked past her - jealously maybe?! Not professional given the money we were spending.. Breakfast was yummy. Gardens are pretty. Quiet not too busy/rowdy.  I wouldn't go again... 
0;Staff just seemed not interested apart from a lovely lady in the living well health suite. There was no real customer service. Premier Inn staff certainly are better trained. Wouldn't pay for the quality of Hilton again if this is the what they offer.  Breakfast service was the worst. Toaster jammed so toast disappeared into a black hole. No clean tables upon arrival. Only 3 staff visible inc a manager who never lifted a finger to try & keep the place a little tidier. No orange juice available, 3 empty bottles of brown sauce( therefore no brown sauce), no staff to ask for things. Was not impressed by the whole experience at all.  Room was ok, mattress a little lumpy but nice and spacious room.
0;" This stay was courtesy of Tesco Clubcard coupons so I didn't expect a top class room and I wasn't disappointed. The room was adequate for a weekend but my husband and I wouldn't have wanted to spend a week's holiday in it. The TV was suffering from technical problems, no BBC1 except for with subtitles nor were several other channels available. This probem was throughout the hotel but nobody seemed in any hurry to fix it. The room was clean as was the bathroom but through the hotel it was the small things that didn't receive attention - hospitality tray in the bedroom wasn't refreshed each day as items were used (although the toiletries in the bathroom were); at breakfast on two mornings there was neither milk nor marmalade on the table and these had to be requested. On the last morning breakfast ended at 10am but at 9.15am the fried eggs had run out and I was told that there wouldn't been any more as the fryer had broken down! I would have expected the member of staff to offer the chef preparing me a fried egg as I wished, not the blanket statement that there wouldn't be any more eggs that day. How can a large frying pan over heat break down? Another gripe is that there wasn't free wifi unless you were in a certain category of room or at a conference. This practice seems to be not just with the Hilton we stayed in but throughout Hilton hotels in the UK. Most hotels now offer free wifi as a matter of course. We would return again for a weekend but if I was paying the full price, I would choose another hotel in Bracknell rather than this one. "
0; We stayed here for 2 nights after finding a good deal online & having stayed here 2 years ago & really enjoyed the welcome, the location & a river view room. Our room this time was lovely albeit noisy on the Friday night due to passing stag/hen dos. The first time we stayed we were greeted by friendly & informative staff with info on breakfast, the offer of a paper, even a glass of wine & assistance with our bags which made our stay feel a bit more special. If we hadn't have stayed previously maybe the complete lack of interest by the reception staff wouldn't have been notable but it really made a difference to our stay having had such a good experience last time. 
0;" Well what can I say.....I had booked this weekend away for a special time with my daughter. The hotel is conveniently located between where we both live (Surrey & West Sussex), easy to find and lots of parking. Checked in – not the warmest of welcomes and what seemed to be three members of staff discussing something contentious (not a good first impression). The room was fairly large; we had requested single beds and had lots of room. The bed linen was lovely (and we slept really well whilst there for two nights). Upon entering the room there was a strong unpleasant smell, the drains really needed some bleach – we thought all of the perfumes and creams would diffuse the smell, but sadly they did not. We had dinner in the Baytree restaurant, we had a £25 allowance and the choices were more than adequate, however the chef did not seem to understand that neither of us liked capers and twice my daughter’s starter came our wrong – with capers, by which time I had eaten my very tasty ravioli starter. We were then asked if we would like more bread, when we had not been offered any! Our main courses were delicious but service seemed very disorganised and lacking in management at all. Breakfast was super with lots of ‘self service’ choice, no complaints. The first two spa treatments (Massage & Facial) were totally relaxing, then we went into the over crammed spa area, it was absolutely packed with virtually no bed space and lots of noise. Guests were drinking alcohol and were rather loud, the pool was really busy, the Jacuzzi at one stage had at least 12 people crammed into the small area and there were queues for the sauna and steam rooms. I was totally shocked when a lady (staff I assumed as she was fully dressed) walked through the wet area in high black wedged heel shoes without the normal plastic blue protectors; she filled up the water bucket for the sauna then walked out! (is this normal?). Not the most relaxing or spa break....but the treatment staff were lovely. We decided to have room tray service for dinner as we really wanted to relax...firstly the TV did not work so we had to call to have an engineer come to the room to resolve. Dinner arrived and the waitress accidentally knocked the glass of Coke all over my fries (which I ate and they were very tasty) as the burger I ordered appeared to be full of capers (which I hate) I did not eat it. My daughter ordered a pasta dish which was lovely, but they forgot the chicken, so the waitress went back to the kitchen to collect a portion...we had to laugh.  We then settled in for a relaxing evening in front of the now working ‘flickering’ tv. At some stage during the evening something had knocked out all of the lights as we woke up to total darkness and had to call reception to ‘send a man up’. We checked out, surprise surprise, the bill was wrong...overall we were not happy. Nice hotel, nice spa, nice food but in my opinion poor management – sorry! "
0;"Just got back from a 3 night stay at Hyatt. I read the other reviews and if this is the best hotel in Birmingham as some reviews suggest then it is worrying..... First glitch was that despite of the mention of £12 per 24 hours charge for car park on the website and the confirmation e-mail I had received from the hotel reservations, there is no car park. On my arrival the concierge asked me to drop my things off quickly and go and park in a public car park....After a long day at NEC setting up our exhibition stand, that was the last thing I wanted to hear. He directed me to a multistorey opposite of the hotel and I was not even allowed to check in first put my stuff in the room and come back and take the car to the car park. On the way to the multistorey concierge directed me to, I spotted another public car park under Crowne Plaza as it's just round the corner and much closer than the one concierge told me to go to, but I was stopped and asked where I was staying, as soon as I said Hyatt, I was told that I could not park there. When I asked why they said &quot;ask Hyatt why??&quot; When I mentioned this at the check in, the check in lady didn't seem to want to talk about it much, she said we have an allocation, it must have been full...but she was not convincing....so I think there's something going on between the two hotels.  Room was nice and spacious but the carpet was heavily soiled in parts and the bathroom tiles need regrouting in parts. I had to pay £15 for internet access and was charged £15 for the breakfast I didn't have so always check your bills! Had a room service sandwich on the first night as I was so knackered after driving around trying to park my car in a public car park, but the sandwich was expensive, cold, not nice at all.   Bed was large and comfortable with very clean sheets and fluffy pillows but that's all. Overall, it an expensive hotel and ok but nothing special.......It's right in the heart of the city so if you want a quiet night's sleep, I would suggest that you stay somewhere else as I was on the 18th floor but could still hear the noise from bars and clubs around 3 am! It's 15 -20 mins to walk to New Street train station."
0; Having spent time via email going back and forth booking a Christmas treat for work colleagues, ensuring we would be in a festive room with atmosphere (as a party of 10 could not be accommodated in the orangery) I was extremely disappointed to arrive to find that no-one was expecting us!  Dispite 4 receptionist staffing over the computer it took me to take control and seat my party in the main hall while we waited for the issue to be resolved. No drinks were offered while we waited. Finally someone took us to our room for afternoon tea as booked. More disappointment...the room was drab the table huge so conversation across it was difficult there was almost no one in the orangery so no idea why we couldn't have been seated there.  The afternoon tea was more disappointment as the bread was stale and the service was poor. I did not make a fuss in front of the team as it was wonderful their treat but it didn't feel very rewarding.  For 7 days after I waited to hear from the booking team with an apology but heard nothing. Finally I wrote an email detailing our experience which the manager responded to immediately with a phone call. She was extremely apologetic and understanding of our disappointment and promised an email to confirm her promise of afternoon tea for my whole team in the summer on the terrace. A generous offer but no email has appeared as yet.  I have rated this hotel average as I believe that in setting such as this average is well below par.  We have a booking to spend boxing day here with friends lets hope it's a better experience. 
0; This hotel had some great points: The food in the restaurant is amazing!  Therapists in the spa were excellent Certain members of staff  Comfy beds  Great location  However, it also had some really steep lows.   The first room we were given had an awful smell (this smell cropped up through out the stay) I think there was a problem with the drains. The guy at reception was really good and moved us to a room that didn't smell. The rooms were ample, lots of space just a little dated, it's not luxury.   Like I said the food was amazing but with a good meal you want good wine, you can have this but in a small dirty glass.  We ordered Irish coffee after our meal and they can with gone off cream on top. They changed the drinks for us but did not even apologise let alone take the drinks off the bill.   The treatments in the spa were great as the therapist were brilliant however, the spa is directly next to the gym and through out a chilled massage all you can hear is heavy banging from the treadmill or weights, I kind of spoils your retreat.   If you are looking for a couple of days away with out paying to much I would recommend this place, we had a great time. If your expecting a luxury spa hotel you will be disappointed. 
0;Stayed one night for business conference. Room was very old-fashioned, but clean and comfortable. Food for breakfast and dinner was excellent.
0; Made welcome by the reception staff who were very polite on arrival.  The executive room was as advertised clean and tidy. The negative things as follows - the toilet was very slow to flush and had to be flushed twice each time it was used, sadly the bed was very very soft, too soft in fact and we both had back ache in the morning. We went down to breakfast in the morning and had to ask where to go as we had not been informed when we checked in the evening before. I understand the hotel was very busy when we checked in though. The breakfast was average, it might be nice to offer vegetarian sausage as an alternative for veggies. 
0; As we stayed here this time last year and didn't have to bad a time we decided to stay again this year. Unfortunately what a difference a year can make. Don't get me wrong, the location is great, there is parking and all but the head of breakfast, who didn't even speak to us, the staff are very helpful and friendly. We did stay in the basic room. However, all that said it did not warrant its price tag, you get better value at a Premium Inn. The room was very old and tatty although clean. I did have to request my bed spread be changed as it was dirty and there was a loose tile on the bathroom floor that needed to be re grouted. Both things done whilst I was out, good customer service there. Other issues that can to light where the toilet seat would not stay up for gentleman users and the main entry door lock kept sticking on. The bed was comfortable and we did sleep ok. On arriving for breakfast there was no one to greet us and nothing to say please wait to be seated, so we sat down. Whilst getting something to eat the head of breakfast did stare at us but said nothing. There was a nice variety of choices for breakfast and it was very nice.   On checking out I was asked if we had enjoyed our stay. I advised of the issues we had and gave our opinion on the state of the room. The trainee staff member apologized however the staff member who took the payment just thanked me for letting them know.   I would have thought with all the issues we had had there might have been a small gesture of goodwill, ie remove car parking fee, nope nothing.   Would we recommend or stay again at this hotel, sadly not. 
0; The hotel lobby was nicely decorated and the staff were friendly enough. The doubletree cookies on arrival are always a bonus! Another plus is the fantastic location just behind oxford street, so perfect if you are looking for a shopping trip.  The room we stayed in was priced at just under £200 per night which I thought was very pricey for the tiny box room! Just enough room for double bed and a desk, and the bed was a small double which we both just laughed at the size! Luckily we didn't pay full price but had we have done I'd be more disappointed! 
0; Stayed at sopwell for a work meeting. Stayed in the Mews rooms which were meant to be an 'upgrade' but I wouldn't call it that. I thought that the rooms were very dated. The room was large and the bed was comfy but felt a little basic.  We did have a BBQ and the food was great, a really good selection and was delicious.  Breakfast was also good too with a variety to chose from. 
0;from outside hotel promises a lot, reception looks nice too but the room wakes You up from the dream...when I arrived in the hotel found my reservation out cancelled by the receptionist because my card was declined coz I didn't manage pay money in to the bank, well it happens if You are busy person. After around 15 minutes Me and my partner been given another room for a same price. Key to the room didn't work which was annoying. the room was very hot, we didn't sleep well, it was very loud too. around 8 am fire alarm went on for no reason...breakfast that we had delivered to the room was very bad presented and was far from a good taste. Bathroom had no space for our personal items. Hotel does charge for a wifi, I don't know exactly how much coz I stayed there only one night and been using my own data. Well if You decide to say there get some earplugs...
0; After reading such great reviews we thought we would try a stay at this hotel because we are fans of the Hilton brand   We planned to arrive around 2.30pm, there was a match on at the stadium kick off was at 3pm so there was traffic hold ups on all roads. If you intend to say here then check to see iff there is an event on at the stadium it will save you time sitting in traffic. The Hotel is great and brand new and offers free car parking however there are some downsides so I thought  We had an executive room overlooking the roof top of the gym and facing a housing estate. The room was nice but the bathroom was very small We decided to have a pre dinner drink at the hotel and the only table that was available was full of empty food plates and it was not cleared even after 40 mins  To get served at the bar would take you at least 20 mins and then you would find out that they had run out of the drink that you wanted  The staff are new as well so things don't run smoothly  We decided to have a relaxing swim in the morning only to find that the pool was full of sceaming toddlers  The gym is really well equipped so that is a plus  Breakfast was very busy and service was slow 
0; We stayed here in a suite and it was pleasant. The staff were very nice and helpful but the room was very dated and really not worth the money being charged. It was furnished with very old (but not valuable in my opinion) mismatched furniture where drawers didn't fit and nothing seemed to gel. The windows were in dire need of a clean especially as the sea view was wonderful. The bed was clean and comfy and the towels were very nice. Food was OK but we found afternoon tea disappointing. Sandwiches were nice and fresh but the scones were not freshly made and who wants old scones or microwaved scones? And the cakes were slabs!! Nothing delicate about them. Breakfast had its own peculiarity. On the menu it states 'fruit plate' or something similar. One fruit plate was put out with a serving for one. There was a paucity of fruit to say the least! The cooked breakfast was very good but the buffet was sadly lacking. Where were the rolls? Nice to visit but very expensive in my view. A week here for one would get me 2 weeks at a 5 star establishment abroad. Sorry........ 
0; My fiance booked us in for an overnight spa break at this hotel on 40th birthday. The booking included 2 half hour spa treatments which he booked for 2pm. Before we arrived we were sent a list of treatments. My fiance asked if i could have one 50 minute treatment instead of the two half hour treatments (the overall cost was £15 less) but he was told no. I had never been to a spa before and was looking forward to it. We arrived at the spa at 2.04pm after checking in at the hotel and i expected to be greeted with congratulations as my fiance had made a point of saying it was my birthday and then be given a robe and slippers before being taken down to each treatment individually. There was no mention of my birthday, no offer of a drink and no fluffy robe or slippers like you see in the pictures. Instead i was asked to take a seat and fill in a form. When i had completed the form i had to sit and wait before being taken into a room and was asked to take off my top and shoes then lie on the bed. Again i had to wait. It was 2.25pm by this time the lady came in to give me my treatments and i was told because i was late she wouldn't have time to complete both treatments. During the treatment the lady never spoke and i was never told what was about to happen or what was being applied eg, this is a hot flannel, so i actually found the experience quite scarey. At exactly 3pm a bell chimed and that was the treatment over and i was offered some flavored water and left to get dressed. The lady then came back with a card showing what products had been used on my face and what she recommended for me. A small kit would cost around £180. I was quite angry at this as i hadn't received the full treatments and now they were trying to sell me their products. Maybe if the spa told customers at the time of booking they would need to arrive early, i would not have been so upset. My fiance was waiting for me when i came out and we went over to the hotel. We went up to our room and i thought maybe the hotel would have left a complimentary glass of wine or a card to wish me happy 40th but there was nothing. At 5.30pm we went down for our evening meal and i thought surely the waiter/waitress will wish me happy birthday but nothing. My fiance had picked this hotel out of hundreds and made a real point of informing everyone it was my 40th birthday and the hotel did nothing to acknowledge it. This was a real disappointment. Last year, the small hotel i booked us into for my fiances 40th made a real fuss and gave him a birthday to remember. They left complimentary chocolates and prosecco in the room and bough him a cake with candles and sang to him. On a plus the staff were polite and the food was lovely but we will not be coming back. 
0; I chose this hotel because of the excellent reviews combined with a decent price on the Saturday night I needed to stay over.  Let me start with what I liked. On arrival the building looks quite modern and a couple of stories high. It is situated in a nice quiet area next to a small golf course and has ample parking on site. The decor in the reception area & restaurant is very nice and gives a classy first impression of the hotel. The rooms are equally well presented with a comfortable furnishings & amenities such as ample power sockets, tea & coffee facilities, a good number of lighting alternatives, wall mounted flat screen tv, hiardryer, toiletries and towels The free wifi (which should be standard in all hotels in my opinion) is good and strong. The bed was comfortable, bathroom functional if small and heating easily controlled.  The things that let it down in my opinion could easily be rectified with a little effort. Firstly customer services could be better. I feel that the majority of the staff I came into contact with needed to be more cheery and welcoming ... maybe this had something to do with a lot of them seeming to be quite young. I feel it is so important that staff make their guests comfortable from the moment they arrive to the moment they leave. I stayed at the Ramada in Telford last weekend and the staff were ever so welcoming. I also noticed that every time I came to the reception area there seemed nobody out on the desk but instead they were behind in a little room. There was no bell to push and so you just had to wait until someone appeared.  I was initially issued room 211 but after a couple of minutes in what was a very nice room I could not stand that the wooden floor boards under the carpet creaked like crazy. I would have pitied the poor person below. I asked for a room change and was told by the girl on reception that I was being upgraded which made me happy but surprised me. However on entering room 252 it seemed exactly like the last one minus the creaking floors !! Surely that wasn't the reason used to say it was an upgrade !!  On the journey to each of the rooms I mentioned I noticed that the corridors had finished trays of food and empty bottles dotted around outside various rooms.... even the one I had the new key for. They seemed to be cleared away shortly afterwards.  Having said the above I enjoyed my stay, 
0;Rooms were lovely comfy and clean. Ideal location for shopping or going to see a show. Not good for disabled people due to stairs on entrance. Food was not so good. Service was not to bad. Would stay at again.    
0; We stayed here for a few days over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day our package was £730 DBB. We where pleasantly suprised at the surroundings of the hotel as it seemed very nice. The Room we where in was well furnished and bed comfortable bathroom clean. The only down side was the under floor heating wasnt working as you can imagine spending all this money to be told our room was cold wasnt very good. This was rectified by the porter bringing a portable radiator for us. Still wasnt to good though. The library restaurant is where we ate most of our meals. The food was excellent and the staff were ok. When we first arrived the staff at reception where ok but not to freindly which was dissapointing on first contact with this hotel. Everything went ok for the meals then when i tried to find staff on Christmas day evening I was dismaded to find anyone as no staff where about on reception. So defintely a lack of staff on christmas evening. The next day on boxiing day in the library restaurant i had to ask the waiting staff for tea, coffee , juice after a lengthy wait at the table. To be honest I feel they need to train there staff more. I enjoyed my stay the best I could after a expensive trip but wont be going back. 
0; Our room (number 23) was fine, but it was a considerable hike up and down steep stairs (no lift) and along very tired, cold and shabby corridors to get there. The bar was well furnished, but the prices were ridiculously high. When I asked for snacks (peanuts or crisps), since it was late and we hadn't had time for dinner, I was told that they had nothing because the chef was looking for a new supplier - he could have stepped out to the Co-op store a few yards away and bought in a supply quite easily. Breakfast was served quite quickly and was hot, but my 'full Yorkshire' came with half a mushroom (yes, one HALF mushroom, that's all) and one tiny rasher of bacon, along with a sausage, half a small tomato and 2 eggs (but only because I asked for two). It all only covered a small portion of the plate. I note that other reviewers have said the same, and the same about the bar prices - the hotel is obviously not listening! The B&B price was as high as we pay in South Kensington, central London at the Copthorne Tara, but there we get a decent sized breakfast and a lift to our room, along with pleasant decor. In other words The Black Swan is seriously overpriced and certainly NOT a boutique hotel. It needs to up its game and/or lower its prices. 
0; This is the second time I have been at this hotel for a conference. Setting is good, bedrooms ok but nothing special. Bathroom had the tiniest corner shower ever. The bar area is good and conference facilities ok but don't expect quality food. 
0;" Came here a couple of weeks ago and was not &quot;wowed&quot; if you know what I mean Restaurant is at the bottom of some steep stairs and not being as young as I used to, found it difficult, yet no staff helped me or my friends. The food was ok, but slow service, but the surroundings and buildings are beautiful "
0; We took advantage of the Autumn package on offer and stayed for a two night break.This proved to be good value for money and the room had amazing views across the bay.Some parts of the hotel look tired but overall we were impressed by the friendly and well trained staff which made up for it.We are very local to the hotel but have stayed over the years and can recommend it.One continuing gripe is the £7 per night parking charge.  
0; If you like the old style decor then this hotel is for you, it is done out well and our rooms was spacious although very warm but the bathroom was very basic and had a bad smell.  If booking on a deal be careful as we were unable to eat in the restaurant as it was full due to high demand although they won't tell you this when you book. Also be cautious when taking out membership for the Puma Hotels as the discounts that come with the membership are not applicable to most things. The leisure facilities and spa treatments are good.  Before booking on a weekend check to see if any weddings are taking place as this was the case when we arrived and the noise was very loud (not quite relaxing!) although luckily it did not last into the night. Location is very good as its a short walk into Harrogate town. 
0; My partner and I decided to stay here on Saturday 9th February to celebrate Valentines Day a few days early as he was going away the following week. When we arrived at about 11.30am our room was ready which was great as it meant we could drop off our bags before heading into the city centre for a wander. The hotel is ideally situated for a day shopping and an evening out in York. Our room was nice and clean but my only fault was the “duvet” that was on the bed. It was more like a heavy top sheet and had I been sleeping alone, I would have been cold but as my partner was there to warm my feet on I was OK!   After looking at the evening menu we decided to book a table in the restaurant for dinner. Our table was ready when we wandered down and I was surprised by how quiet the restaurant was. After ordering two pretty standard starters and main courses we settled down with a bottle of wine and waited, and waited…. Forty five minutes later our starters arrived. Mine was OK but my partner’s was sparse to say the least. We then waited a further forty minutes for our main courses. When we approached the waitress to ask about our main courses she apologized and shortly afterwards the restaurant manager, Clarke, came over. He explained that they were “a chef down” and that as it was really busy there would be a bit of a wait. Busy? Only another two or three tables were occupied. His attitude was quite arrogant and brusque and when the food finally did arrive, mine was cold and once again my poor partner’s meal was a joke! For the price we expected to pay for it, it was terrible. Dried up, cold and I think my 4 year old nephew would have asked for seconds it was such a small portion! When the bill arrived, a large amount had been taken off it but that didn’t give us back our evening or the fact that our Valentine’s Day evening meal had been poor.  Overall this is an average hotel with clean rooms and friendly staff although one or two of them could do with being sent to charm school for a week or two I feel! Breakfast the next morning was delicious and as we were starving after not eating much the night before we made sure we got our money’s worth! 
0; My daughter booked this for our Anniversary, it was in the covered courtyard area in the hotel, very echoey, loud, very busy. She asked when booking what was available, they offered a cocktail with the tea. She double checked the day before, when we got there it wasn't on the menu, they said the menu had changed!. Really from the day before, oh ok they said we can have a cocktail if we wanted. Sandwiches were dry, cakes not very good, scones were lovely. when we left we were asked how we enjoyed it, we told the truth, he wasn't impressed with our answer, wet old him to tell the chef to go to Royal Doulton as there's was lovely. wouldn't recommend . 
0; Got a last minute room here, walked from slightly the other side of the town centre, which if I had known it was a bit of hike with a bag, I might have taken a cab.  It started off well, very nice welcome with personal touches, a glass of wine, fudge as a treat in the room, and free wifi. The other thing that is good about this hotel for people travelling on their own or who don't like hotel staff coming into the room is that there is a neat little privacy cupboard where they can leave breakfast without your having to answer the door in your pyjamas.  The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was good, and pretty much everything was OK except the food.  Because it is a walk to the town centre, and the hotel to be honest is not in a great area of town for being a woman on your own after dark (not its fault) I ordered both room service dinner at around £20 and takeaway breakfast for around £8. Both were scarcely edible. Really dreadful food. I did give this feedback to the staff who checked me out but they still charged me full price for it, which is the reason I would not rush to stay here again. 
0;We booked an executive room that had been refurbished. The room was very nice spacious, lovely bathroom and a very large bed, nice furnishings. Downside it had two very small windows and the room was very dark you needed the lights on all the time. Beware of the long walk back to the rooms, this involved two lifts and a very long corridor. Our friends had a standard room which was tired! Breakfast was good and we had lunch in the brasserie which was also very good. However, the rest of the place is very tired and needs updating, peeling paint etc., We attended a buffet style private party on the Friday night, the food was ok, but not great, salmon parcels had barely cooked puff pastry which left them soggy and unappetizing. This hotel is in a beautiful setting, with a golf course and an impressive driveway, All the main doors to the hotel were left open which meant that it was very cold and uninviting. Be prepared to do a lot of walking. We awoke on the Saturday morning to no water in the room so had to forego our shower!
0;" The hotel and bar and restaurant staff - no complaints! Reception - not impressed. We booked a &quot;leisure rate&quot; - this gives you £50 credit to spend on food and drink. Checked in and they asked for. Card to authorise - I said no as already had paid and had credit. Had issues at bar so went to reception again. Anyway, was given a bill mid stay and a note to pay our balance. I finally gave in and gave my card to authorise £100 on Boxing Day. They have &quot;held&quot; £567 and apparently will not be released until 4th Jan - promised a call from mgt - still waiting! Not happy!!! "
0; My husband and I have just returned from The Vincent Hotel after a 3 night stay. The hotel is situated on the main road through Southport, Lord Street, which puts it in a very good position. It is a 10 minute walk from the railway station and there are plenty of buses running along Lord Street which would take you into Liverpool and elsewhere. The hotel is clean and our bedroom had a very comfortable King size bed. The downside was that there was no plug in the wash hand basin just a metal fixed disc which did not allow the water to fill the bowl. Do not ask for a paper to be delivered to your room as I ordered The Daily Mail (60p) and was charged £1.50. After complaining on checking out they refunded £3.00 of a £4.50 bill for papers. 
0;" Okay, having read reviews prior to visiting this hotel I was somewhat reserved as to what I may experience personally, but hey ho, I was prepared to draw my own conclusions. The hotel website painted a lovely picture of what we should expect, and indeed made the sound of our weekend stay inviting to say the least.  Having arrived mid afternoon, hunger was beginning to set in, therefore the inviting sight of other guests tucking in to a wonderful cream tea was a sight for any rumbling travellers belly........ on asking the restaurant Manager as to where we may also be able to obtain a cream tea, we were abruptly told that the lounge was full, therefore we could not have a cream tea that day...... as if that was not bad enough, we were offered no alternative food service and panicked that we would have a 5 hour wait until dinner that evening, instead settled for a drink at the bar, where we were then duly told there was nowhere to sit to enjoy our drinks and we would have to sit outside!! The fact that is was raining clearly did not matter in the eyes of the hotel staff. We were informed that the tables and seating in the bar area were all 'reserved', I must say that in over an hour that we hovered there, not one guest arrived to take these tables, however staff continued to usher arriving guests outside if they wanted to eat or drink.  In the time we spent in the bar area that afternoon, the experience was nothing short of being embroilled in a slapstick comedy to be honest. With staff rushing to and fro in a fluster, crockery being dropped and smashed, bickering between staff members infront of us, it left very little to the imagination. It appeared that no one was in control of a very busy environment and the sense of stress was very evident and wholly unprofessional.  The room: When I booked my room I was duly informed that I had been given one of the &quot;best rooms&quot; in the hotel (an Executive Double). On entering the room, indeed it did appear very grandeuse, a room with a distinctly Oriental theme, overlooking the lake. The bathroom indeed let the quality of the room/hotel down. Missing grout around the bath and sinks, significant absence of paint on the skirting boards, something which in a 4* hotel was in my opinion more like a 2*. Again a superficial approach had been adopted when it came to dusting/polishing - the main dresser in the room had such thick dust present, that my partner was able to write &quot;clean me&quot; visibly in the dust - not pleasant when the drinks offered in the room were also located on this surface. As the evening drew in, the room became dark, on attempting to switch on the lamps (no overhead lighting present), out of 5 lamps only 2 actually worked, with one being a very small bedside one, the room was somewhat dark and dismal to say the least - fine for a bit of ambience but far from practical! The ornate sofa was on the brink of collapse if two people sat on it.  On the subject of a 'double room' - we actually had 2 small beds pushed together! And the hotels way of getting around this was to use a zip-up mattress cover to conceal it!   Handles and knobs(!) - despite being very ornate in terms of furnishings, we were once again disappointed that the standard was somewhat let down when for example on opening a drawer the handle then fell off in our hands! This was typical of many of the features in this hotel, superficially stunning, but scratch the surface and you see what this hotel is really about.  Dining - In defence of what has previously been written in my review, I must say the food was excellent, with a very wide and varied choice being offered. We were somewhat surprised that despite paying for room, dinner and breakfast as part of a 'summer deal', we were expected to pay an extortionate supplement for after dinner coffee!! Fair enough wine and water charged as extra, but in my world I have NEVER been expected to pay for such a basic entity such as coffee after a formal meal!  Apart from one extremely professional waitress, the dinner service was once again slapstick, with wine being spilt by staff, wrong meals being delivered to tables, and again a very 'stressed' team present in the dining room. For my partner and I, by this time we were using the errors as a form of constant amusement throughout the stay, which we are still laughing about to this day! I must say it was like being on the set of Faulty Towers!  It was apparent that there had been a wedding held at the hotel the day/night before we arrived - apparent because the remnants (glasses etc) could be found strewn all over the external grounds, which did indeed look tatty and unprofessional, especially the next day. Another example where attention to detail and appearance lacked.  Overall I will conclude our experience:  Good: lovely grounds, beautiful views, wonderful food (dinner and breakfast), good choice of wines (with of course very high price tags), helpful and professional reception/concierge staff.  Bad: poor service from front of house staff (waiting/bar), staff lacked knowledge, room was disappointing underneath the 'frills', additional cost of coffee at evening meal, room detail was unfinished (chipped paintwork, tile grout), dust beyond belief, beds pushed together to make a Kingsize, lamps/lights in room not working. General 'cant be bothered' attitude of many staff, insufficient lounge seating additonal to what has apparently been 'reserved', noise of the motorway close by!!  In conclusion, I fail to see how this hotel could currently be classed a 4*. If those who inspect look 'underneath the surface' and beyond the 'best behaviour' attitude of staff, I do believe a very different rating would be awarded. "
0; room small and very hot. No air con. Bed comfortable. Sufficient enough for one night. The reception/bar/coffee area was very busy. On the plus side the breakfast was lovely. Have stayed before and had hoped the bed rooms had improved but sadly no. 
0; Have stayed at this hotel many times before over the years and love the location etc... Went back and decided to stay for my 50th birthday. Big mistake. The hotel made no effort to do anything special for us, in fact did nothing. We tried to check in at 1.45pm before going to see a matinee show at 2.30pm. Was told room not ready. Left bags at hotel at show started at 2.30pm. Was then out for the evening. In the morning, I assumed check out was midday, I asked if they could extend until 1pm. Was told check out was 11am and it would cost £20 per hour after that. Not impressed. They did agree to extend until 12.30 free. Not really impressed with hotel and not sure I would book again at £170 for one night excluding breakfast. Room was ok, clean but nothing special. Wish i had booked somewhere else. 
0; Room was clean and tidy. As was reception. Waited for ages to get breakfast then there was no food or plates at hot counter. Just a nightmare and understaffed. When asked if I enjoyed my stay i said yes however there was no milk in room...receptionist just stared at me. No apology or even a closing statement so I just walked off. I slept well so bed is good. TV is terrible. And free WiFi? Yeah good luck getting on that. 
0;" We came here for dinner on a Friday evening. The setting is lovely and the staff helpful. The hors d'oeuvre were most unusual with interesting combinations. Although the waiter did describe what we were about to eat, it was all a bit garbled and hard to follow. For starters I had the Lobster plate and my husband the Quail; for main course we had the Beef and the Halibut. All the dishes were exquisitely presented, and the Quail and the Beef were particularly good. However, the Halibut and its accompanying scallop were very overcooked which is disappointing for a restaurant of this calibre. The desserts were good. The recommended wines were variable, especially at the price! "
0; Stayed with my wife for a rugby league match, got a good price for BB and D deal , need to ask about chefs specials on evening meal as mine was very small and difficult to eat , breakfast was very good and restaurant staff good. 
0;We stayed here in September 2013 for 2 nights. The first room we were given was little more than a cupboard! The bedding was not particularly clean and the room was dark and tiny. The bathroom was ridiculously small. We asked to be re-roomed and were given a much better room which was bigger and cleaner, although still quite dark. All the windows appear to have wooden shutters which let in little light. Breakfast on the first morning was chaotic to say the least. There was not enough staff, tabes weren't being cleaned and not one table had a milk jug that actually had any milk in it! We eventually found someone to ask for some milk and had a good 10 minutes wait before it appeared. On the second morning, we were sent to another room which doubles as an Indian restaurant during lunchtime and evenings. This was marginally better, although the tables were very cramped and again, not enough staff. Considering the price we paid, it was not worth it and definitely not good value for money
0;" I booked this hotel as part of a weekend away with my boyfriend for his birthday. I booked it for 2 nights on a room only basis (with the option of adding in breakfast once we were there) and chose this hotel due to it's central loaction It was a standard MacDonald hotel, the reception staff were friendly and polite, offering to book us taxis for when we had plans, and giving directions to the restaurant we were eating in that night. The room we were given was on the 3rd floor (I had requested an upstairs room after reading a reviewer recommend it on TripAdvisor) and we had a nice, comfortable corner room. The room was nice enough, but felt slightly lacking in simple amenities, such as bottled water and even a biscuit to go with the tea and coffee making facilities (although the biscuit situation was rectified after the first night) we ended up buying our own bottle of water for the room while we were out, so it was no huge deal, but just a simple detail that appeared to be overlooked. On our first morning, we had decided to stay in the hotel for breakfast, and went down, well within the allocated breakfast time. The breakfast area seemed very busy, and staff looked stressed (possibly due to short staffing?) we both chose the full english, 1 with everything (including a fried egg) and one without the extras offered (Black pudding and beans) but with scrambled egg. We seemed to wait a long time for the food to arrive, and when it did finaly arrive, it was the saddest breakfast I've ever paid for! Plus they got the eggs the wrong way round, and as the scrambled eggs were now soaked in bean juice, my boyfriend managed to score my scrambled eggs as well as his fried! so once I'd given him his fried egg, I was left with 1 slice of bacon, 1 sausage and 5 small mushrooms... not really worth the £20.00 each we were charged!Of course, we could've complained but we were starving and it had taken long enough for it come out, as it was.  all in all, the hotel is nice, the location is nice, the hotel bar was nice, and I'm sure (with more staff and a less busier breakfast situation) breakfast would've been nice. But that's it, it was nice. And when paying over £100.00 per night for a room, I do expect a little bit more than just &quot;nice&quot; "
0; Large and sprawling hotel which is now in need of a facelift. We were upgraded to an executive room and even these rooms don't have A/C which on the hottest night of the year was disappointing and very rare these days. Bathrooms again in need of major facelift.  Paid £10 per person for breakfast to have order for poached eggs declined for one guest as chef had run out of eggs....sorry not acceptable at 8.30 am in a major hotel!!  Come on Holiday Inn you're seriously behind the times with this hotel in this venue. 
0; it is a nice and clean and modern hotel but i found the bed very uncomfortable and i was in an executive room. it felt like a sofa bed i could hear the springs creaking. the pillow was small and very hard. the air con in the room didnt seem to do very much so it was very stuffy. for the amount a room costs this would not be my preferred choice for the area. 
0;We went there for the Love is... package which including overnight staying in a 'spacious Executive room'. It supposed to be a romantic experience as it is my hubby's birthday...  Well, where shall I start...  When we check in - the staff was nice but did't know our package - we were mentioned about the charge of the breakfast where it supposed to be included.  Once we checked in, we didn't get our Champagne and strawberries until 11pm and we had to call and chase the reception for it....according to the website description - 'Shortly after your arrival, we will bring chocolate-covered strawberries and Champagne on ice to your room' - I think 1 and half an hour wait is not called 'shortly'.....  The room is very cold - even after we have turn the heating on to maximum.... instead of sitting on the sofa we had to hide underneath the duvet to keep us warm...  sofa sofa sofa - old and not very clean as many marks on it......  After a shocking evening stay, we had our very nice breakfast and followed by excellent massage and floating treatment which are the only good things that I can remember...
0; This is a great venue in an amazing location, but it's the little things that make it average.  Paying for parking, expensive drinks and very average service at breakfast was disappointing.  A few little changes and it could be amazing - just needs a bit of TLC, someone please make the effort. 
0;" My partner, 19yr old daughter and I stayed at this hotel over a long weekend trip to London. We arrived earlier than check-in, but the hotel kindly stored our luggage until our room was ready. We decided to have lunch in one of the hotel restaurants, &quot;The Place&quot;, as they were serving a carvery style lunch of three courses for £18 per person. This seemed like a great deal. However, one beer, one bottle of water, three buffet meals did not add up to the £78 bill.... yes... beware the service charges. When we eventually did get into our rooms, I was surprised at how small they were. Both our room and my daughters' had one double bed, a small wardrobe, a desk and en-suite, but they were very cramped. These rooms are clearly designed for business travellers who only intend to stay overnight (2 nights at most), as there is no storage for folded clothing, I.e. No drawer space. Therefore, if you are planning on staying longer than a few nights, you would either need an upgraded room or look elsewhere. The rooms also looked &quot;tired&quot;, and desperately in need of refurbishment. I booked this hotel using air miles, so can't really comment on the room cost, but the rest of the hotel was very expensive, particularly the bar &quot;Dry Martini&quot; where we managed to clock up a bill of £73 on just 4 drinks (again, beware the service charge). On the plus side, the staff were very nice, the location is excellent (2 minutes walk from Great Portland St underground), and for Spanish speakers, it is the perfect place as almost all staff are Spanish. "
0;The hotel it's self is beautiful. Our room was nice and it was great to have valet parking. The staff were all lovely but everything took so long. We waited ages to get checked in and again checking out even though we were the only couple waiting. The lady on the desk had a few receipts in her hand and told us she wont be a minute whilst she put them through the computer. We stood there like lemons for some time. The longest wait was at the bar. We were first in line with only one gentleman behind us. It seemed to take an eternity. The man waiting behind us was more disgruntled. Then I went back for a second drink. Which was quite a commotion as the waitress didn't know how to put it through he till. Then put her hand out for payment, even though I hadn't had my actual drink poured yet. I said to her, 'Sorry what am I paying for. I haven't got my drink yet!' We also heard the ladies having tea and watching the tennis say they were waiting ages for this or that and were sounding a little annoyed. The hotel was so quiet as well. Not sure how long customers are left waiting on a busy day?!
0; The children's entertainment on Saturday was disgraceful!! As a treat we took the kids to the club (it is on too late) we stay on park every three to four weeks.  Watching two adults throw marshmallows to each other and try and catch with there month, to then throw to the children on the dance floor to try and do the same!!! What are you playing at!? Kids were picking them up off the dirty floor and eating them!!!! Then to see how many Zoe could shove in her mounth and say fluffy bunnies!!! Do you think this is appropriate???? Is this entertainment??? The kids just stood there looking on FUN I THINK NOT. What a thing to be teaching children to do, I guess if they choke trying this at home you are responsible!!!!! (Saturday 24th may) Come on sort it out!!! 
0; I would rate the hotel good (between average and very good). Waiting staff in restaurant were very good whereas waiters in bar were not that good. Evening meals and breakfast was served hot and with plenty of choices and nice view from the restaurant. The family room was good in size but stains in the carpet and on walls really need cleaned albeit surface cleaning was acceptable. 
0; Lovely, clean, comfortable and functional room. Good breakfast, mediocre evening meal which was cold due to the verrrryyyy slow service. Waiters/waitresses nowhere to be seen, bar staff slow which caused long waits to get served. 
0;" Hotel room not bad but nothing special, tea/coffee tray but no biscuits. Evening meal in bar restaurant not very good, long wait for food and to ask for items several times. Hotel OK at special rate price but definitely not worth the &quot;rack&quot; rate. "
0; We visited Bristol for a friends wedding recently and wanted to stay over for the night. The Mercure was offering a reasonably good rate for a Saturday night stay (actually less than the Premier Inn in the city centre). We have stayed a couple of times before so we kind of knew what to expect.  I think the hotel has probably had pretty high occupancy and a lot of use. The rooms are a little tired because of this. We had previously noted a lack of attention to detail with cleaning which I would not expect of a 4* hotel.  Zowie the Guest Services Manager was very attentive even before our arrival, we had thought we might like to check in early before the wedding and Zowie had made arrangements that we could either check in early or at least check in and leave the bags. As it was we were running late and so we decided to just check in when we went to the hotel, this was around midnight, as the hotel does have 24 hour reception and we had pre-paid the room.  The check in was fine, we were given a room on the ground floor, 104 I think. We just dived into the room and got ready to sleep. I did notice that there was a tear in the sheets, which is not what I would expect. However, the bed was enormous which was great! The room was big but in a kind of vacant way. They styling is very nice and there are big windows. However, this particular room did not have a desk or dressing table which was a little odd.  Generally the hotel is of a good standard but attention to detail is a little lacking. There was no TV remote in the room for example.   The shower was an odd one - very powerful, actually to the point of being painful! I had to turn the water pressure right down in order to use it. We didn't stay for breakfast as we chose to eat in a local breakfast place. We were right by the door to all of those bedrooms and as I had thought it was really noisy with a lot of noise audible from the corridoor, so no Sunday lie in!  I mentioned the points that we felt were dissappointing in the customer questionnaire we were asked to complete online after our stay. I was very pleased to receive a lovely reply from Zowie addressing all the points I had made and Zowie I think is doing an excellent job, all that remains is to get the housekeeping up to standard and the attention to detail on track and this could be a great hotel.  We'll give it another chance. But for now, set your expectations accordingly. On a final note, I find it amusing that they market the hotel for spa breaks! It is in former bank 1960's building and it wouldn't be my first choice for a spa break! 
0;Hotel is beautiful and the leisure facilities were fantastic, but the service in the restaurant was awful. It wasn't overly busy but we still had to wait over half an hour for our starters. We had to ask for a wine list and then after 20 minutes had to ask for someone to take our order. Our main course of pork was not the best quite tough and overall food was average for that sort of hotel. Breakfast was no better we had dead daffodils on our table in dirty water ! It was a buffet breakfast which again was average but between each course our plates weren't cleared away and we weren't offered another cup of coffee. Very poor for the prices. Our room was ok but very cold and the bed was very uncomfortable. My daughter slept on a sofa bed and said that was really uncomfortable. We wouldn't hurry back you get better service at a premier inn ! Oh and you had to pay for wifi !!!
0;The service at Hilton its nice, very helpful and kind at the reception, and wonderful at the hotel's restaurant as well.  But I have few comments about the room we had. We had booked a room at high floor, with front view of the river, however it was meant to be smoking room and at arrival it appeared as it wasn't what left us with no choice to swap it. Instead we got a second floor room with the most unwanted view you may wish for - into police headquarters across the street, which was described as our best choice. Unfortunately we could not complaint about that issue as we booked our room directly at Hilton's website.  Im sure many customers suffered parking issue at the Hilton as well. Well at the hotel they informed us that customers must park at the underground parking nearby, which is just normal pay and display. There is no refund for the tickets and that car park its just one of the city centre paid cpark for anybody. The only thing is that Hilton customers park at designated side, with Hilton hotel directions. But be prepared for dragging your luggage all the way through car park to the hotel yourself. We spoke to security because there is a small secured hotel car park just right outside the hotel entrance and they said that this car park its only for blue badge holders, however you will see no blue badges but some super-cars of some super-reach clients instead. We didn't give up and they ended us letting us park outside as well.   Coming back to the room. As I mentioned the view we head was nothing of what we expected at that location. The rooms were really smelling of cigarettes and smoke, even before we got in, the whole floor seemed to smell like a pub and it must be ventilation issue. Instead they plugged airwick refreshener, which in some sense did help a little. Don't get me wrong there is always choice of the non smoking and smoking rooms and I have never seen smoking room actually physically smelling of a smoke.There was issue with bathroom the water stream was very slow, but water wasn't flowing down as bath seemed to be undrained and it was hard to take a shower. Inside the wardrobe rail to hang clothes was completely damaged and broken, im surprised that it was unnoticed while was cleaned. And the phone inside the room wasn't working so we couldn't report the problem strait away. The funny thing, the toilet was mounted into wall so high that while sitting on it my feet would be in the air lol. Overall décor its quite basic and room was very dark, but I would expect more from Hilton. At night there was a party going on downstairs at the hotel, the music was so loud that we could hear it on the second floor, what was disturbing during our sleep. Beds however were quite comfortable.  Location its brilliant, right across the street, there is a riverside with variety of restaurants and few local attractions. Behind hotel its city centre also fool of restaurants, shops and things to do.   In honesty we are not a fussy people at all, but if we were to come back to Liverpool we would pay a bit more and stay in better hotel. For this price we paid we were not satisfied with the choice.  At the end due to all inconvenience of quality of our room we were given nice breakfast, and even though the kitchen was about to close the staff cooked something for us and served us in really nice manner, however future discount or voucher would be better resolution for such a big name hotel and such a number of inconvenience.
0; Booked a one night spa break Inc evening meal and spa next day. Starting with spa as we arrived before room was ready. Spa was small but really nice and not too busy at all so always room in hottub :) 30 min mud chamber treatment included which was lovely. Also paid for couples massage which was nice but probably wouldn't spend that much on a massage again. Went to check in reception staff lovely and friendly. Disappointment for me was the room. I'd paid extra to upgrade to a suite as a treat and it just wasn't what I was expecting... just found it to be dark, gloomy and dated although it was huge. Also view of carpark. Bathroom was really nice and modern. When I booked I asked for nicest of the suites (which I was willing to pay for) and was told the Eliot suite had been refurbished which I just don't think it has. Anyway had a few drinks in bar which was lovely and barman super friendly. Drinks a bit expensive but only what I expected. Evening meal was lovely as was breakfast the next day which had everything possible. Overall I probably would stay again but just stay in a standard room. 
0;" When booking a double room, I didn't expect a twin and having to &quot;push the beds together&quot; as was suggested. Beds are also on the hard side and our first night was disturbed by a screamer at 5am who we thought was being murdered judging by the racket that woke the entire floor. Of course the hotel cannot be held responsible for more vocal guests, however a simple apology the following morning wouldn't have gone amiss. Room service left us 1 hand towel between 2 of us. The free wifi is poor and the drinks at the bar are expensive. The hotel is in a good location for the train station but a fair distance from the town centre. Watch out for the lift door that grabs you if you don't get in quick enough! It is a contemporary hotel and the decor is modern if a little gothic. The staff were young and friendly. "
0; Stayed for a Saturday night. Stayed at this hotel about 5 years ago and nothing has changed. I would say it is now in need of a refurb, certainly in the bedrooms. Any shabbiness is hidden by the decor style in the communal areas but it is obvious in the bedrooms. The bathroom in particular needs a regrout and mould removal. Our room was also quite small. It did not suggest 'luxury'. The building itself is impressive and location is great. Breakfast is fine though you have to pay extra for a cooked breakfast. It also struck me as self-serving for a sizeable hotel to start breakfast at 8 - unfortunately life cannot always be run on a lie-in, take it easy basis. 
0; Stayed for an overnight before a flight. Booked two rooms. One stank of smoke the other was better but both tired and depressing. Ok for eight hours before a flight. The one good thing was the reception staff who could not have been more helpful. 
0; Very warm welcome and efficient service checking in even though they were busy. The rooms leave a lot to be desired. Needs an update or refresh and although whilst it is functional there was a dirty towel in my room and it doesn't feel particularly clean. Let's hope the breakfast makes up for it !! 
0; This is a beautiful hotel which we have stayed in three times this year, sad to say I will not be returning as I have awaited a response from the management team in respect of my comments left firstly hand written on the back of my bill in and verbally when we checked out and again by the electronic link we received a few days later. My comments were constructive in view that if you are well traveled and a spa user if you quote 5 star service it needs to be consistent every time. If you ignore your customer feedback they vote with there feet .  We first stayed in March for two nights for my husbands 50th in a dockside room which was huge and beautifully clean. Small attention to detail was missed on this stay such as missing cups in room, no cups/cutlery with tray service, no milk for cereal etc. with tray breakfast, delivered only warm. Coffee machine not working.  We gladly paid the then £10 additional premium to use the spa which is aesthetically lovely, however the water fountains were not working, what looked like a thermostat cover missing had wires exposed on the wall in bio sauna. But we loved the ambiance and voted with feedback these things are easily addressed and to return.  The second stay in May was a treat for my sons girlfriends 18th, again two night stay and similar issues. Spa still had same repairs outstanding.Toiletries part used in room. Meal allowance as we had bought a package not explained so you could opt for a la carte etc .without prompt and so on.  Undeterred we returned in August to escape for one night for a birthday treat for me, check in took twice as long as normal as requested debit card presented for payment of a bottle prosecco ordered to room and £50 tab, pin taken all seemed well. We had pre paid and upgraded to a superior corner dockside room as the light and view of the Mersey is much better. Having been delayed by traffic we quickly changed and went to the spa as pre booked. The cost had increased to £15 , yet the jet bed in hydro-pool turned on permanently (no respite from noise if you wanted quiet interval ) water feature not working, water fountains not working and jacuzzi jets on ledge not working. Wires still exposed in sauna. On leaving spa I was advised payment could not be charged to room/taken as no card present to charge to room as I had paid for my booking in cash, I explained I had presented my card at reception and got a blank look and no offer to rin g reception. I asked what do you want me to do as stood obviously with just a toilet bag and no purse, the answer was I needed to pay (need I comment). I explained I would go to reception and resolve myself.  After changing I went to reception before dinner to be informed that I should have presented a credit card, they no longer took a £50 a day tab on a debit card by the same receptionist whe n I asked why she hadn't advised she shrugged. Becoming weary of routine and five minutes from dinner reservation I said I would pay as I went, which meant pre drink in bar,end of meal etc. - the only productive service was the bar where we were deemed worthy to open a tab.  Restaurant food was very good, starters generous and delicious. We ordered the Chateaubriand which exceptional on our first visit was disappointing as the sides were uninspiring and arrived cold as the steak was called away too early whilst we ate the starter, when sides were replaced we had almost finished the main.  Service started well but as the restaurant got busier we waited 25 mins after main,as did two other tables and in the end because of the wait and lack of concern re cold side dishes we decided not to bother with coffee/dessert and retired to the bar instead. Had two first class cocktails.  When we returned to room around 11pm and went to bed I could smell a nasty aroma around bedside table, on investigating the floor was damp and it was clear someone on previous night had been sick. Unfortunate as unless you felt the floor/lay down the smell could have been missed. Too tired to plan on swapping room/ringing room service to start a clean up (it was my birthday !) I placed a perfumed towel over area which sufficed and fortunate that the beds are so big moved over (!) On way out I reported to the maid in the corridor in the morning.  We had ordered breakfast in the room and when my husband opened the door thinking it was room service our bill had been placed for with a prompt to pay before leaving (why wouldn't we?) When breakfast arrived we were promptly asked to pay the £5 tray charge there and then ! The tray had no sugar, no side plates for toast or butter knives.   Now some of you may read this and think how pedantic, but when your spend per night is around £350 every visit, you previously recommended the place to friends and then find because you have paid cash that someone stands waiting for a £5 tray charge as if you are about to abscond it doesn't exactly reflect the 5 star customer experience .  Equally having to sum up the inadequacies of what could be so much better on social media in hope that someone actually cares is even sadder. 
0; Visited with my daughters to celebrate my mums life, every year they take me somewhere special and I was thrilled when they told me that we were going to the Rowhill as I have never had a bad experience there. But on this occasion I felt let down, the drinks came up wrong and a martini took 20 minutes to arrive. The starter were lovely and really flavoursome , scallops cooked to perfection, however our mains were not very nice at all and one of my Daughters had the fish and chips which actually tasted like it had been sat in a chip pan for hours, full of grease and nasty, the lamb came up but to be honest you couldn't find any it was all bone. The bill was £175 and if it had been up to its usual standard( see my old reviews of this place) I wouldn't mind but For my girls to pay that money for less than perfect ( not what I expect at The Rowhill) is not very good 
0; A lovely weekend, hotel was ok for the price (even though used tesco club card points). Food a bit pricey but good. The only issue we had was there was a wedding on both the Friday and Saturday and it would have been nice to have been told when checking in. Also the Saturday night wedding party were very noisy in their bedrooms (we think it was them) as at midnight some very loud banging which shook the windows, noticed some signs were off the wall the next morning. Staff didn't seem to know anything. So it would be good if wedding party guests could be put together away from other guests, I know this isn't always practical but with alcohol and fun can lead to being noisy and they don't think of other people in that state which doesn't help other guests. Also maybe hotel trying to advise guests to think of others!! 
0;" This place was fine. We needed somewhere late on one night and paid £90 odd for the room. I've stayed in much nicer places; the décor was dated and the shower was tricky to turn off. It was great to have a bath though. My husband's full English was good but the kippers were rank (I fed them to my dog) - dry and chewy. I wouldn't rush back but it wasn't awful either. "
0; I stayed over one night here and other than ringing the bell for 20 minutes before I was let in, not being helped to my room with my suitcase and bags (there's no lift), and the WiFi not working in my room on the top floor.... It was alright.  The place is shabby around the edges but is fine for one night. The bedding and pillows wasn't very comfortable and the shower door fell off while I was using it... But it definitely wasn't the worst I've stayed in. It's right near loads of take aways, 5-10 minute walk to town.   The receptionist on in the morning was much more polite and helpful than the night staff. 
0; The Swan in Bedford is located in a wonderful place, right on the river, which at night is lit up and is a great place to walk. The Swan itself has beautiful interior and grand architecture, however, both the customer service and spa are disappointing. I regularly go to the Swan as it really is a nice place to be, however have rarely encountered a staff member with good customer service skills, or even a smile! Visiting the spa yesterday, I had a manicure which sadly was only average with a luxury price tag. The Swan does have an outdoor terrace with bar which is a top place to sit in the summer (haven't been in winter) right next to the river, redeeming it in some way! Bedrooms are again lovely and luxurious so a nice place to go if you don't mind the absent customer service. 
0;Was expecting something fantastic from this hotel but was disappointed.  First of all the hotel and room was freezing,everyone had a coat on eating dinner . The food at dinner was ok my husband had a starter and it looked like cat food ,the rest was ok but only very small amount of it . Breakfast was very good ,you had so much choice . Room was deluxe but there was nothing deluxe about it...toilet had a big crack through it ,bath had black mould round it ,paint was all missing round doors.The room needs doing up very dated .We looked at a 2 bedroom suite while there and the prices range from about £500 for 2 nights but even that room needed updating and painting...not good for a 4 star hotel .
0;I stayed here when attending a wedding recently. The check in etc was very good and staff generally very friendly. The room was clean, large bed and no complaints.  Drinks at the bar in the hotel were very expensive - and for Peterborough in particular.  What holds the hotel back is the quality of the breakfast. It felt like a dining room - masses of people in and out and the breakfast quality was very poor indeed.
0; I have stayed here twice - about 7 months apart. We went back the second time because the first experience had been so positive - we'd had a huge room with a huge, new bathroom and a seating area - there are pictures of this room on the traveller photos. However, our second visit was different. We were allocated room 40 (which is an interlinked room) and this was up in the attic. My sister bashed her head twice when getting out of bed. The most distressing thing however, was the flies. We encountered four of them in the room in one evening - one was already lying on the floor dead and the other three we killed ourselves. The bathroom had seen better days and there were hairs on the floor and in the sink unit (not ours). Perhaps this wouldn't have seemed so bad if we were unaware of how much better the rooms in this hotel can be...We didn't eat in this time either - the food in the bar area last time was fine, but nothing special. We had a nice Italian in Keswick instead. The windows in the room did not open very far at all and there is not a plug socket near the mirror, which made blow drying and straightening hair very difficult. There is plenty of parking and the surrounding area is lovely - I believe some rooms even have views of this, rather than just views of other parts of the hotel roof. The hotel have offered a 10% discount off our next stay. I doubt we will be taking advantage of this. 
0; Conveniently located in the heart of the town the first problem was parking. If you are lucky enough to find a parking space outside the hotel in order to drop off your bags then the friendly reception staff will direct you to the reasonably priced pay and display car park near the station.  We were in room number 4 on the first floor. This rates as the smallest double bedroom I have ever stayed in with the smallest bathroom ever! Clean and nicely decorated but so small. Comfortable bed. Hotel staff responded immediately to any request.  It appeared that the majority of the customers in the bar were not resident at the hotel. It was more of a local pub, this suprised us as the bar prices were outrageously expensive.  We ate out on the Saturday night so cannot comment on the bar/ restaurant food. Breakfast was good but very busy. Don't think I would go back 
0;" Close to Gatwick airport this hotel seemed an ideal choice to break our journey before flying out of the country. Staff helpful especially in the restaurant and bar. Family room really nice and room service excellent. Restaurant menu same as room service and therefore a bit limited. But all cooked to a good standard. What unfortunately really spoiled our stay was the stifling heat in the room and an ineffective air con system, despite being on full power and noisy. Meant we didn't get much sleep before our flight and this meant we probably didn&quot;t benefit from the overnight stay at all. Can't open windows due to proximity to airport, really disappointed could have been so much better (room 409) "
0; The hotel was better than we thought looking at previous reviews but could do with a bit of a refurb. But for the price we paid on travelstyle trip can't really complain. The food and staff nice, warm rooms only fault was a dirty shower curtain. Would probably staying again if in the area. 
0; Great location for City Centre, staff very helpful and great choice of food at the breakfast buffet. I was located in room 627, room cosy and compact, handy to have a fridge in the room. Bathroom is tiny and it is awkward to get to the toilet but hot water in plentiful supply. First time I have stayed in a hotel and complimentary ear plugs have been left for your use. Discovered at 02:30 onwards on Saturday and Sunday morning when hen and stag parties started to return from their celebrations. No fun when you have to get up to do a full day's work! 
0; Having got a great deal at the Mercure, I was happy with the price paid!!  Arriving, we followed the signs to the car park around the back of the hotel, we thought it was extremley small. I was on two crutches, this car park was not disable friendly, There was at least 10 steep steps up to the door..... with my friends helping me with my luggage i made it!! Then followed a long corrider via conference roms and bedrooms, we came to more stairs downwards!!! i was starting to wonder why i bothered to go away for the weekend!!!at the top of the stairs there was sofa i was glad of the rest!! my friend went to check in and we were given a room on the 2nd floor, that meant making my way down more stairs to get the lift up to the 2nd floor!!!  The room was large, 2 double beds for 3 of us!!! There was a horrible smell like a nursing home in our room!! my friend when to use the bathroom and the door was broken!! she couldnt close it!! Room looked clean untill closer inspection.....as a hotel receptionist I like to check the place over, 2 light bulbs out?? dirt behind the broken door in bathroom, broken tiles in bathroom, dirty mugs in the tea/coffee facltys!!!   When coming back to our rooms with no AC on, the room was freezing, all of us under covers to warm up!! must have took 2hrs to warm up using the hot facilty on the AC.  We were woke up at 9am, with noise of people in corriders knocking on doors!!! not the nicest when we idnt get in till 3am :(   No addtional glasses apart from the scummy ones in the bathroom to get ourselves a drink!!  This hotel does not meet 4star standards, I have previously stayed in the Ramada across the road is to a much better standard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  £12 for car parking or 24hrs redicilous espec when ot disable friendly!!! free in Ramada!!! 
0;This was a strange experience. There was a noisy wedding party going on but also coach loads of elderly visitors. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms very adequate but lacking in character. That just about sums up the whole place! A beautiful building and setting but just soulless. What a shame! The restaurant was like sitting in a motorway service station, but the food was actually quite good. The restaurant staff were charming.
0; Manor house was beautiful, sitting for tea in lounge was fabulous. Food in manor house was excellent but tiny portions for the price. We stayed in a suite and it was tired and bathrooms awful, bed wasn't comfortable. Worst part was we went for lunch at bar 19th before we were due to leave and ordered our food. 40 minutes later we asked where it was and the waitress had forgot to place the order. We left hungry and not impressed. Having spent £460 for a night at Foxhill we left feeling very disappointed. What could have been a wonderful stay was ruined at the end. 
0; We booked this hotel for its location as we were visiting the Christmas markets. We arrived at around 1ish and were due to meet friends at 1:30 so we checked in and threw our bags into the room before heading out. First appearances, the room was fairly small but clean and comfortable.   We returned to the room at around 10:30 and when we closed the curtains noticed that the outer window had a huge crack in it and the sill has a whole in it so all of the windows were completely covered in compensation and you couldn't see out of the Windows.   We went to reception to advise them of this issue. We were told, very politely, that the hotel was full and they couldn't move us. We went back to the room and went to bed.   In the morning as we still couldn't see out of the Windows we decided that we would complain when we checked out, which we did to a gentleman we were told was a manager. He was very polite when I showed him the pictures I had taken and said he would pass it to their customer service manager and ask her to call me the following day.   That was 4 days ago and we are still waiting to be contacted from the hotel.   I realise this is a large hotel and quite impersonal and probably aimed more at business but I would expect to have received some form on contact given we made an official complaint.   So, all that said, it's an ok hotel and the rooms are clean and comfortable just a shame that their customer service is lacking. 
0; I stayed here for two nights in feb 2014 as a treat for my daughter we paid £298 as we upgraded to the executive room,my first issue at the hotel is the spa after trying to get through to book a apt it was 10days before I heard back and this was only due to the threat of asking to speak with a manager,we finally booked our treatment the night before our stay although I wasn't overwhelmed with the treatment I had a massage my daughter had a manicure but was left waiting outside alone whilst I was in the treatment room (she's 11yrs old) I was under the impression there was a beauty therapist with her as she was there when I went in the room when I come out she had been left sat there alone for half an hour,my daughter used the swimming pool but could not use the jacuzzi as there were tiles missing due to this reason it was closed,the changing facilities were just ok nothing special and fairly untidy not what I expected, .now to the room .....bear in mind we paid nearly £300 it wasn't worth it although it was a nice room it was a little dated and certain things were shabby and tired looking,the shower wasn't great as soon as u turned it on it went to the side which then caused water to leak all over the floor,the toiletries were bear minimum nowhere near enough for two people for two nights and the fabulous views were ruined by the filthy ness of the window when the sun shone you could barely see out,I would stay again but only if I got this through an offer and I definitely would not pay full price,I have no bad words about the reception staff they really were helpful as was the lady who was at the desk in the gym,however the bar staff in the podium bar and restaurant were particularly bad as was the lady working in the executive lounge during breakfast I didn't find her particularly friendly and tables were left with dirty plates the whole time we were there.All in all the hilton Is a nice hotel but not top of the range like its made out to be and some of the staff really do let it down,I expect a lot of people would visit this as a one off As its just not worth the money. 
0; I have stated in numerous Q hotels and I was disappointed with this choice and the overall experience with this hotel. I don't think I will be back here. Bar area isn't big, restaurant looks like it is a canteen. Food quality was poor and service at breakfast wasn't great.  At the spa steam room wasn't working however treatment was good. As I said previously I wouldn't book this hotel again. 
0;" We booked the indulgence room 1 Anella (told it was the best room in the house) for my husband's birthday treat, to find on entering that the table set in front of the seating area in the room had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. A negative second impression. On approach to our room which is set apart with one other room on the opposite landing, very visibly at eye level as we climbed the open step stairs, there was a tray set on the floor directly outside the door. A negative first impression! Used by the previous occupants it remained there for several hours, despite that housekeeping came to wipe down the table in our room and ignored it, as had the person showing us to our room and the luggage valet! Whilst the hotel has a stylish feel, it is looking a bit tired (worn patches on stairways and wooden floors and slightly grubby textiles in places) our balcony (with an uninterrupted sea view), needed power washing as the white paint was green in patches and the plastic furniture grubby, but the overall ambience is one of calm. That is until you become aware of the pounding feet. More of that later.  My biggest disappointment and criticism is with the quality of the bed or lack thereof. It was a very basic divan (though superking) with a feather mattress topper laid over it, which did little to engender real comfort. I would expect a quality mattress such as a vi-spring (local to Devon so extremely ECO with much natural materials ie wool, hemp) and very surprised to find the gorgeous pillows were imported from Germany! How eco is that Scarlet? Though I admit, having noted the details from the label, I am tempted to order some for myself ! They are plush, plump, feather with eco cotton covers. Well done Scarlet for getting this so right! Please address the bed issue before we would consider a return visit.  The grouting in the shower room is dirty, discoloured with soap scum, negligent and unnecessary (we also run a B&B bedandbreakfastdevon.org and recommend a steam cleaner for both eco properties and efficiency), and the very powerful extractor fan stayed on all night. Whilst this might be very effective for the reduction of condensation and maintaining the fabric of the building, it was so disruptive as to awaken my husband who could not get back to sleep. With no tea or coffee making facilities in the bedroom he was reluctant to disrupt my sleep further (as I had been restless and uncomfortable and awakened several) times and so waited several hours until I awoke and felt sorry for his plight and rang down early for the pre ordered tray. We do not provide trays in our B&B bedrooms because of risk to children scalding, but Scarlet prides itself on being an &quot;adult only &quot; hotel (encouraging you to walk around barefoot in the same breath). However, he was able to work on his laptop via fast connected broadband which is included in the price. Another plus for the Scarlet. The robes provided in the bedrooms (thin and too short even for me at 5'5&quot;) are expected to be used when you go down to the spa and my husband was sent back to fetch the ugly brown flip flops, (supplied in a bag in the wardrobe of which we were not made aware), when we went down to attend for our complimentary hot tub. We presented ourselves well before the appointed time of 6 pm, but were collected several minutes late and our half hour soak turned out to be approximately 18 minutes!! Our tub was placed slightly off centre to the one behind and though there are beach breaker upstands planted in the ground, afforded no privacy whatsoever from the couple behind. The fact that we were not given a fresh robe from the spa area meant that we had to wear soaking wet robes to return to our room. We were encouraged to not shower to &quot;absorb the benefits of the seaweed&quot; added to the tub, but there was such a strong chlorine presence that we daren't! Also my husband went for a swim and within minutes his eyes were stinging and bloodshot from the amount of chlorine in the (very small) pool. Surely, this is not the most eco friendly method of providing a swimming facility!! We have a pool which uses Oxygen tablets. There is no spinning machine to dry your swim suit which meant carrying a dripping costume upstairs and once inside the changing room, you need to go back to reception for a towel which was not offered before going into the hot tub.  We had dinner and it was actually faultless with good size portions and unusual quirky dessert. I had the cheese board which consisted of three cheeses and again generous portions of each. The wine list is extensive and expensive. We were charged £10 for a single glass of unimpressive bubbly in the tub.  We had booked 90 minute treatments at £95 each for next morning and when 40 minutes of these were used up in &quot;consultation&quot; ie filling out forms and discussing our body types &quot;dosha&quot; (and yes I am fully aware it's Ayurvedic, but this IS excessive when one pays for a hands on treatment), we were both dismayed. I was not disappointed in the treatment (Ayurvedic massage) when it came (with Sarah), however as she has a lovely temperament and calming gentle approach and agreed to a full body massage (which I desperately needed after the uncomfortable bed). I would choose to have a treatment with her again, though not at this price (unless it was a one and a half hour ACTUAL massage, as it is extremely misleading. The spa treatment area is unique in my experience (bedouin tent style) and its deliberately darkened ambience, a contrast to the bright, light filled open areas of the living, dining and sleeping quarters is a resounding success in inducing a still mind. Again Scarlet well done. However, you need to address the pounding footsteps overhead the lovely post-treatment area.  This is a room where those lovely canvas pods (very creaky to get into until settled and I want one please), hang and the idea is to float in an induced relaxing atmosphere further prolonging the benefits of your treatment. This is a commendable idea in principle, but as I was waiting for my husband to have his treatment which followed mine (this I feel really ought to have been fitted in tandem, but I booked only two days beforehand), I had plenty of time to be aware of the resounding noise of feet travelling back and forth on the floor above. This utterly defeats the objective and needs to be addressed Scarlet.  The staff are well presented, and respectful, the spa and restaurant staff especially so, but there should be awareness of every role ie SOMEONE should have taken that tray down from in front of our door BEFORE we arrived and several people afterward had the opportunity to remove it and did not. I can understand why they try to encourage people to walk around barefoot to minimise the reverberation a flaw in the building's design and structure, but in my opinion this is not hygienic. Finally, my husband left a pair of very nice (new) pyjama bottoms in the bedroom and they have failed to find them so far, though they say they may have gone to the laundry. It is quite possible they have been bundled up in the bedlinen but they are black cotton and pretty highly visible, one would think. I hope to hear that they have found them in the next few days. It would be unfair to say you are &quot;all show and no trousers&quot; but there are aspects that need addressing (vitally: the bed, cleanliness, eco friendly pool and tub, noise (overhead the relaxation area particularly but other places as well as in the restaurant) if you are to maintain the standard that you have set for yourself Scarlet. Overall, I feel you must not just depend on your fantastic location and stylishness of the building but strive to deliver the perfect experience. Nearly there, but not quite Scarlet. "
0; Very close to the station but very little to redeem it beyond that. Very dated (not in an endearing way!) although I think some rooms have been refurbished.   I requested a quiet room which was away from the road but that didn't really matter seeing at the plumbing and air systems are so ancient you could hear them through ear plugs anyway.  This hotel only relies on location. 
0; I stayed one night in a small single room which was very comfortable with modern furnishings and decor. The double bed was against the wall and behind the headboard was the shower cubical. The bathroom was not separate and was practically in the bedroom which is fine if you are in the room alone. Very good air con in the room, and it was nice to have an opening window to let fresh air in. I left early so didn't have the breakfast so I can not comment on that. I did order room service dinner which was nice and a very large portion. The negatives I have are that I had to wait 40 minutes for the shuttle to collect me from the airport. And there was a convention taking place in the hotel during my stay and lots of people were around the entrance and reception area signing in for their convention when I arrived at the hotel to check in, it was mayhem and made me feel quite uncomfortable, so my first impressions of the hotel were not good, good job the room was nice. 
0;" My other half and I stayed here for one night as I bought a deal which combined this hotel with a trip to The Shard.  I know London well having grown up and worked here and I have to admit Bloomsbury is not my first choice of areas to stay in, however, I wanted to visit the British Museum so this seemed well situated.  The Hotel is very well positioned for Euston Station and we managed to park free on a road nearby as it was a Sunday/Bank Holiday stay which was a bonus, also you don't need to enter the congestion charge zone as the Hotel is just on the edge.  Our room was tiny! I mean tiny! I've stayed in lots of hotel rooms around the world and this has to have been the smallest! Fine for one night, but the shortage of drawers and storage space would be a problem if you were staying more than a night. The bathroom was a good size though even though the sink was small and, as many others have said if would be helpful if there was another shelf or more places to put things or even a few more hooks. Especially annoying as, because it is a wet room/bathroom you can't afford to leave anything on the floor as it will get soaked!!  The other really annoying thing about the room was the position of the two wall/reading lights above the bed! Why on earth are they put at such a low height??! Just 6&quot; higher would at least have meant you could sit up in bed easily!  The bed was comfy and the big tv and Nespresso machine, as well as a kettle, were nice additions. Staff were friendly and helpful and our breakfast was tasty and adequate.  It was a 15 minute walk away from the British Museum and Euston Station was 5 minutes in the opposite direction, there was a bus stop outside so getting around was easy. We had our evening meal in Covent Garden and it was a pleasant 25 minute or so stroll back to the Hotel.  I probably wouldn't stay here again, as there are other hotels that I prefer, however, for the price and what we wanted it was fine for the night and, if you are using Euston Mainline station and only need a one night stay it is recommended. "
0; Whereas impressive from the outside and after being rather ostentatiously greeted by a porter on the way in I figured that I was in for a treat   As I walked to the reception desk I noted 1 receptionist chatting in Spanish with some guests whilst another receptionist was talking to a fellow employee, I waited patiently whilst eavesdropping on the conversation receptionist number one was having with the Spanish guests (I speak Spanish too) she was very helpful and friendly, throughout listening to that conversation I found out how the wifi in the room worked, what time and where to find breakfast etc.   Once the second receptionist finished talking to his colleague, eye contact was studiously avoided for several very tense moments whilst I 'uhmmed' and 'aahd' about whether to clear my throat or just say something, I was saved by having to do that by the phone ringing... Phew! Now he had a real reason to continue ignoring me..   Shortly after, having run out of phone calls, colleagues and interesting things on computer screens he finally acknowledged my presence and checked me in, I had to ask the questions and the location of the lift (meanwhile receptionist number one was still regaling the Spanish family with helpful advice) as his check in manner was perfunctory at best...   After getting into the baffling lift ( you can't just call the lift there's a touch screen you have to register into.. ) I reached my room, opulently furnished but lacking the basic cleanliness and comfort which is what matters more to me..  I.e: no hand soap, air con wasn't working very well, bed sheets not properly tucked in, mattress very hard, bath tub had soap scum stains and several short and curly hairs 'shudder' I had to wash it out before I could use it..   Perhaps the worst element were the paper thin walls, twice I found myself dashing around looking between my personal phone and my work phone as I could hear one vibrate, after several confusing seconds realising neither had incoming calls I heard, in the next room, somebody answer his phone.. It was his phone I could hear vibrate! I also found myself forced into watching friends as the room next door was also watching that channel so to avoid conflicting noise I tuned into the same channel on the tv.   All in all I've had better service and a more comfortable nights sleep at a premier inn for half the money and a fraction of the snootiness.. It was ok but not my favourite stay in a hotel by far.. 
0; On a plus note this hotel is in a convenient central location on the doorstep of Chinatown. The car park adjacent to the hotel is discounted for Novotel guests which is great. Our party of 2 adults and a child arrived early before check in and the receptionist kindly let us have a vacant room which again was a bonus, the lady was very pleasant but gave little information about facilities at the hotel other than breakfast times although there is a spa, gym, bar/restaurant etc. The reception is clean spacious and modern and several large lifts are available , we were on the 4th floor. The room is where I felt this hotel doesn't quite cut the 4 star rating. It was a little tired and worn. Only 2 sockets and neither located anywhere convenient for a mirror etc. The stained ironing board cluttered the open wardrobe area and obscured the full length mirror, it all made it a little awkward to get ready. The oversized TV did little to distract from the niggles and the old worn hairdryer in a drawer was difficult to stretch to a mirror plus nowhere to sit to apply makeup, dry hair etc. We had to ask for the childs bed to be made up and once down the sofa bed took up all floor space leaving nowhere for easy access to cases etc.  We had to request additional pillows as none are provided. The extras you would expect in hotel of this star rating as opposed to a budget hotel were measly. For example 1 small shampoo, body wash and soap for 3 guests? Barely worth providing. The minibar was overpriced and an empty fridge would have been more helpful. The windows did not feel soundproofed and again I have stayed in lower priced hotels in Manchester which manage that and subsequently I didn't get the best nights sleep due to outside noise. The room again lacked information on either the hotel or area. The breakfast staff the following morning were very welcoming and helpful and once we were seated we were brought a pot of coffee instantly. The choice of food options was great and plenty of fruit juices, however disappointingly the cooked breakfast was cold not warm but actually stone cold. We paid a reduced rate for room and breakfast through an accor member deal and I felt that was a fair price for the stay and I must admit I would not have been happy to pay more. Overall for a night it was adequate with friendly staff in a good location just lacked the detail and comfort to make it anything above average.  
0;" On initially booking the hotel I was a little taken aback that instead of just the normal contact number, they wanted my full credit card details as well. On arrival I was asked to pay in full before we had even seen the room and when my wife was unable to locate the hair drier the lady on receptions answer was &quot;we'll it's in there&quot;. As the hotel is a way out of town we decided to eat in the restaurant We went in a little early with a view to having a few drinks and a leisurely read of the menu but we were immediately told we would not be given a menu at all until much nearer our booking time.  At the end of the meal I complained that the biscuits on the cheeseboard were horrible and inedible. The waitress passed on my comments but I was still charged in full for my dessert.  Finally, having spent over £220 for one nights stop over, my wife was charged a further £3 when she inadvertently left an item of clothing behind and asked for it to be posted on.  The hotel itself is lovely and spotlessly clean but they really need to step up their customer service to warrant their high prices. "
0;Found this by chance on-line -offer of the day. This hotel is OK for the price we paid. The rooms are clean and adequate, although it was described as having a fridge but we couldn't find it! The location is great for certain areas of London, you can walk to Kensington Palace from the hotel -it's literally only a 15/20 minute gentle walk through the gardens off the Bayswater Road.the price didn't include breakfast so we pre-ordered this. The breakfast staff need to be more aware of customers needs, after a little mix up with staff not having us down for a pre-booked breakfast we were pretty much left to fend for ourselves not knowing what the system was for breakfast. Also they had run out of eggs, and it took an age for them to top these up, staff seem to avoid eye contact with you and so consequently miss important cues from customers that could easily be recified. The breakfast was adequate though a little over-priced. the hotel round the corner does a full english for £7.50.  Also we asked the hotel to order us a taxi, we were not told until the taxi turned up that it's there own car/driver and subsequently at a much higher price, it left us in an awkward position and out of politeness we used the service. This should be made clear to you at the time of requesting. We estimated that we paid an extra £5 for that service which is fine if you are made aware of this.Otherwise you can flag a taxi down outside the hotel. All in all this was an OK hotel in which I would stay in again, great location, clean and adequate rooms, friendly man in the reception area.
0; Funky, clean and modern hotel, great atmosphere in the bar downstairs. We had booked a superior room. On requesting a quiet room we were put up on the 3rd floor.... quiet it was not.. Tesco Express outside might have given us a clue, deliveries until late and then again around 5am.. inbetween lots of noisy happy people, resulted in about a measly hours sleep for us... Bathroom is kind of open plan, but that worked ok for us. We got moved to a quieter room at the back of the hotel, which was all they had left on saturday morning when we complained and although it was small, it was definitely quiet. I saw on another review that there is a suite at the back of the hotel, that would be my choice next time. Reception told us it is always noisy on the streetside where the majority of their rooms are. Chilli Pickle Indian restaurant next to the hotel was fabulous. Great food also to be had at Bills, Havana and Jamies Italian. 
0; I stayed here with colleagues on business. I was in a single room. First impressions were great, large room with ornate touches and a premium feel.   The main issue was the temperature. I had the window open, even turned the heated towel rail off In case that contributed. It was so hot I felt ill.   The second issue was no phone signal, and unreliable internet. Whilst the building is a stunning old building, it is impractical for internet to be poor when travelling on business. I asked at reception but their level of knowledge was poor.   For me the hotel is disappointing, and not worth the price. In future I will stay elsewhere. 
0;" This is one of those places that does the job, it offers a comfortable, newly-decorated room in a central location; but you don't feel you are swimming in luxury either. We spent one night and we were happy with our stay. I should say we didn't use any of the facilities of the hotel so we can only comment on the room and the service at check-in and out which were both fine. It's nice that they have free of charge internet (and a Mac!) in the room. My only negative comment is that the mattress was not very comfortable, at least it wasn't for me. Still, we would stay here again if we find another deal. "
0; Myself and my family visited Inglewood Manor on Boxing Day for the gala buffet. At a cost of £35 per person it certainly wasn't cheap. Unfortunately the whole experience from the customer service to the food was very disappointing. Unlike the previous year where we were greeted with drinks in the entrance, this time we just went into the lounge area where drinks were eventually brought to us still wearing our coats (the previous year these were taken and hung up straight away). It was assumed most of us wanted alcoholic ones - which most of us didn't want. After the pre-ordered starters, the main buffet itself was a strange mixture of hot (lukewarm) food and a bit of cold salad stuff - although the salmon was nice. Three of us had the vegetarian starter - none of us could eat it. Everything about it apart from the bread that went with it was wrong. Flavourless mushrooms and the most awful tasting goats cheese - so strong it could blow your socks off. The puddings were very disappointing because of the lack of presentation and choice. It's such a shame because there had been such a wonderful choice the previous year and the meringue with the thick clotted cream and fruit looked quite amazing and tasted delicious. The staff on the day seemed particularly lacking in customer care - perhaps because they were having to work over Christmas. Although it is a lovely venue and probably lovely to stay there we won't be going again apart from maybe for a coffee. 
0;" I was lucky enough to receive an &quot;all inclusive&quot; head to toe pamper day from my husband. I was therefore very surprised when I checked in to be asked for my credit card. Having specified over the phone, the classes I wanted to participate in, I was frustrated when all of my treatments were booked during the classes. I had to reschedule everything. There was never any mention of cost and it was only upon checkout that I realised that not all classes are included. I feel that it's an expensive day out and to have to pay for extras is unreasonable. I also think that the scheduling was poor as you can't swim or sauna after a facial or manicure. I didn't like having to point out that my complimentary orange juice was complimentary either. I won't be returning. "
0; We went up to stay 1 night in london as we were going to a gig and it would be too late to get the train so decided on a hotel.  The hotel itself was quite easy to find down a side road, just around the corner from Kings cross underground station. Getting into the hotel was a bit confusing, no keys etc, press a button and reception will let you in... it is 24hr.  Check in was quick and efficient, fill out a simple form then you get your room key.  The hotel is very clean and quite bright and warm. Although the stairs are very narrow.  Once in our room we had a look around. We unfortunately had a back room which looks out to backs of other buildings which are VERY run down. The room itself was a nice size for the two of us, but would have expected bigger as it has a kitchenette. The bathroom is a great size!! Highlight of the hotel!! Only has a shower though, this was not a problem for us, we prefer showers. The shower was very big!! The bed was extremely comfortable, and when we got back from the gig we had a great night sleep.  Only problems we came across were the heating in the room did not work. There was an in room safe but unfortunately it did not work as someone before us had not reset it!! So now I guess it will be perminently closed as only 1 or 2 people know the code!! Also the tv remote didnt work so before going to sleep we watched a bit of the olympics and had to get up again to turn it off!  The hotel felt safe due to the security system.  Another problem was on checking out, we were told paying by credit card is fine if we were waiting for a new pin number as long as we had ID. When we went to pay, the person said the machine wouldnt accept it. therefore we had to pay cash and card which left us short!!!  Due to the not so good check out, I dont think we will be returning again. It was a nice hotel, but not worth the price. There are better value hotels out there. 
0; Hotel was very nice, friendly staff. Food in restaurant was disappointing, had hoped it would be much nicer but some dishes were a bit bland and small. Good location opposit beach but paper thin walls, and lots of children. 
0; As a 'budget' hotel, it's ok, I didn't feel ripped off for the £69 we paid, but it was in no way exciting or luxurious. The staff aren't the most helpful in the world, and in some instant, a little abrasive. The rooms are very basic and the breakfast isn't something I'd recommend - pricey and devoid of taste and moisture.  Whilst I would stay again, it would be something of a last resort 
0; We stayed here following our return from holiday as part of the APH car park deal. Was pleased we had not paid full price as would have been very disappointed.  The room was adequate but small. The bed side lamps did not work and after investigation we found that the bulbs had been partially unscrewed - perhaps to save electricity?!  The main room light had the cover missing and was just a bare bulb. Seeing as our stay was only one night the numerous suspicious looking hairs in the bath were not worth worrying about as we didnt use it.   Great base for Gatwick though as only ten minutes away which we were grateful of landing at 1am! 
0; My friends and I stayed on a Saturday night and the hotel was pretty much what I expected. We didn't use the pool or fitness area but the rooms were well presented, clean and had all that you could need for one night. Layout of the bathroom was a bit odd with the toilet tucked behind the door - when the door was open it was a bit difficult to move around in the bathroom. Breakfast in the restaurant was good with plenty of choice though very busy. Food was replenished often and it was nice to get a large pot of fresh coffee at the table. All in all a pleasant stay. 
0; Booked for a relaxing break after Christmas. Wish I had read reviews first. The standard room was like a travelodge except this one had a really poor shower and rust around the bath fittings. Lights fused several times during our stay and we were shown how to fix this. Had been booked into The Dukes Grill for the Saturday night but were told at short notice that there was a function on - a wedding. So plans had to be changed. I am sure they would have known further in advance that this was happening. Had a meal in Hadrians Brasserie - the waiter was very courteous but we were sat in what felt like a corridor from the kitchen and so were walked past continually. Food was good but the wine expensive. We have enjoyed better breaks in hotels in the area. 
0; My partner and i stayed for 1 night on 09.08.2014. The room was very small and hot and smelt funny. The bathroom had no door!! which for a lady is not ideal. The pool area (inside) was clean but very very hot, the spa area was also clean and the sauna and steam room were lovely, however the changing rooms where disgusting - overflowing bins - dirty toilet - no toilet roll !! i had a treatment booked for 4pm of which i asked if it could be moved forward, they re-booked this for me to 3.30pm. When i arrived at the treatment rooms they knew nothing of this, then i was not given the treatment I asked for and then was told they didn't have time to do they treatment i wanted even though i was half an hour early. The massage with okay, not good, not bad. The lift did not work and we were on the 3rd floor. There was no kettle in our room yet cups with tea etc... 1 Biscuit for 2 people!!!   The breakfast was lovely and cooked very well - well done to the chef that day.  Good location.  All in all i expect more from a 4* hotel - it is run down and could do with a revamp in all areas (the bar and reception look nice but as soon as you go up the stairs its like a different hotel). 
0;Very helpful and friendly reception staff who gave us directions to the town centre, just a 10 minute walk.We had a corner room on the 5th floor, which was clean and tidy but would have benefitted from a refurb as it looked tired and was well used. Housekeeping delivered 2 extra pillows on request. Excellent 3 course evening meal served by pleasant staff, and again at the hot buffet breakfast. Only complaint was the price of the drinks....take plenty of money!
0; Stayed here for 3 nights whilst on a business trip. Although rated 4 star this is probably for amenities not quality, although room was clean. It's tired and needs updating. Hairdryer not very powerful and you have to keep the power switch pressed down! Take your own if you have long hair!. No heating on despite when booking I was told heating would not be on for first night only due to repairs. Was promised freestanding heater but that never materialised. 
0; I stayed in this hotel with my partner for four days over the August Bank Holiday weekend.  It was OK but I have stayed in better Marriotts before. The decor was a bit tired although everything was clean and the bed extremely comfortable. The actual room layout was great and it had double aspect views. We also had a fridge which was extremely useful  The location was ideal as we had come for the Matthew Street Festival and the hotel was very close to the main stage, so we were able to pop in and out of the hotel to change and use the facilities.  As other guest have stated, the bedroom was hot and the air conditioning appeared not to be working so I had quite a few nights of poor sleep. Once the festival had finished we were able to open the windows and with the aid of ear plugs, the noise outside was not too bad.  The hotel staff were very friendly and couldn't fault them.  Marriott seem to have cut down their allowance of biscuits to one packet per couple, per day, and not very good quality biscuits at that. I know everyone is trying to cut costs at the moment and in the scheme of things this is just a small thing - but it is those little things that mean a lot and make a difference. Was a bit disappointed on this front that Marriott had to be so stingy.  The car park is a rip off at £12 per night. We ended up leaving our car with a friend outside of Liverpool and for our last night put it in the car park next door which costs us next to nothing.  I will stay at this hotel again because of its location and hopefully the hotel will sort their air conditioning out by next year. I will also bring my own biscuits.  Overall it was a nice hotel with just a few things that spoiled it and as I have said I have stayed in better. 
0; Improve on parking. Overall the stay was good but I was not happy about the parking when I had to pay at the end of my stay. You need to allow guests to park free. This is not acceptable especially if you are an overnight guest. 
0; Stayed here for one night at attending a friends party nearby. The wow factor of the building on arrival is great. Room was clean and spacious but there were white stains all over one of the dark walls in the room so clearly this needs cleaning up. Spa facilities and pool etc were lovely. Morning breakfast was lacking asked if we wanted coffee, ordered it and it never came. Food was ok but could have been hotter 
0; The hotel is in a great location a few steps takes you to departures . It's not a cheap place to stay and for £150 I would expect more than one pillow on the bed . It's a no frills room which most airport hotels are . Food ok drinks expensive 
0; I booked the Strand Palace at the last minute, after the location of my London meeting was moved to the Strand. I could not have wished for a better located hotel.  Initially I was worried due to some of the comments on Trip Advisor. OK, I had a single room - which was on the smallish side - but for £55 a night including breakfast it was a great deal. The room was clean and had all the amenities I could have wanted (with the exception of a view).  Staff were courteous and room service was fine. Room service breakfast was fine - continental breakfast plus fruit, cheese, yoghurt and choice of cereals.  I'll definitely go back and stay at Strand Palace either on business or with my husband. 
0; Had a spa day here with overnight stay between Xmas and new year, very nice looking hotel from outside but interior of hotel is in need for total refurbishment. Restaurant is looking very tired with picnic tables folded up leaning against walls, also needs decorating plus a good clean wouldn't go a miss. Food was very basic. Real shame this could be so much better and has the scope to be a good place to go for this area. 
0; I was staying here this weekend (23rd-25th).   Firstly the positives- the food was lovely the first night, the lunch the next day and breakfast. Also good wheelchair access and comfy clean rooms. Think the receptionsits are a credit to the staff they were the nicest there and really welcoming.   Now for the negatives- the food the second night was awful. The chicken's gravy was not gravy it tasted like medicine and the broccoli was brown and old.   The waitering staff and the bar staff did not smile once throughout our stay and they were very rude towards the organiser of our group and made her wait 15 mins to get her drink. They seriously need to learn some customer service skills!   Also if you want a drink after 11:30 you won't get one as they shut the bar!   Would not reccomend and wouldn't come back.    
0; In the main I found staff, particularly in the resturant extremely helpful.- The executive lounge also provided a nice selection of food and drink. The fitness facilities were good and able to enjoy good use of sauna 
0;"I stayed in the King Street Premier Inn from 20 Apr for one night. This was my first stay in a Premier Inn. Firstly, I must say that I cannot fault my experience with any of the staff I encountered. The hotel experience was a little dissapointing, however. First of all, the hotel entrance is actually LITTLE King Street not King Street. As a lone female traveller, arriving after dark well into the evening, it is a little disconcerting to find a pub where you think the hotel should be (turns out that this is the Brewyers Fayer attached to the Premier Inn). When I got to my room I was hit by a wall of heat. This despite the window being open. The heating thermostat was showing over 25degrees with a notice advising that changing the temperature setting will not cool the room. I turned on the provided fan but had no choice but to sleep with the window open. Unfortunately, as with many cities, it didn't go to sleep until gone midnight (so neither did I!). Sadly, as a result of the necessary open window I was awoken by a galss refuse collection between 5-6 am. The temperature reading was 26.2 at this time! Needless to say, I didn't get the good night's rest I was hoping for.  Other than a few minor niggles (chipped mug, broken switch on the kettle, no extra pillows and damp towels) the room was perfectly adequate; the bathroom, particulary the shower, was great and the bed comfy, and I would recommend it for staff service and location. However, unless you can sleep through city noise or you can bare a very warm room, I would recommend that you find somewhere else to stay."
0; We stayed for a friends wedding. Spa changing rooms were filthy... Plasters and hair all over the floor. Was in the pool for an hour and no clesning had been done in that time. No separate changing rooms, i had to change in the toilet. Would of already been in my costume but the fact I had to go outside of the hotel to get to the spa, stopped me from doing this. Annoying! At the bar the waiter was rude when I asked why they served every other branded type of alcohol but had cheap vodka. They ran out of lemonade AND diet coke half way through a wedding. This was rectified but very slowly... We then proceeded to go the the residents bar in the cellar.... What was on sale??? Smirnoff vodka... For the same price. Seemed a little unfair!!!!! Considering drinks weren't cheap! My partners friends all work for a brewery and the beer on tap was flat and smelt bad!!! Not worth the 4 stars this hotel has and certainly not the £90 rate we paid to stay!!!!! Would not stay here again. And if other sister hotels are the same, we wouldn't stay there either!!!! Let alone have a wedding there! But on the other hand the young Lady on reception was delightful. Nicest person there!!!!! 
0;I love helicopters and requested an heliport /riverview. However, don't expect a mobile signal at all. The quadruple glazing renders it impossible to receive any calls. Hotel Verta as was used to be much more upmarket. Now the bedrooms have become quite tired. Saying that staff are very pleasant, especially the bar staff and the bed was super comfy. Complete black out and quietness affords a good night's sleep. The spa is the best, Espa products and a lovely relaxing appointment waiting lounge. The hotel would benefit from some attention on refurbisment but I will certainly return. Oh and don't serve pork scratchings as a snack in the bar please.
0; This is the third time over 20 years we have stayed at this hotel and under 3 different names. We had asked for 2 ground floor rooms for my mother and us. We arrived a day before she did. Went to our ground floor double room and immediately asked for a different room. It was a single room with a double bed in it. Awful. I have a lot of medical equipment and there was no room to put it out. No way could we stay in that for 4 nights. We were given another room (34) which was lovely and large, however it was on the first floor. My mothers room was on the ground floor and was a decent size. Our bathroom was not cleaned very well. The breakfasts were good. The second night there was no fish pie and the third night one of the deserts was not available. By the third and fourth nights the staff were searching the wine cellar for the wine we wanted! The menu is fairly limited and could have been improved by a specials board. However the Chef was excellent. On the Saturday night we had the restaurant to ourselves as everyone else was attending one of the two weddings on. The health club was great. The staff were all very friendly and made our stay. The hotel does need money spent on it to update many of the rooms and public areas. 
0; We stayed here for one night and there were several things that disappointed. On arrival we found our room was not in the main hotel but was in a block of rooms a walking distance away which with luggage in bad weather (it was raining) was not a good start. The room was nice and clean and a good size but the wi fi did not work. The evening meal in Nineteen was quite nice but there was a party of golfers who were rude, noisy and on phones disrupting other guests. To be fair when we complained the cost of two drinks were removed from the bill. We had a disturbed night due to a leaky guttering outside our room which was pointed out when we paid the bill. Breakfast was OK we went in as soon as it opened at 7:00 as we wanted to get an early start and some of the food wasn't even out. The cooked breakfast also took a while to come. All in all the hotel flattered to deceive. We will not be returning. 
0; We recently stayed at this hotel for a friends wedding.  We found the staff to be so helpful and very friendly. We arrived very late and the staff helped us and we really appreciated the fact that the bar was still open.  Our first impressions of the room was really good. It was obviously recently redecorated and it was very large. The only thing that left the room down was the limited number of plug sockets. Most people have phones, laptops etc and there was not enough.  There was a letter stating that the hotel was under going some refurbishment and it was obviously needed in the corridors, stairs and circulation areas. The rooms and the event room were very nice.  We tried the spa on the saturday morning and whilst it was small, it was perfectly formed. For a space to relax in it was spot on. ONce again the staff here were very friendly.  The breakfast offered a good selection of items and choices of cooked breakfasts.  Overall we were happy with the hotel, its facilities and its value for money and whilst it was not the best hotel we have stayed in, if we were in the area we would stay there again. Which I think is a sign of a good hotel. 
0; My partner and I booked one night at £120, everything else was extra and I mean everything including the TV!! They wanted £5 to watch old movies (such as Shrek or Iceage) and offered very limited free TV. Free sat can provide far more but not apparently the Hilton. It really put me off the stayinjg with them again even though the room was lovely and the breakfast excellent. The Thai chicken salad in their restaurant should however be avoided at all costs. It was slimy and tasted like they had simply tipped satay sauce over a basic chicken salad. 
0; We decided to go for dinner, having not been for a couple of years as the weather had put a lot of people off going out we thought we like to support a pub not far away. We hadn't booked but was offered different tables in the restaurant and the menus. We had our drinks order taken and waited for our food order, unfortunately it did take a while and we weren't sure why as there was only 3 other tables in the restaurant. I ordered the duck and my husband went for the steak, no starters. The food took 50minutes to arrive, we were then starving, there had been no apology for the wait and we had asked twice when would the food come. The food was taster and my husbands chips were delicious. We were asked if we wanted dessert, we said we look at the menus but then again after another 15mniutes before we saw a waiter again we decided just to ask for the bill and leave. We have only one course in the 1.5hours we were there a real disappointment but what we had was lovely. Maybe they need more staff or the kitchen was short staffed we just don't know 
0;Very comfortable hotel with a great receptionist. We booked it only few hours before and had a decent room with decent bathroom on ground floor. Also nice that you have a mini kitchen in the room with tea/coffee and also microwave is provided. Beds is as I found them comfortable for a good night's sleep.  Negative feedback is that there is no room service. No minibar. And then there was quiet a bad smell in the room while we lived there. We should of course had informed the reception but as we were only going to spent few hours there due to going out it didn't bother us too much. If though we needed to spent more days there I would definitely had said something, no doubt.
0;" We stayed/party here for our first time last night. The hotel is large,well maintained and with very friendly staff. Black tie celebrations were very good,food adequate,slightly slow at clearing dirty plates away! Bar staff very pleasant. Rooms large, comfatable beds but my biggest complaint would be our room( on the 5th floor) was cold!! No heating or heated towel rail in the bathroom!! Reception reassured us &quot; it was working, up to 22temp !!! Felt more like 16deg!! Need to move to the 2000 century with heated bathrooms! "
0; Stayed one night when working away. Room was large and clean if a little tired around the edges. It looked out onto some open walkway not far from houses and there was some noise from people passing by underneath the hotel (via this walkway). Friendly checkin and if you are here for shopping it's in a cracking location near the Cabot Circus shopping centre (and a huge Five Guys if you are into your burgers). Breakfast was ok - restaurant downstairs is a bit dark and 'hidden away' and service was a bit lacklustre. There was a good selection of food though. All in all it's an ok option but I have stayed in better places in Bristol. Not sure of the price as it was booked through work! 
0; We booked an Executive Deluxe room for 2 nights to celebrate my husband's birthday. The room looked great on first inspection as we had a separate living area and bedroom but on close inspection the carpets were badly stained and there were scratches and holes in the furniture. The bathroom was horrid, it was filthy. Although spacious, and clearly designed for disabled guests the toilet was almost under the sink (no idea why with all the space), the shower was covered in mould and the showerhead a health risk. The bathroom mirror frame had lost most of it's paintwork, the tap on the sink and shower seat were broken and a thick layer of dust covered most surfaces - need I go on! I'm a Hilton loyalty card holder so usually quite a fan, but this was definitely the worst I have stayed in. At least the bed was as comfy as I you would expect from this chain. 
0; I went to the hotel for lunch with a group of colleagues. We had pre-ordered but still had to wait for the food and when it came it was not all at once. The waiter did not know what he was doing and people had to go on ahead and eat their meals as they would have got cold whilst others had to wait. My meal came right at the end after most people had finished and it was only a jacket potato! Most meals were cheap but at a cost of quality and amount. A waitress did apologise but no excuse for service. Will not be going again in a hurry. 
0;The hotel is ideally situated in Reading TC however that has its drawbacks. We had a room at the front overlooking the road which was noisy all night. The food in the restaurant was average and most of the staff in the restaurant were abrupt and direct. The reception staff were helpful and friendly. Watch out for the car park as we had difficulty getting out even though we had paid through the hotel. I doubt I would stay again.
0; I attended an event recently at the hotel and liked the ambience, especially the garden so decided to try the Beeches restaurant for dinner. There is a new menu with a new chef and the corn fed chicken with bacon and peas we ordered was excellent, as were the desserts. Unfortunately we felt we were eating in a hotel coffee shop as there was no atmosphere. A group were in the restaurant lining up for the carvery and there was a table to one side piled high with crockery. On leaving we walked through the bar/lounge area where people were having drinks/coffees and it had a nice feel. It would be a big improvement if the hotel could do something with the dining room to create a similar ambience. 
0; Lovely hotel with excellent staff. The restaurant was very quiet for a Saturday lunch time but this was compensated by superb waiting staff.The food looked attractive but it was sadly let down by being lukewarm and served on cold plates.This was a shame and a little disappointing considering the reputation of the head chef. 
0;I have always loved this hotel and the adjoining Smoak restaurant from my very first visit - so the fact that my significant other booked a romantic evening away whilst we were child-free was a big win. He had even taken the time to call the hotel to give advance notice of a specific steak which we would like, as the advice was to 'book it in advance' to ensure there was one available. So we arrived at the hotel at about 3.15pm, and whilst it took a little while to check in, there were no issues really. We upgraded the room to one of the suites, and ordered Afternoon Tea (for two). The room was not yet ready and was still being made up by housekeeping (which is not an issue as we had only just done the upgrade), so we handed the case over to the receptionist and made our way to the bar area for our afternoon tea. Here comes the first part of the disappointment ..... it took over an hour and half from ordering it to it arriving. The restaurant wasn't busy, the bar was busy but not overflowing, and the afternoon tea was a mini-burger, 2 wraps, a scone and various pieces of cake etc - so nothing needing cooking. An apology was given, and a free drink too. However, then comes the second disappointment - the afternoon tea that was delivered was only for one person - not two as had been ordered and paid for up front. However, by this time we were starving so tucked into the tea for one - which was actually really lovely although quite laden in the dessert / sweet space and not overly laden with savoury. We had thought that the free drink for the wait was a free drink each - however this was also not the case as they had delivered tea for one - so the drink was also in the singular. I would like to point out though that the wonderful lady working behind the bar really did exude all of the positives of the Mal brand - she was attentive, friendly and boy did she work hard as she was on her own behind the bar for much of the time we were there. So, we drew a line under this experience and went to the room. Huge room, really lovely (I have stayed in the sister suite to this one before so knew what to expect) but there was a really heavy smell of smoke near the windows - the previous occupant had obviously had the window open and been puffing away through it - a safe way to ensure no smoke alarms were going off. We did make sure that the staff were made aware, and they did send someone up to try and sort it whilst we were at dinner. So .... dinner. The bit I had been really looking forward to. We went into the restaurant - and were taken to a booth looking out over the street (which we had specifically asked for - so this was a really good start as many places can't even get this type of things right). A lovely young waiter came and brought menu's and took drinks orders - and as with the lady behind the bar he was just lovely - attentive, friendly, and professional. However when we came to order the steaks that had been pre-ordered earlier in the week we were advised that there were none, we made a second selection - that wasn't available either. This was when my other half saw red and asked to speak to someone more senior. Rather than create a scene in the restaurant my other half went to find the Duty Manager, Victoria Joy, and in initial conversation took place away from our table - then she came over to speak to the two of us. I need to be very clear here that Victoria could not have done more for us than she did, she was absolutely amazing and was herself very disappointed with the issues that we had come up against. She even went so far as to speak to the chef's and came up with an amazing alternative to the step dilemma - really impressive. Again, a fantastic ambassador for the Mal company and someone who really did think on her feet quickly and react with compassion, empathy and with the customer at the forefront of her mind at all times. I will also take the time to say that steaks that we did have were incredible - cooked to perfection to be honest. They really do know what they are doing in the kitchen in Smoak. Victoria called at the table a few times during the evening to check on how things were - and we were very grateful to her for the steps she took to resolve the predicament and to make amends. She even went so far as to organise some take-out bags for breakfast as she knew we had to dash from the hotel to the airport first thing on Monday morning (however we were not able to take advantage of this due to the flight arrival being well ahead of planned time so we needed to dash early - before breakfast started - to pick up my daughter unfortunately). Back up to the room after the meal - Victoria had arranged drinks back in the room for us as another positive gesture. Once there I decided to make full use of the facilities - which included an amazing bath. I was looking forward to using the lovely bath products which I received last time we were in one of these suites - only to find they no longer do them. This was disappointing too as they were great - so I now wanted a bath, and there was no bubble bath (shower gel available in the bathroom for the shower, shampoo and soap also there, but no bubble bath). Gutted. However after questioning the lack of the products we had expected to see (based on experience at the end of 2015) then they did rush out and bring back some bubble bath for me. Really lovely - but just not the same as the experience I had expected. I did however have a great nights sleep in a very comfy huge bed, with the best pillows I have ever laid my head on, just lovely. The best I think of anywhere I have stayed. Then, whilst rushing around getting ready in the morning I went to clean my teeth and found that both the hot and the cold taps deliver warm water. No way could I get the cold tap on its own to run cold water. Not ideal again.  Checkout wasn't a great experience either - with additional drinks that should not have been billed, being added to the bill (but were swiftly removed by the receptionist) Lots of consecutive negative elements to the experiences this weekend, and had it not been for the efforts of Victoria then I think the rating here would be closer to zero if I am honest. I have never had any issues before, and I was beyond disappointed - as was my other half. However, Victoria could not have done more to try and remediate the issues and also to restore our faith in the brand - a brand that she very clearly believes in. We had already got another break booked here - and had it not been for the likes of Victoria then we would have cancelled it without batting an eyelid - however, as a result of her influencing and her passion - then we will return and hopefully we will have the positive experience that we have been used to in the past. I really hope so, as I have loved previous stays here.
0; This place has beautiful views. We have just spent one night at the hotel with use of the spa facilities we were really excited as we were celebrating my graduation. On arrival the receptionist was very rude. She asked us about our journey then cut my husband short half way through answering her question. She then informed us the room wasn't ready and that was it. We asked what we should do .. Ect she said we could go for a drink .. She didn't even tell us where the bar was! We found the bar returned to reception 40 mins later as we had lunch booked ( we weren't told what time or where to go) she looked at us in a very distasteful manner when we returned to reception and told us we could play golf or something !! WHAT? Play golf! I'm there for a spa weekend! Basically she just wanted us any where but at the reception! She told us lunch was at one thirty we then had to ask about our spa times etc we were given no details or directions to anywhere. By this point we had literally had enough she was SO rude I wanted to return home it put such a downer on what should have been a lovely relaxing welcome !! We finally found the restaurant went to get some food from the buffet and there was basically no food there and the kitchen closed at 2:00 which gave us 30 mins to eat what little food was left. Shocking. Finally got to our room just gone two and feeling very fed up. The spa staff were nice as were the facilities - shame there are no loungers outside as your very limited to seat out there. Had a pedicure which was good. Dinner was nice although not a massive selection and breakfast was enjoyable although object again staff are not particularly helpful. I won't be rushing back the entire stay cost over £300 and I would expect for that money much better customer service. It really did ruin the trip. Our room was also next to the road so it was very very loud. Such a shame.  We won't be returning and think that the staff need some serious training in hospitality and politeness - after all manners cost nothing!!   If I were looking I'd go to a different spa. very disappointed 
0;"We had been staying at the Cavendish hotel since our honeymoon in 1991 and always returned a few times every year. The hotel is in a beautiful setting and the Inn rooms are perfect for a lazy few days and nights. The staff were always friendly and helpful without being intrusive and it had always been a delight to visit, despite the expense. Unfortunately, there was a change of restaurant management last year and after persuading friends to travel from Berkshire to join us over a weekend for my husbands 60th birthday in July 2011, we were all very disappointed with our experience. During our visit, our experience of the new Manager was that he lacked the customer care skills required to manage an hotel of this standing. He also lacked the warmth we had previously enjoyed and actually thought it acceptable to bully us into going to our table early, because the food was ready 30 minutes before the time we had booked it for. We were embarassed at having persuaded our friends to travel nearly 200 miles to join us and frankly haven't felt inclined to return since. It's a real shame for us as we have lost our &quot;bolt hole&quot;, but also for the hotel who has lost our business and recommendations."
0; Stayed one night, service at check in was good, room was smart, clean and well equipped.   Only issues were broken sink - you couldn't pull the plug out so water filled up- and a toilet that got blocked easily and almost flooded!   Other than that, nice quiet room and very good discounted rate so can't complain. As with all chain hotels, could be seen as sterile or lacking charm but doesn't bother me. 
0; Cold room where heating control could only be regulated by reception each time I wanted the room hotter or cooler. Reception forgot to carry out my requests until I physically went down to repeat my request. Only one set of toiletries for 2 people. TV audio only working in bathroom. Beautiful bedding. 
0; Stayed here one night after an error made with a different booking. Right on the market square of which we had the perfect view for our room.  All staff we came across were lovely and welcoming, had a big bed which was very comfy and the breakfast was cooked to perfection and set us up for the day  The only reason I'm giving 3stars as previously mentioned some areas were a bit tired looking and I would've liked a bit more of a modern shower.  However I do appreciate that this is a 'coach house' so to speak not a 5* hotel, and the character of the building and the friendly staff were well worth the visit 
0; Our daughter and new son in law got married here last weekend and the Service was 1st class - 5* - could not fault any of the preparation the clearing of the ceremony room dining room or service. Thank you so much for making the day so memorable.  As the review is of the hotel cannot give quite the same recommendation. There is no pool which you would might expect in a 4* hotel - the room appears to have no mirror - there is a mirror but is in a place you cannot really see yourself outside the bathroom door.  Check in is really late 3pm - with the wedding ceremony beginning at 3pm this is too late for the guests to check in and get ready for the ceremony - although ours was ready earlier - we asked if we could check in and they were accommodating.  Staff were really nice especially the wedding co-ordinators especially work so very hard.  Breakfast the following morning was plentiful, the room was as expected large tv and free internet in the rooms.   Check out is 11 am we had to clear the wedding ceremony chair covers/sashes/table decorations/sweet trolley etc which the hotel had stored and cleared very well for us.  My husband helped clear our room with our little grandson. About 5 hours after we left the hotel I realised the clothing I had stored in the wardrobe at the hotel was missing. I asked my husband if he had brought it in his car and he said not. I knew immediately that the clothing was in the hotel wardrobe. I returned immediately and waited patiently whilst the hotel staff tried to locate my clothing. The room was already re occupied.  After about 1/2 hr waiting in the reception area they had not come back to me - I was quite upset as mother of the bride the clothes were important. They said that they had checked with housekeeping and lost property and also checked the rooms and they had not been found. A male member of staff said he felt that a family member must have taken them home. I left the hotel feeling very upset and knowing that my wedding clothes had been left in the wardrobe.  About an hour or so later the hotel rang to say that the clothing 3 dresses and a jacket had been located on a trolley by the head housekeeper somewhere in the hotel.  Although the items have been retrieved and returned and it was my fault I left them there I think that the housekeeping procedure has let the hotel down. The lost items should have been taken to lost property immediately = the hotel knew who had stayed in the room and it would have been wonderful if they had courteously rang to ask if we had left anything in the room.  I have emailed the Hilton Ageas Bowl but they have neither acknowledged my email or apologised.   A simple procedural rectification and a telephone call when the room was initially cleaned could have made all the difference.  We have travelled extensively and the best service makes the best hotels. 
0; After reading reviews booked direct with hotel to stay 1 night as visiting friends and family in the local area. On arrival all boded well. Building well presented and a pleasant and efficient at check-in experince. On arrival in room 8, was pleased to a have a room overlooking the garden and thus quieter. There was however though a few things that let the room down. Both the bedside lampshades were broken, The courtesy tray was unplugged and difficult to access the socket. The light in the shower didin't work. The once white towels were a decidedly grey in colour. The hook on the back of the bathroom door was broken. The metal stand in the bathroom was showing signs of rust. The room just looked tired and need a lick of paint and a little bit of TLC. Breakfast was perfectly adequate, but if there is one reqrest, please, please, please serve 1 decent sausage which was locally sourced rather than 2 catering sausages with little or no meat. On checking out I wasn't asked if I had had a pleasant stay. They are not major things in there own right, but they do all add up and take the edge of what could be potentially a better experience. 
0; Myself, my husband and two friends called at The Feathers for a meal on Sunday evening. It was very busy and we chose to eat outside in the courtyard. Although a waitress brought us the menus she could not take our order for either food or drinks so we had to go inside to order, which did seem a bit strange but wasn't really a problem. Three of us had the roast beef which came with potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and individual dishes of vegetables. We were all really hungry, and looking forward to a lovely Sunday roast. However, the meal was so disappointing. The beef was okay, not the most tender I have ever eaten, the roast potatoes were soggy, and the roast parsnips were over cooked and were so chewy they were practically inedible. The dish of vegetables was carrots and red cabbage, bland and uninspiring. However, the worst thing about the meal was the gravy, which was most peculiar. It was extremely thick and gloopy and spread all over the meat. It tasted more like a thick oxtail soup with tomato purée. We all commented on how strange it tasted, it really was not nice at all. Based on this meal we all said that none of us would eat again at the Feathers hotel, which is such a shame as it looks like a lovely hotel and is in a superb position in the centre of the town. 
0; We stayed for 3 nights and thought it was really nice, but didnt quite deserve the 4 stars. The television was old and it did not have full sky television like the website says. There were a few other chanels besides the normal ones, so nothing major. The apartment was boiling hot when we arrived on the Friday night and the main heater was a storage one that we couldnt switch off. Reception happily sent someone up with a fan but, which was good. We really liked the high ceilings and space - it really felt like we were staying in our own apartment. They left us a little bottle of milk and plenty tea, coffe and sugar. The maids filled the dish washer and put it on when we were out, which was great. We did get a wake up call one morning which we didnt ask for, but luckily we were already out of bed or else I wouldnt have been very happy. We found the place overpriced, but altogether a nice place to stay. We would definately consider it again (but a lower price would be an added incentive). The location was brilliant - right next to Picadilly Station. Oh - and although we saw groups of people staying for hen or stag dos - we encountered no noise. The free wi-fi was a great addition too. 
0; We got married at this hotel 5 years ago. We tried to book a table for three weeks prior to our anniversary and never got a reply even though we left messages. We had decided not to bother with the booking after such poor service, but after a re-think and as it is a special place for us, decided to go head and book. When we finally managed to get through to the hotel we explained about the problems we had experienced with booking and it was our anniversary. We arrived to no welcome, young staff who were trying to assist but not experienced. The restaurant had no atmosphere and food was so disappointing. Food was cold and although we really enjoy nouvelle cuisine dinning this was ridiculous. We like other reviews on trip-advisor left feeling extremely hungry. We did not complain as we agreed we would not be visiting again. My husband and I are people who enjoy small meals, but this is a joke. We decided to skip the desert, and headed to a local store to buy desert and cheese. Our wedding we thoroughly enjoyed because we organized it, but the service here has not changed. 
0;" This is a review of the restaurant, not the hotel. I attended a Sunday lunchtime family birthday get together on a sunny Sunday afternoon in August. The building and gardens are beautiful, the staff attentive and the atmosphere relaxed. However.............. I am bored to death of being offered one option on a menu just because I happen to abstain from eating meat. The Sunday lunch menu had Goat's Cheese salad as the only (V) Starter and some kind of vegetable tart (I forget the filling it was so un-original) and yet more salad for the main. The price for my 'meal' was obscene, I felt robbed and worse, still hungry at the END of the meal. My family were a little embarrassed as they tucked into their roast dinners and I 'tucked' into my second salad. If the restaurant truly catered for vegetarians (and by that I mean offering a variety of tantalising vegeatrian dishes that do not contain goat's cheese as this has become as old fashioned as cheese and pineapple on a stick) they wouldn't lob one vegetable based thing on the menu calling it the 'vegetarian choice'. It's not a choice if there is no decision to be made. You know what, the roast dinner without the meat would have been great. Loads of veges, potatoes and gravy, some of my family were so full they couldn't finish thiers! Simple, cost effective for the restaurant and yummy and filling for vegetarians. But this wasn't an option and one doesn't like to start picking apart the menu and one is getting irratated by being told &quot;you could have told us what you would have liked and we would have cooked it for you&quot;. What a cop out! I'm not a chef nor am I paid to be one. Why should I tell a chef what to cook? Verdict: Vegetarian food overpriced, depressingly un-original and served in stingy portion sizes. I am reliably informed by my family that the meat dishes were great! "
0;" My boyfriend and I stayed here a few weeks ago, and we were rather indifferent about out experience. The staff were friendly, and we were upgraded as our room keys didn't work initially. However, for the price you pay per night, the room size was nothin special. We have stayed in other hotels for less, with bigger rooms! Having said that, it was clean and well stocked.  The breakfast, a &quot;buffet&quot; for £12, was disappointing. There wasn't a great deal on offer, and we had to queue to be seated!  Location is good, close to Shepard's bush tube station, and Westfield shopping centre; around a 5-10 minute walk.  Overall, I wasn't largely impressed by my stay here, and I wouldn't return on my next visit to London. You definitely pay for the name 'Hilton' rather than the experience. "
0; I had a voucher for a cream tea as a present and decided to use it today. I phoned and booked the tea for 3p.m. Duly arrived and got given a seat next to the kitchen. there was only one other choice of seating in the middle of a room surrounded by people in comfy chairs, we would have stuck out like a sore thumb. After 25 minutes of waiting I went to the bar and asked where our cream tea was. We were asked if anyone had come to take out order etc. The answer was no! We were brought our cream tea after another 10 minutes and to say I was disappointed was an understatement. The sandwiches were ham no mustard, salmon with no cream cheese, cucumber, and something else which we couldn't quite make out what it was. The dreadful thing about it all was the scones. They were literally no bigger than a 50 p piece. Will not be visiting this hotel again. 
0; Checking into the Grand Harbour hotel, every thing looked really nice. Entering our room (352) every thing looked really nice. Then we went onto the balcony, which we had paid a lot of money for, only to find bottle tops, weeds growing some a foot high, and the railings covered in rust. Luckily I only got rust on my arm and not on my clothes. The toilet flush was very hard to flush as there seemed to be no water pressure. Only one dressing gown was provided and no slippers, which again you pay for in the executive rooms. We had lunch in the bar and breakfast in the restaurant and both were good. Didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening as couldn't find a menu anywhere to show what food they served. Overall we were disappointed with this hotel, not really 4 star. 
0; I stayed here with a friend late August for a night and to use the spa. The room was in the newer part of the hotel and was one of the newer rooms, I noted people had mentioned some of the rooms looked tired. Whilst the room was newer the furniture was cheap, with laminate edging missing form the coffee table. The bed was large and comfortable though and the room was clean, couldn't fault it there.  The spa was nice, not the largest and there was a hen do there on the day we arrived who were of the screechy type, but that wasn't the hotels fault. There were no gowns or slippers in the locker as there should have been though and the jacuzzi was cold, as I've noted a couple o other people had mentioned previously so this is clearly an ongoing issue. We both had full body massages though and they were both brilliant, the therapists were lovely!  We ate in the restaurant that night, the menu was a set menu, my only concern being that there weren't any gluten free options. I'm not strict but it did mean not being able to eat the pasta that came with the fish.  The staff were all friendly and helpful but the hotel was clearly very busy (there was a wedding on that night in a marquee our room overlooked that it would've been nice to have been warned about) and the service suffered a little because of this. I had to ask three times at dinner for some soda water and they'd got my drinks order wrong and the breakfast options weren't replenished quick enough.  Overall, I would probably recommend this hotel and spa but for a midweek option when it wasn't so busy. And i'd make sure the jacuzzi was warm first! 
0;" This was our 3rd stay here over a period of about 6 years and on this stay we found it quite underwhelming. Very busy reception area that spills into the bar - very loud and frantic atmosphere. The room was very disappointing - the 3rd different room style we have had but the smallest and most ordinary - not worth the money - the bathroom very basic with just a shower attachment over the bath. Tiny window, so very dark and claustrophobic. Previous rooms have had a much more luxurious feel and were more spacious - one had a lovely roll top bath and a lot of character. The hotel in my opinion has changed in its ambience and isn;t anything special. We had dinner on the Friday evening in the Brassiere and it was pretty bad. "
0;We stayed for one night and had an Executive Twin Room - rather small and dark. We found the bathroom basin tap was very loose and also the shower temperature was tepid, not very good for November, maybe acceptable on a hot day! There was also a missing light bulb in a standard lamp and only one hand towel. Lumpy foam pillows. Trivial stuff but not really acceptable for a room of this price which was £130. I'm sure Duncan would not be impressed!  We had dinner at another location so can't comment on the evening meal situation, but tasty breakfast and as much as you want. Our waitress Josephine was exceptionally jolly and helpful.  The poor room experience was mitigated by a reduction in the bill at check-out but these are small things that housekeeping needs to check and rectify before new guests come in. I would return but would probably pay out for a better room. Maybe that's what they intend all along!
0; We arrived for our overnight stay and was highly impressed by the receptionist and the Manager (didn't introduce himself so guessing), who was there when we checked in. He immediately gave us 2 crabbing kits together with some bait from the kitchen. I was really impressed by this - he made us feel extremely welcome. We had a great couple of hours crabbing and was so addicted to it, we went out again the next day before we left to drive back to London. Our room was really really nicely decorated - no view but it was a standard room so didn't expect one particularly. it was extremely clean as was the lovely bathroom. Our only disappointment with the room was the tiny television!  Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the swimming pool/spa. My son and his friend (both 13) were only allowed to swim for an hour in the evening (5-6 or possibly to 6.30) and 8.30 to 10.00 in the morning. It was either miss breakfast completely or just have a quick swim, get changed and then eat. The pool is quite small, but the chemicals they use in the pool was absolutely overpowering. Both boys spent the rest of the day bathing their eyes with water as they could hardly open them due to the stinging. They had to sit at breakfast with a wet flannel over their eyes, as they could hardly open them! The breakfast was incredibly poor - the food was absolutely fine, but I can't recall having such bad service in years! The young staff that served us were not at all welcoming, friendly or helpful. I waited for nearly 15 minutes before anyone came to my table to ask if I wanted anything to drink. Then a further 20 minutes to take our order and quite possibly the same again if not longer for it to arrive - and be wrong after all that! The waiting staff and their attitude really lets the hotel down, they should either employ people who actually wants to work and understands customer service.  Such a shame as our initial impression was really good, but this is not a child friendly hotel and the food service leaves an awful lot to be desired! 
0;" Check in was a nightmare. I'd requested a twin room and asked for it to be a quiet one since I was travelling with my elderly mother. I was already disappointed that the hotel didn't have a lift- but that was my fault for not checking.  Check on time was 14.00. I arrived at 13.50 and reception couldn't allocate a quiet twin room because &quot;the system hadn't been updated.&quot;  We finally checked in at 14.15. The room was very clean and a good size but what we didn't know was that it directly above the service entrance and from the early hours of the following morning all we could hear were staff chatting outside and trundling service containers in and out of the door below. The window didn't shut properly and so what double glazing there was, was totally ineffective.  If we'd been staying more than one night we would have asked to be moved.   Breakfast was a joke. They serve until 10.00 and we arrived in the restaurant at 9.15. There were no staff in the restaurant and so we seated ourselves and helped ourselves to what was left of the hot buffet. The dried up baked beans, watery orange juice and one scruffy piece of bacon didn't really add to the appeal of what was a very disappointing experience.   We certainly won't be returning to this hotel and wouldn't recommend it unless there was absolutely no room anywhere else in Colchester. We have never been made to feel less welcome anywhere in the UK and when I mentioned all of the above at check out, the girl apologised and moved on to the next customer.  We really meant nothing at all. "
0;A quiet hotel in a good location Seems there were lots of people going on for cruises in Southampton   Room had all the facilities that we needed for one night stay, comfortable bed, bath and shower, a fridge and tea/coffee making facilities   Breakfast was a buffet style with lots of variety.   Would have liked the pool to be open a bit later in the evening and the sports bar was very cold and lacked atmosphere   We ended up with a good deal from booking.com but wouldn't pay the full daily tariff.   Would stay again if the price was right.
0; Having just got back from a two night trip with my boyfriend to the supposed '4 star luxury country house hotel', I have to say overall I was pretty disappointed with the hotel accommodation as in my opinion it contrasted greatly with the description on laterooms, and was nothing more than a glorified travel lodge, with an extremely expensive breakfast at additional cost of £14.95 per person, which we didn't go for. The rooms were to a generally clean standard but very basic, and we were given a twin initially even though we booked a double, and so were moved to a double on our second night which was slightly cleaner, as the twin had dirty teaspoons and our spare towel had dark yellow stains on it, we did not use it. The pool facilites were however very nice and we made the most of the pool and jacuzzi, but apart from that did not spend much other time in the hotel other than to sleep (there was a very very noisy wedding party on the first night which we were not warned about). I couldn't fault this hotel if it did what it said on the tin,however it was described as something much grander than what it actually is, and the main picture of the building is actually not the main accomodation block, so don't be fooled by the historical and beautiful looking reception building, as the rooms are housed in unattractive blocks alongside the gorgeous reception building. 
0; Stayed just one night here. The hotel is incredibly attractive and set in stunning grounds. The public areas are impressive and the staff helpful. The pool, sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi were nice but the changing rooms were pretty dated. The bedrooms are also very dated (1980's teak everywhere). The hotel manager clearly runs the hotel well but desperately needs an injection of capital to bring things up to standard from the hotel chain owners - hopefully this will happen very soon before the hotels reputation and ratings slip further. This deserves to be a 5* hotel. 
0; If you're considering booking one of the basement rooms at HdV Harrogate - don't! I had one of the worst experiences of my life in the basement room under check-in. The room was dingy with none of the frills you'd expect from HdV - like a roll-top bath. The shower didn't have enough hot water, light came streaming in from the window above the door, making it difficult to sleep, and the room was too hot. But the worst thing was the noise - day and night I could hear people's conversations, the scraping of tables and chairs and general goings on above. The website does warn of a risk of some noise, but the level was ridiculous. I eventually moved to a room within the hotel which was much better and much more what I would expect - beautiful roll-top bath, huge shower etc. The manager of the hotel was apologetic and did everyhitng to ensure I had a good night's sleep form then on in. If you're booking one of the main rooms, I'd say this hotel is wonderful. Jsut don't try the basement. A group of eight of us ate in the bistro as well, which we thought was excellent. However, there is no gym anymore at HdV, which is a pain. The Cannons they have a link up with is nice but the taxi was £6.50 each way and entrance was £7.50. You cna get a little train from Harrogate one stop to near the gym so I'd just do that. 
0; We had a recent stay at Chimney House Hotel with a Groupon voucher for a 2 night stay with one evening main course. We were greeted with a warm welcome by the receptionist did not get her name and she was very helpful. On arrival in the room it has very clean bedding and bathroom. The decor looks like it wants a refurb reading some of the previous comments they must have had a room that has had a refurb. It a good job the curtains were very thick has this kept the cold out all the windows need to be replaced, I appreciate things take time. The hot water was not very hot and there was a portable heater in the room.  The evening meal was nice but the staff were not very pleasant as they looked unable to cope with demand as it was very busy on the Saturday night and there seemed to be confusion at times as to where the food was going. A the bar when ordering 2 halves of lager we were told they had no half pint glasses and we were given the drinks in 2 pint glasses.  Breakfast is too much serve yourself for a hotel offering a pot of tea would be so much nicer than a drinks machine.  I think if this hotel can make a few changes it would be fine as it is in a lovely setting and handy for many local attractions in the area.  J&A from Yorkshire 
0; Room was average. The fans provided were just not helping! Our window was nailed up so we couldn't open them. Staff were friendly, breakfast was pretty good. Lifts are slow. Loved Brighton though! Perfect location. 
0;" My partner booked this as a Christmas present for us, thinking it would be a lovely and luxurious spa day, and we were very much looking forward to it. We did not arrive until 12 noon and were worried that we would not have enough time there, but in fact I could not imagine needing any longer. Reception was ok, not manned and had to wait, then a very young male member of staff bumbled about and showed us around half of the venue, then took us through for lunch which had been pre-booked for us, and told us that our Thallasotherapy treatment was booked for 3pm. Lunch was nice, a good enough choice but not extensive, the restaurant was like a cafe, nothing terribly plush about it, and quite small. We then went through to the changing rooms to get ready for the pool, I was surprised that they were rather small and a bit tired looking. The pool room was lovely, a huge pool with a vaulted roof, lots of light and huge windows...BUT, there were 4 chairs and 5 loungers, hardly great for relaxing. The pool was a little cold, and the &quot;This is a whirlpool, not a jacuzzi&quot; was too cold to be enjoyable. What is the point of it? There was a little room off the pool, a quiet room, with some soft bed/loungers, again a little tight for space. There were no doors to the outside of the pool, which was disappointing, and no loungers outside anywhere. The Thallasotherapy suite was nice, a 30 minute treatment, nice jets but nothing special, and the room needed redecorating, mouldy and rusty in places. The mixed steam/-sauna was broken, therefore we could not use together as a couple and had to used the ones in the changing rooms, defeating the point of coming together. Afternoon tea was included in the package so we went back to the restaurant but were told we had to book it, I explained that we had not been informed on check-in and I felt, that the waiter rather begrudgingly accepted this but told us it would be approx 20 minutes. Not terribly friendly. We sat outside, but again, there were not many tables. After this , we wandered back to the pool area but the seats were all full so did not feel there was anywhere else to go. We went to the changing rooms. One toilet was broken in the ladies, and the showers needed updating, were very claustrophobic and dark, with a rather unfresh smell in the area. There were no candles in the changing rooms, no smelling oils, none of the nIce scents usually found in relaxing spas. Towels, shampoo, conditioner and lotion, plus more available. Overall, very disappointing. I like to go the spa to feel relaxed, to lounge with a drink, a book, have a nice swim, maybe a treatment and relax some more. I belong to Nirvana which is far better , with lots of relaxation areas, never a shortage of loungers, beautiful outdoor garden with pool and proper hot tubs. Champneys completely missed this. Yes, beautiful grounds set in the forest, a very pretty property but far too many missed opportunities. The schedule for the day looked good, but I go to the gym for classes, I use the spa for something completely different. It is too expensive to go to and not enjoy, or feel able to relax. "
0;We used to spend a lot of time in Southwold some years back, and The Crown was our favourite place. The food and wines were always great, the atmosphere bright and buzzing. We’d stayed there a few times, and always enjoyed ourselves - the rooms were plain, but clean and unpretentious. So, when we were looking for a much-needed Christmas treat, it made sense to go back, and we booked two double rooms, one standard, one superior. We booked for two nights, the minimum allowed over the festive season. There was little difference in the rooms - apart from size, despite a difference in cost. The superior one (ours) was chilly, the bed was seriously poor, the carpet was stained - the standard room, although more out of the way, was smaller, but actually nicer. The member of staff who showed us to our room commented how cold it was and apologised - she tried to get the radiators working properly, with no lasting success. There was a portable heater under a table - obviously this was not a new issue with this room, and we discovered from other guests that they had abandoned this room on previous stays thanks to the cold... that was disappointing to hear.  The bathroom was a decent size, and had plenty of very nice toiletries available, quality white towels and bathrobes. But the ceiling over the bath was badly marked with mould, the glass folding shower screen was in very poor condition, and there was peeling paint above the shower. Not exactly welcoming for a long soak with a glass of Christmas wine and a good book! We were told that neither The Crown nor The Swan (Adnam's main hotel in Southwold) was full over Christmas, and we began to see why this might be. We were also told that the hotel would be completely refurbished in 2012.   The food was good, as were the wines. We ate in the bar on Christmas Eve - it was not possible to book a table, and that had been the cause of worry on the journey up - where would we eat if we couldn't get a table. In the event - we needn't have worried - there were plenty of tables available. Oh dear...  We knew there was nothing organised, apart from Christmas lunch, and that suited us fine. We went for long walks - the town and its surroundings are brilliant for walking. We had booked Christmas lunch for 3 pm - and came back from a walk to find the restaurant and bar were packed, the atmosphere much much better than the evening before, and the kitchen served almost 100 very decent lunches, plenty of choice - and certainly not all turkey. Much enjoyed - and the staff were happy - cheerful, a pleasure to be around - even though they'd given up their own Christmases. The chef came out to say hello - he'd been up since 7.30 am with his own kids...a nice touch and much appreciated.  The cooked breakfasts were very good indeed. On Christmas Day we were offered a complimentary buck’s fizz on the house - but again, something felt wrong - the cereals and so forth looked a little sparse on their table - a single dish of yogurt, a small dish of compote, and a jug or two of juice... not really very exciting. However - a nice touch - boiled eggs came in gorgeous, amusing hand-knitted cosies. I asked if I could buy them, and that didn't present a problem.   On check-out, I mentioned the chilly nature of the superior room (I'd been reading wrapped up in a duvet - there is no sitting room at The Crown -) - and said how poor the bed was. Suggested the staff ought to try them out ...and I was expecting a token reduction in price as a result. Hmph. Wishful thinking!  Overall - we enjoyed our stay, but felt that for what we paid, The Crown did not deliver value for money. Those who stay after refurbishment will benefit - and the prices now probably reflect the correct levels for a fresh, fully-functioning building. The staff are very good - but we reckoned they were working in a lovely old building which has been allowed to slip. And when you are paying £205 for two for bed and breakfast, I'm afraid you can't get away with that without comments.  Our advice might be to wait until refurbishment is completed - and if not - avoid Room 2 unless you like a cold room with a bed that lurches like a trampolene each time your partner turns over.
0;" Booked to stay here for our daughters graduation. Have been to cambridge many times but have not stayed here before. Room was small (ok for 1 night) but was well equipped. No nice view from window though. Bathroom was small and there was no where to put toiletries. Had drinks on the Roof Top bar which is lovely but I think £38 for a bottle of sparkling wine is way too much. Had dinner in the Riverside Grill which I had eaten in before but this time it was awful. Service was poor and food overcooked. Had to go elsewhere to have a cheese board and coffee to fill us up! Breakfast was served in this same restaurant but luckily it was lovely; good choice well presented and nice staff. When we checked out it took 45 minutes for our car to be returned to us so goodness knows where it was parked! "
0; I recently went here for my hen do - a spa weekend. The reception staff were friendly and welcoming, as were the staff in the spa. Spa treatments were great and the girl carrying out my treatment was really lovely. My only criticism is that I do prefer not to be spoken to during treatments, but the girl was just being friendly and I did talk back so can't complain.  The bedroom we stayed in was great, modern clean and had comfortable beds. Tea & coffee facilities were great. The shower was a little weak - I prefer a more powerful shower, but that's me being really picky.  The food was really nice. we had lunch, dinner and breakfast. Lunch service was fine, it was served as a buffet and we were served drinks promptly.... However, this all changed when we went to dinner. We initially ordered wine for the table, enough for one glass each but we were never approached again during the meal by any member of staff asking if we were ok for drinks. There was butter and side plates suggesting we would be served bread but we were served none. The starters were lovely but unfortunately three of the main meals, including mine, were sent back to the kitchen because they were not up to standard. I had ordered lamb shank which was really chewy, and 2 other members of the party had ordered braised beef which had clearly not been braised because it was tough to cut and really chewy. We waited a further 20 minutes before our meals were finally replaced - the staff half cleared the rest of the parties empty plates while we were still waiting! The replacement meal (chicken) was really tasty, and the desserts were great but we were not approached again for drinks orders or otherwise! Prior to dinner, we had a separate area of the hotel for canapés and cocktails. We went back to this area to play games (hen do) and were very disappointed to see the canapé trays & leftovers had not even been cleared away!  The next morning at breakfast we were told tables could not be pushed together to accommodate our party which was fair enough until I saw staff push tables together for other guests!? You can't do for one guest what you won't do for another, surely?! We were not approached or offered tea or coffee, we had to find a member of staff and ask for it and eventually got it once we'd finished eating.   Overall, I had a good weekend but that was down to my sisters efforts. I really would think twice about coming back to this hotel based on the distinct lack of service in the restaurant!! 
0; The hotel is new and has all the facilities you would expect from a Hilton. The bar has live music on a Saturday and the staff were fantastic, it is also well priced for a hotel bar. All the staff are friendly and helpful. The location is great near all shops and the Albert dock. Rooms are a good size and decorated well. The downsides we arrived at 1.30pm there was a tray with half eaten in the corridor, this was still there after our shopping trip, when we went out and when we went to bed at 11pm, there was cleaning staff in the corridor cleaning the rooms and we ordered room service so there is no doubt that staff had seen it. Our shower had no power whatsoever, by the time the water was hitting us it was cold, we reported it to reception who said they would get someone to look at it, in the morning it was the same. The bed was a bit lumpy, especially to say it is a brand new hotel. Breakfast in bed was ok but no tea and coffee arrived with it, so we had to make our own! 
0; Stayed at the Dukes Head for 2 nights. We were researching our Grandparents past., they owned a tailors shop which is now underneath Sainsburys car park! Shame but that's progress. Lynn is full of history if that's what rocks your boat, the old part is well kept, unfortunately you have the rest I lost count of charity shops which seem to dominate all towns these days. While we were in Lynn they had 3 brilliant light shows projected onto the buildings.back to the Dukes Head it's a central hotel, staff were very polite,our bedroom 312 was clean, bright and modern looked onto a pub garden which could be noisy at the weekend. We did't eat at the hotel as we there were plenty of places in town. 
0;"Although I took a 40+ group for four nights, during our stay I never met a Manager or anyone who introduced themselves or asked if all was well.  The hotel is in a lovely location, but is let down by its lack of direction.  The breakfasts were good, but the dinner was not, presumably because we were a group. Despite paying for it, no coffee was made available after dinner, a particular disappointment I suspect for those who had paid a single supplement of £10 per night. They had no serving spoons in the dining room! 'Awaiting delivery!' Had to try to serve vegetables with two forks! Bar prices high. Serving staff friendly and helpful, but let down by their seniors and lack of management.  If you visit for a special occasion, bring a vase; as organiser I was given a bouquet of flowers, but they have no vases, so they sat sadly in a water jug for the duration of my stay!  Our room, several minutes walk from reception (suggested they offer scooters) was onto the car park with a large picture window, but no blinds or net curtain for privacy. I asked for this but it was not forthcoming, so when changing had to shut out the sunshine with the blackout curtains. The refrigerator space in the wardrobe was blocked off with a piece of unpainted wood. Not what I expect from a four star hotel."
0; We only stayed one night and I have to say the room was fantastic. Breakfast was also very tasty and great choice. However the customer service is poor. It is like 'here are your keys, crack on'. No explanation of breakfast, no taking you to the room and explaining where everything is eg the kettle is hidden in a drawer. No 'can we help you up the stairs as you have a buggy and a toddler'. The DVD player didn't work as it is had the wrong connection for the TV. There was no WIFI. It wouldn't matter if the room prices were not so high but they are very expensive. The prices should mean they get everything spot on, but they don't. It could be an amazing place to stay with a little more focus on customer needs. 
0;" Stayed in this hotel mid week last June having a couple of days off and visiting our son at Uni. Room was usual standard larger hotel style, could do with a little updating, but clean and comfortable. The leisure facilities are superb and we spend a relaxing afternoon in the pool & jacuzzi, as it was mid week we basically had the facility to ourselves. The hotel is geared to corporate events as we found out when going down for breakfast the first morning. It was about 9.15 and the hotel foyer was buzzing with 'suits' having tea/ coffee and biscuits prior to going into their meeting/ conference. We entered the large dining room where the staff were clearing the buffets tables even though breakfast was served until 9.30; and they looked horrified that we were just coming in!  We were ushered into a corner, no one explained that it was completely self service, the food that was left was not good. The following morning we decided to have breakfast in bed which was lovely and well cooked, on check out we complained about breakfast on the first morning and the receptionist who was lovely took off the service charge for the following morning. "
0;We stayed here on at Saturday night in room 106, The Directors Suite, NoT good. First impressions, reception not very welcoming, on entry to bedroom, carpet torn not what I would expect of this standard of hotel and room dated and worn !Room overlooked canal, big mistake as the noise outside was horrendous and went on all night, with fighting, screaming out side, so got no sleep at allBreakfast very average. I would not stay here again, very overrated !!!
0; Good location - walking distance to South Kensington Tube station. National History Museum just around the corner as well as the V&A and Science museum. Looks like an old Victorian house from the front - in a street with similar white fronted houses. Rooms are OK for sleep and washing and are therefore ideal for sightseeing. Rather pricey £310 for two nights for two people)- but all London hotels seem rather expensive - this one was probably priced more for the location than standard of accommodation. Could do with an upgrade of decor/ new bathroom fittings etc. Everything we wanted was functioning. Tea and coffee facilities in bedroom. Rather large air conditioning apparatus in bedroom with a tube to a hole in the window. Did not test this as it was October and not very warm. We would stay again if the price was right as the location was ideal for what we wanted. 
0; I stayed in the Radisson Blu as our annual Christmas Party was taking place there and I was bitterly disappointed.   The room was outdated and looked cheap. The shower head didn't stay in place so I had to physically hold it over my head to have a shower (obviously this is not the easiest of tasks) and there was a strange noise coming from the bathroom that continued throughout my stay. The bed drooped in the middle and was quite uncomfortable.   The food was mediocre at best and the service was worse. One server actually spilled some of my colleagues dinner over her and didn't even seem to realise or apologise.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend. You'd be better off in a Premier Inn. 
0; On arrival, the staff were very friendly.We were very pleased with our room when we first entered, it was very big and well designed, but on closer inspection, for the price we paid, it was quite disappointing, the grout in shower was dirty, there were some stains on the carpets, and the bedroom door handle was not even screwed together!I did tell the lady on reception our faults with the room, and she did make a note of them.The views over Birmingham were very good, and the breakfast was lovely. It was very convienient for our visit to the hippodrome. so all in all some good points and some bad. We wouldn't stay there again, we have stayed in other hotels in the area, which have been a better quality for the money. 
0;" A group of my friends had purchased me the spa stay for 2 as a birthday present and my friend of mine (a couple) decided to book on as well as a treat. We were very dubious after reading reviews online after we had booked but decided to take on some of the tips other Trip Advisor's had made previously and they did help. We arrived at 12pm, after the rush and were checked in immediately, the hotel receptionists were incredibly polite and mention 1 of our rooms was ready early and they were next door to each other should we wish to pop in and drop things off, which was lovely and made the start of the &quot;journey&quot; all that more lovely. Our room was spacious and fairly modern, yes there was the odd stain on the carpet and the windows don't open more than 6 inches but if you managed to find the fan (in the Cupboard like I did at 3am) and ignore the stains these aren't dramas. We went to check into the spa itself and that was a fairly long and drawn out process and from the spa reception we could see the spa was absolutely heaving and were mildly relieved to be asked to use the leisure facilities changing room as these were quieter and looked pretty clean. No robes were immediately available but they offered to bring them through to us in the changing rooms which again was fine. The spa was chock full of people every room was busy and we queued for the steam rooms and saunas, I can however imagine on a weekday its fairly quiet and lovely. We decided to pop to Silverstone's (the bar I think) to order some food and drinks seeing as it was so busy in the spa, we stood for 15 minutes waiting for a drink and asked to set up a tab to save us carrying bits of paper around all day this seemed fairly impossible so we paid upfront for our food and drink. The food order came out wrong..... twice- both things that weren't initially ordered at the bar but at this point we had finished our lunch and my friend whose order came out wrong was too fed up to wait any longer ended up eating the wrong sandwich (at £8 a sandwich) it shouldn't have gone so wrong there was no talk of a refund or discount for such a calamity. Went back to the spa me and my friend had treatments and to the credit of the therapists they turned our mood around and it was truly relaxing. Dinner was a bit of a nightmare, not a lot of the wait staff speak English so ordering a bottle of Merlot was painful, ordering a coffee after dinner took 3 different waiters before finally getting to COFFEE. I must note we did manage to set up the tab with reception and this was noted to our waiter at dinner several times when we charged drinks to our room, the embarrassment of being chased through the restaurant to &quot;pay your bill!&quot; was something I won't forget in a hurry! By this point we had given up and gone for after dinner drinks in the bar where we noticed another young couple complaining to management about similar issues we had had.  I have had several friends go to Whittlebury Hall and rave about it but sadly a lot of our stay was below par and I'm not sure I would recommend. "
0;" Pros: *iMac in room *fitness room (though very small) *location- right by Temple Meads *comfortable bedding *curtains block out all street lighting  Cons: *disappointing breakfast- scrambled eggs very sloppy; everything kept running out and had to wait 10mins for more to be brought out on two occasions; when breakfast is busy, waiters are very slow to serve tea/coffee *mini bar in room not stocked- you have to go downstairs to the lobby to buy food/drinks *shower temperature was occasionally burning hot even turned down to lowest heat setting and sometimes fluctuated from hot to cold *air con did not work in one room I stayed in *iMac in one room I stayed in was slow and kept crashing   Booked the hotel when it was still the Mint, and we were not informed it had changed to the Hilton Garden Inn prior to our arrival. I much preferred this hotel as the Mint (stayed there May 2011)- there was a better breakfast selection and mini bars in the rooms were stocked with good quality snacks (like Green & Blacks chocolate). "
0;"I stayed here at the end of July with around 13 other woman for my friends hen do. On first impressions the hotel is clean and very presentable. The staff at the front desk were friendly and got us checked in quickly, a favourable start. I shared a room with my cousin-in-law and were told we would be given a room with two single beds, however when we got to our room we had 1 double bed and the room was really rather small and felt cramped. However it was tidy and clean and we laughed off the situation of having to share a bed. The room was very hot so we put the air conditioning on the coldest setting but this appeared to do nothing so thought if we leave it on all night whilst we are out, when we come back to the room it should be nice and cool. This was not the case, the room was just as hot if not hotter! To makes things worse when we finally got to sleep the fire alarm in the building went off at around 2 in the morning, at first we though this was probably a fault as when we had arrived at the hotel to check in, they appeared to be testing the fire alarms. However it did not turn off and everyone had to file out of the building (all in our pyjamas/dressing gowns!) to stand on the street in front of the hotel getting jeered by passers by. There was not 1 member of staff helping us find our way at the fire exits and where not informed of where the meeting points were in the case of a fire. Luckily there was not a fire and it was just some drunken idiot on the 4 floor deciding to smash the fire alarm and set it off! Next morning when we went down to meet our party, most of the women we were with including the Hen herself had said their rooms were all hot and the air conditioning was not working. Some of the girls had fans put in (I think the hotel should do this anyway to be honest if they know the rooms have faults with the A.C) so we also asked at front desk if one could be put in our room to avoid another disturbed nights sleep. The staff again were friendly and helpful and this was done no problem and was there when we got back, although the room was so hot and close that it did not help immensely. The worst fault about this hotel was the room key situation. Some of our party were given room keys later as they arrived after everyone else, only to find when they got to the room some other woman from our party were already in it! This is absolutely outrageous to give people the wrong room keys, especially when someone is already in that room! The girls that arrived later were highly embarrassed as they did not know the other girls from the party yet...I suppose it's one interesting way to introduce yourself! We were given reduced parking at the hotel when we booked, but at £12 a night this was still a silly price to have to pay on top of your room charge. However this fee was waived when the Hen made a complaint about all that had been wrong. When we checked out though the man we spoke to at the front desk did not seem to believe us and questioned us when we said we were from the &quot;*Hen's name* Party&quot; when we where told to state this when checking out and that our parking fee had been waived. He made us feel as though we were lying then went off to check with his manager, who promptly told him that we were right. He gave us our ticket to leave the car park but seemed to do so unwillingly. A shame when all the other staff in the hotel had been helpful and friendly. All in all it was an ok hotel, most of the staff were great but I would not say it was a 4* hotel. Would I stay here again? Possibly not."
0; I visited the Hotel last weekend This was with a Groupon deal. Despite paying extra for an Executive sleep and asking several times before the arrival for a nice suite the room was average. Definitely not a 4 star room. I've stayed in nicer places for a lot less money. Upon arrival we were given no information on anything. With the executive suite we were supposed to get a number of extra things, but it took several calls and questions from the room to actually get what we had paid for.  As we went down to our room, Room 101, we immediately saw that we were the room right next to some building work. I went back to Reception to ask if the building work would take place on the Saturday morning, to which I was told no, or if they did come in they would not start until 11am. 7:30am I was woken by banging. Really not what I needed. The food was lovely and the restaurant staff were fantastic. Really good value for money.  The swimming pool isn't really a pool. So, if you're looking to do a few lengths, then I'm afraid that isn't going to be possible.  The room was very clean and the bathroom was lovely.  Overall an average stay, but unfortunately not worth the money I paid for. 
0; Arriving at the hotel at 2pm, an hr before check-in, I didn't expect to b able to check-in to our room but it's always worth asking, what I didn't expect was our reservation not to be in the system at all. Having booked it through countryhotels.com on Thursday and pre-paying it I was asked by reception to forward through our confirmation, while waiting for it I was told that the reservations team don't work weekends which may have been why it hadn't been put in the system, having been a Reservations Manager myself in a hotel, even I know Friday was a working day for me and if I was off it was picked up by the reception team. We ended up going into Durham for lunch while it was being sorted. On return, check-in went smoothly and the room was lovely, very clean, a Jacuzzi bath, there was a wedding on and you wouldn't have known, very happy! Our night away included a 3 course meal which mine was lovely apart from the chilli crap cake starters, they were like balls of Princes Pate in bread crumbs, I did complain and was offered a different starter but didn't fancy anything else, I felt we could have had our onion rings or peppercorn sauce which were extras taken off the bill, my partners chicken was very dry and if we hadn't ordered the sauce it would have been difficult to eat, dessert was amazing just a lot of it. This morning at breakfast our reservation said we had to pay for it yet it was supposed to be included, the waitress was fine about that and just sat us down. When we received the bill at check out our meals had been added to the bill, the receptionist took them off at our request and said that things had been missed as the reservation was put in quickly....Overall it was a lovely night away and the staff are very friendly and attentive, there's just a few things that needed ironing out on this occasion, I would def return and experience Redworth again 
0;" Stayed for a bit of family Girly time me my Mum & Daughter. The Hotel itself was clean and tidy. Staff were friendly. But seemed difficult to use the &quot;facilities&quot; A separate key card needed for each area (pool & gym). Even though I told them I wanted to use these areas. The pool is ridiculously small and disappointing. The steam room wasn't on the first day. Apparently you need to ask the staff to turn it on!. I requested this. But it was only marginally warm and no lighting. Then switches off on a timer so absolutely no point to it. No hot water in room first evening. Must have been fixed overnight as it was hot at 7am. Disappointing when I couldn't bathe. Breakfast was good but not fantastic with minimum supplies (almost like it was the end of serving time) I won't stay here again. Probably fine if you wanted to stay overnight without great expectation. "
0; I would say that this Hilton is by far the most stylish Hilton I have ever seen!!! It does look phenomenal and I would say its more a boutique style hotel.  I initially went there for Breakfast with a business partner and was disgusted by their slow service: On several tables,there were still the plates from guest eating before their and our table wasnt served or looked after while being there for 1,5 hours.  Worser than this was that I had to find little pieces of the shells in the eggs plus one of the tomatoes was unsound. 
0; Welcome was polite and very chirpy, rooms are adequate. Some rooms have had a semi-refurb others are very dated. I was travelling with some colleagues and all our rooms seemed to be very different. Everyone complained about the pillows and how thin they were. The bar area is dull. No atmosphere, no background music, resembled a library rather than a bar. Colleagues ate in the restaurant on one evening and said that was the same, they were the only people eating in there. Bar ran out of wine (!).... Overall just quite a dull and drab place to stay. We ate out locally at the White Heart in Hartlebury, a mile or so up the road, food was fab and noticed other hotel guests were eating there too! 
0;" Just returned after a 4 day stay. We have stayed here before but despite that and having read the recent reviews were somewhat disappointed ... because we booked a superior room, but the upgrade was only noticeable in so far as we received complimentary slippers, bathrobes, toiletries. Sadly, the room had maintenance problems - loose sockets, a reading light that sometimes worked, flickerlingly at low light, sometimes not, draughty windows, curtains which were not fully attached to the rail, and stained carpets (wouldn't want to go barefoot); the bed linen was clearly freshly laundered but had brown stains at chin level - gross! It was frequently cold in the room, and the bedding was just a simple blanket, not a cosy duvet, rather inadequate. My husband used the bathrobe as additional cover. The mattress was comfortable. The room was otherwise well equipped, with a safe, ironing board, small table and two chairs plus desk and chair. The bathroom was ok but lacked any facility for hanging used towels. It also had no shaving / cosmetic (magnifying) mirror. The water pressure was very strong and plenty of hot water. The shower was over the bath. The views are fantastic, especially from the top floor restaurant where breakfast is served. The staff there were friendly and efficient. Food was fine. The fact that we were cold a lot of the time and the stains on the carpet and linen means we won't be returning but realise we probably have to pay more elsewhere (this cost under £600 for 4 nights including breakfast). "
0; Sophie on reception was very nice and helpful, the first room we got even though nice and had a sea view, was just too hot, we then got a room at the back which had a sitting room as well, that was cooler, there was no socket near the kettle so had to move it next to the tv, which was not very safe, again no sockets near the mirrors, the reception area was very small, no lounge for guests to relax in, decor very plain and the towels and dressing gowns were very rough, the cleaning staff were nice and friendly and work very hard. Breakfast was not worth the money, the restaurant manager was not at all friendly and the waiting staff looked miserable, you are better off having breakfast out, I would expect a lot more of a 4* so not sure how they got that, I have been in much better 3* we got a deal for the 2 nights we stayed, if we had paid full price we would have been very disappointed. 
0; just back from 2 nite break.had to upgrade as 1st room.small,extremely dark and nearly in carpark.hotel was nice.staff could really do with supervision and training.attitudes unpleasant at times.barman in dolly bar asking his colleague in loud voice why she had sat on her backside(but used a swear word) all afternoon.the girl Char was an absolute star with everything.put her at front of house and comments like these and others would disappear.i have never written a comment on trip advisor before. 
0; We booked the Ramada when it was offering rooms at half price - so paid £70ish for a one night stay. We thought it was an excellent deal, especially being in London. The hotel is in Zone 3 of the Tube System and was located an easy 5/10 minute walk from the station.  We arrived at 11pm and first impressions weren't great. We thought that the hotel would have looked a lot better from the outside, but the décor in the reception/foyer improved our view a little. We got the the Check-in Desk to find 2 members of staff busy, not actually acknowledging that they had customers to check in. After a further 5minutes we were seen and checked in to our room.  On arrival to the room, we found a number of negative things. I can say that the décor was nice and homely rather than the bog standard plain white rooms that you can get in other hotels. unfortunately I could see numerous damp patches on the walls, mainly around the edges of the wall paper, as well as on the ceiling. There was a huge crack on the ceiling that had been covered over with a different colour paint so it stood out against the white. The bathroom was clean, with fresh towels, but the toilet seat was broken and could slide off to one side quite easily.  At half 11, we ordered room service - simple ice cream. When ordering, my Boyfriend was asked which flavours he would like, but was were only offered strawberry. it took half an hour for it to arrive - with a combination of three flavours instead! it was also a cash payment which we were not informed about until it arrived.  Also, no wi-fi in rooms! and the TV didn't work very well. Wouldn't pay the full price for the room, and would prefer to stay at a locally owned hotel instead next time. 
0;Enjoyed an amazing deal from Wowcher and took friend away for her birthday for £40 each! Enjoyed a free glass of prosecco, a reasonably sized room and a very nice breakfast. We used spa which was ok as free robe and slippers offered. There's wasn't anyone there to get robes from so we had to enquire at main reception. There was so much chlorine that our eyes were stinging and other spa users said the same. Despite the bargain price and nice hotel interior, our room was cold and we made about 3 calls to reception as nothing was being done. Felt rather 'fobbed off' with excuses (saying radiator just needed adjusting but we explained that it was an ancient radiator with no knob to turn). Both modern towel rail in bathroom (hence cold, soggy towels all of the stay) and old bedroom radiator were clearly not working. No one came to service it when we asked and eventually we were offered a heater. There was only 1 shower gel and shampoo for us both, half a toilet roll (and no spare one!) and very little milk. Decor was tired and not very well maintained. It was quiet in the room however. When we booked initially, we were booked into a hotel in Gloucester when we definitely asked for Bournemouth. We only discovered this error on calling to confirm booking 2 days before. Could have been a disaster if no rooms had been free. Receptionist did not speak English as a first language and clearly struggled to understand. We were put in double room when we wanted twin! Oh dear.
0; This hotel is in a fantastic location overlooking the seafront and a short walk from both the train station and the centre for shopping. With a grand exterior, the lobby, bar and breakfast room are really impressive and nearly rival the much more expensive 'The Grand' hotel next door. However that's where the similaraties end, the rooms leave a lot to be desired for the price you pay. Size seems to vary greatly we booked 2 rooms and one was quite generous whilst the other was tiny. The amenities within the room are also basic. Style and attention to detail seems to have been exclusively spent on the public areas of the hotel. The service at the hotel was pleasant throughout our stay and the pool and sauna were clean and tidy. Both the hotel was on a good deal I would book again but its not worth its going rate. 
0; it's more of a 3 star rather than a 4 star. it looks very much like premier inn with fancier curtains and cushions. the staff were all lovely and efficient and the hotel is located next to the train station which is ideal if you are travelling.  their bathrooms are in real need of a refurb if they want to see themselves as a 4 star hotel. the breakfast was ok. it's ok for an overnight stay but do not expect a 4 star or you might get disappointed. 
0; This is the first and last time we booked the Park Plaza. The hotel looks modern when you arrive, and the staff is superb. We have been upgraded to a studio room on the 7th floor. So far so good.  First strange thing is that the bedroom is straight after you open the door to your room. The bed is pretty much half a meter far from the door. Then you have a small kitchen with a micro wave and a kettle when you walk into the sitting room. Strange layout, we thought. The bed is quite small and not very comfortable. About 7 am, the hell starts. You can literary hear everything happening in the rooms next door. Someone using a hair dryer. People talking. Kids running around like crazy in the room above us. People walking pass the door. I asked at the reception how long ago this hotel was built. I was told it was 5 years ago.  The designer deserves to be shot! 
0;" This is a place of extremes, so let's start with the good... The view. It's superb, and as we were in the honeymoon suite it's probably the best in the hotel. The receptionist Julita. She was lovely! The bathroom. Spotless and spacious. Er...is that really all that is good about this place? For £230 a night you'd hope not. But...the room service breakfast was horrible. Lukewarm very average fry up, that old fashioned powdered orange juice that I though didn't exist anymore and stewed tea served from limescaly stained teapots. The hotel itself needs a good update - the chair arms are all worn and the stair carpets are frayed. The wedding planner woman - she ignored emails when she realised we weren't going to use their 'special room rates' for our guests (rates that actually work out more expensive than booking direct, that's how special they are!) The night staff - who'd have thought you could be invisible to so many of them, and we only asked for a box of matches. Which we never got by the way. Despite all this we had a fabulous weekend but this hotel deserves a 3* rating, being generous; it trades on its location but I've stayed in better Premier Inns for a quarter of the price. "
0; Took my daughter for a short break, having stayed previously & loved it. Although we had booked a discount last minute deal, I didn't expect to be in such a small room - felt more appropriate to be a single. Perhaps we were upgraded last time & hadn't realised? In any case the room is not representative of the pictures online. Reception staff seemed a little disinterested, but the concierge team were fantastic. 
0;I stayed here in Dec'11. A bit late in the day to write its review.  The reason I am writing this review because I fell very very sick when I stayed here. I have no proof but I feel that something was not ok with the food i ate here especially the breakfast buffet.   The room was average with a nice view of the airport.  The bed was ok.  The bathroom was ok.  Hot water available.  The bar was nice with motivated staff.  The front desk was helpful in arranging me a private taxi for a business trip out of the city . I was unfamiliar with the rates but they advised me which was helpful to get a good rate.  Glitches :-  1. The lack of proper signs to reach the room. The property is quiet big.  2. Nothing is close by at walking distance. If you want to go anywhere, you must have a car else you have to rely on hotel's food.  3. The heating took quiet a long time to fire. i was coming from southern hemisphere ( summers) and as soon as I reached here, I wanted the heat but it was almost like 2 hours before the heating in my room got fixed. I will not call this a 4 star hotel!  4. Finally - The typhoid. I reached the hotel in A 1 health for a 7 day stay. By end of 5th day, I was very sick. I was only eating the hotel food as I did not have a car. I just went out once in 7 days for a business meeting and never ate anything out. For last 2 days in the hotel, I was literally sleeping 24/7..I was so sick. With great difficulty, I packed my bags, checked out, boarded the international flight and reached back home. Once home, doctor told me I had typhoid which could be result of dirty food.  Though, I can not say for 100% sure, it was a result of staying here. But this is how it exactly happened.  Overall, for the price and location, i think their could be better options in London. Will not repeat this hotel.
0; Chaotic check-in with coach trips. Hotel extremely busy, noisy and chaotic, which is probably due to it's size. Lifts take an eternity to arrive, which again is probably down to size of hotel. Room very basic. Unable to open window even though room was very hot. Needed maintenance to come and unlock it. Shower jammed and would not turn on. TV would not stay on. Unable to receive any channels. Not just our room but all of our party. Plus points - Breakfast was very nice and location of hotel was very central. 
0; Booked through Hilton's own website and made a request on the booking, which was ignored. Had a suite which had amenities like a coffee machine and mini fridge, however none work plugged in. Because of location of the plug sockets, had to rearrange the furniture in the room to find the nearest available one (plus one wasn't working at all). The A/C unit was loud and I don't think did anything at all. Brought a special champagne from home and requested a bucket and ice with two glasses. This took 3 requests and over an hour to arrive. Upon check out, we were told we still had to pay for breakfast and two drinks we had in the bar. These were paid for there and then, however the reception staff didn't believe us. It took us opening our bank statements on our phones to prove we had already paid. This left a really sour taste in our mouths, feeling like we were almost accused of lying, after what was an otherwise pleasant trip away. 
0;Dated but refurbed, over priced especially drinks! Good location for Harry Potter, pool was closed on arrival, receptionist didnt care! Sure it was a one off, leisure facilities good, restaurant food was also good, rooms ok, beds comfy and large, ok but wouldnt go back.
0; We came to the hotel to attend a family Ruby wedding party, as we had a long journey we booked a room for the night. At reception we found the check in easy and the staff friendly. We had a good time at the party and the buffet was very good with plenty of variety, lovely desserts. Our room was clean with plenty of towels, but no face cloths and as we had forgotten ours it would have been nice if they had been provided. The breakfast was realy good with plenty of choice. Overall a nice weekend break. 
0; We stayed here recently for a friends wedding. I had high expectations as it looks beautiful online and I've passed it many times in the car so was looking forward to it. It was a bit disappointing in the end though. Our room was miles from reception so after driving for hours from London we had to get back in the car and drive around the hotel to our room. Our room was a bit pokey, it had 2 singles pushed together, the showerhead wouldn't stay upright and the hair dryer was one of those useless fixed ones that cut out when it gets hot. Overall not what I expected from a 4 star 'luxury' hotel. Felt like 3 star at 5 star prices. 
0; Public areas were warm and welcoming as were the reception staff. Room on 4th floor was a good size and had a great river view. However, duvet was thin and seemed too small for the bed. None of the four pillows were quite right singularly or in combination. Bed linen overall disappointing and not conducive to a good night. Some noise from nearby railway bridge didn't help. Bathroom reasonably spacious but tired. Was not possible to get shower beyond lukewarm and. Small largely immovable shower head made it difficult to get underneath it. Disappointing. Breakfast best described as adequate although dining room overlooking the water was bright and cheerful on a cold gloomy morning. 
0; Stayed here for my birthday with a friend. Check in was easy and had no problems. We had 2 queen beds and a room with a view. It was lovely inside very clean, great big comfy bed. We were on the 2nd floor with the restaurants underneath us. On our first night unfortunately we were advised to go to a club that was shut down? Then when we returned from our night out just after 3am we were threatened by the man on reception because apparently we were screaming and jumping around which was an absolute lie!!!! We do look young but we're actually grown women with manners and respect. When my friend went down to reception to speak to the man he became very upset and angry. It wasn't a nice end to the night at all. On Saturday we thought we would check out the spa area. There is 1 small sauna and a shower area next door... they have 4 massage chairs which is like a waiting area. Very uncomfortable when other couples come in. It's a beauty salon that they've stretched to offer spa treatments. My stay wasn't amazing it was just ok 
0; The executive rooms were nice and lived up to 4* rating.  However the pool was cold and the whole pool area & changing rooms were disgusting. The hot tub had far too much chemical in and stung our eyes. The water was cloudy so hate to imagine the cleanliness of the water. We didn't use the facility's again even though we had two further opportunities. Breakfast was standard. We had one evening meal that was prebooked. We waited ages to order food & drink then waited an hour for the food. At no time did anyone apologies for slowness or check if we needed more drinks or if everything was OK .   
0; This hotel is in a great place to get around the town. There is a free car park too although you will need directions as not easy to find. The staff were very friendly and helpful and made our stay. There were , however, a few negatives hence the lower score. The rooms are a good size and individually decorated. Our room Gill was clean but really needs a new carpet and the bathroom door painted. The room only had a shower so if you want a bath you will need to state this as part of the booking. There were toiletries from Elemis but this were not replenished so no shower gel left for last shower after a 3 day stay. There was a tray with crisps, coffee/tea, biscuits and water - again not all replenished daily. Fresh milk was delivered but could equally be made available in the mini bar fridge. The breakfast was good but again it needed topping up especially if you ate later. Shame as could be a great boutique and luxury hotel. I had a spa treatment and this was great and good value. The room was draughty by the window but there is heating you can set. Free wifi with no issues/unavailability. 
0; The hotel bar/ restaurant is what you would expect from the website. The room however was not, it smelled off, the bathroom floor tiles needed resealing, sofa was worn at the edges and was generally out of keeping with the trendy downstairs area. 
0; Nice hotel, friendly helpful staff on reception. Hotel bar a little pricey. Rooms a little on the small side but have everything you could need for a short stay, bed was comfy. Excellent swimming pool and spa facilities, used these the day after our night out. Would stay again. 
0; We recently stayed at Slaley Hall having booked the half price Winter deal. Here's my review:  Positives - The communal areas (corridors, informal seating areas, reception etc.) are gorgeous. Very decadent and give you high hopes for the rest of the hotel. - All of the staff that we came in to contact with were unfailingly polite and helpful. - The grounds are wonderful with some great walks. - The room was meticulously clean.  Negatives - The decor in the communal areas does not follow in to the bedrooms. I understand that the hotel is being renovated and only 20 of the rooms have been decorated so far. As it was the hotel room was tired and the decor (and TV!) outdated. - The pool area (inc. steam room & sauna) was just ok. I expected it to be sumptuous and inviting, but it wasn't. The steam room and sauna were tiny and the jacuzzi didn't work on one of the days we were there. Similar facilities at my gym are much much better. - The changing rooms for the pool / gym are in need of an upgrade. The wooden veneer was peeling, there were only 2 hairdryers and only 2 of the 4 showers were working. The shower cubicles were disgusting, the grout in the tiles covered in black mould.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this hotel. I expected a little bit of luxury but it was average. If I had paid full price for my stay I would have been very very unhappy. 
0;Yes when you arrive it all looks grand , this is my 5th and last visit here, online checkin claims to reduce checkin in reality that's not true still queueing for 20 minutes , usually stay in a remix but paid extra on a breakfast rate for an executive room, it was small, sparce and I personal , no dressing gowns they didn't even put spoons in to make tea , I asked for this to be sorted along with the mini bar being emptied but no nothing .. Drinks in the bar are not too bad but they slip a 10% service charge on without saying , it's apparently written in Tiney writing on the menu , breakfast was terrible , organised chaos , cold food, queues sorry to say won't be coming back 
0; Very disappointed ,the evening was in three sections of the hotel ,would have been better allin the same area,splitting it sometimes made it look like there wasn't enough people to fill it,lack of bar staff taking ages to get a drink, the food was the worst we have had,it was a buffet but they had done roast or fish sit down meal which was help yourself ,it was cold there wasn't enough,some people didn't get any except desert ,if they were doing a buffet they should of just kept to finger food instead of trying to do a 3 course help yourself dinner it just didn't work.. Will go elsewhere next year... 
0; We stayed over this weekend as we were attending a charity event. We had booked one of the rooms in the Executive suite, all of which have had a refurb.  It was a real mixture, staff were really friendly. The room itself was really large and had a lovely aspect (overlooking the gardens at the back). Really nice large bathroom with separate shower and bath and all very clean. But it really did feel like a wasted opportunity to Wow any occupants. Firstly the whole room could only be described as shades of beige. A bit of colour would have made such a large room feel really sumptuous . Also the furniture used didn't make best use of the ample space. The tea making facilities were tucked in a really awkward little cupboard under the TV, tricky to get it in and out and then nowhere other than the dressing table (which was already full of stuff) to put the kettle, dirty teaspoons etc on. If this had been a small room I would have understood it but we could have hosted Strictly in it to be honest!   Lighting was really dim, great use of energy saving bulbs which we applaud. However there wasn't a single place for a girl to do her make up in a proper light. The bathroom was a tad better but still no separate light over the mirror and the magnifying mirror needed tightening as it was hanging down.  Everything was really clean but I would suggest that the towels have probably had their day. They were a bit thin and again missed the opportunity for it to feel special. All the shampoos etc were good though and having bathrobes and slippers was nice.  The event we attended was really good, food was good and the service was great. The staff worked really hard and we certainly acknowledge that.   One area that could do with improving is the bar. It was completely uninspiring in terms of the drinks on offer. It looked half empty and as usual in these places no interesting beers or lagers, just the usual mass produced stuff. There was a real lack of choice in terms of spirits and those of us that had a spirit based drink said that it tasted like the cheapest version that could be found but at hotel prices.  So we had a good evening with friends for a worthy cause, staff were lovely but I think the hotel does need a face lift and in the rooms that have been done already, please have a look and give them a bit of life! 
0; This is a Pretty Hotel set in 22 acres of Land and has a impressive driveway on arrival. I stayed for Valentines Day 1 night with my Partner. Staff at reception were lovely even upgraded us as i think they were'nt really full that night. Room was average, Not horrible by any means but not amazing either. My only issues were with the mattress that seemed to dip in the middle and equates to me and my partner rolling into the middle through the night. Also room was way to hot even though no heating was on so in which came for a uncomfortable nights sleep. Went down to the spa and pool area, which is again just okay nothing amazingly special, only the jacuzzi wasnt working and thats what me and my partner where especially looking forward too. They had a special offer for breakfast £ 10 pp which i suppose is not too bad considering Windsor's proximity.   Glad we got a special offer on Lastminute.com as i would of been quite unhappy to pay the price that was quoted on their website for the same night though. Fire alarm also caused an issue on the monday morning and would not turn off. We had to be evacuated which was a bit of a bummer in the cold but not the hotels fault so didnt affect our stay.. 
0; I booked a short break of 3 nights (Fri to Mon) at the Star Castle, travelling with my husband and 90 year old mother-in-law. My husband and I know the Scillies very well and were keen to take my mum-in-law, who has a lifelong interest in island life and has been a regular visitor to most of the UK islands, particularly around Scotland. The shuttle from the airport to the hotel was great, a smooth start to our break. On arrival, our garden room was very comfortable with spectacular views of the coast, off-islands and sea. Mum's garden room was adequate, a little dark, but more importantly there were no grab rails for shower or bath.  Staff on the whole were a delight, mostly friendly and helpful. The journey from the hotel to the room/restaurant was a challenge for mum, there was insufficient lighting with many steps to negotiate. Food overall was very good with the exception of the last night. We opted for roast 'sunday supper', the beef was tough, yorkshire puddings poor and and the brownie we had for pudding would not yield to a spoon or fork, although some bravely dug in!   On booking, we knew hotel was at top of hill and were happy to pay for transport. Mum's walking distance is limited and to this end, we rented a buggy for the day to show her St. Mary's, this was a great success. Being a lifelong gardener, mum was very keen to see Tresco, so I asked at reception about renting a buggy on Tresco for the Saturday, apparently all were booked. So, I arranged a buggy for the Sunday instead, all well and good. On Sunday morning, I rang reception to ask whether the buggy could be brought to the boat drop-off point, as mum could not walk very far, only to be told that we did not have a booking after all. Have to say we were all devastated by this.  I contacted the Tresco Island office, who were dismissive of our plight and stated that we were on a waiting list should a buggy become free, the receptionist at the Star Castle did not tell me we were on a waiting list when I booked.  I have never been moved to write a hotel review before, but in this case I feel certain shortfalls should be highlighted, particularly in regard to guests of an older demographic with limited mobility. This demographic are a steady income stream for the islands, particularly out of season, therefore perhaps a little more thought should be put into how to optimise experience and enjoyment. Lighting, grab rails and small adjustments to accommodation would go a long way. A timed shuttle service to/from the town/quay would be most appreciated by those guests with reduced mobility.  The most disappointing aspect was not being able to take mum to Tresco. No apology or alternative was offered either by the hotel or the Tresco Office. Perhaps the fault partly lay with myself for not having anything in writing re: the buggy booking (thought this would not be necessary)? The miscommunication between Star Castle and Tresco Island Office resulted in mum not being able to visit and enjoy the Tresco gardens, very sad. 
0; Just got back from a weekend at Bognor with a group of friends for my 50th birthday.... we had a fantastic time .... but I must say I was so disappointed with the food .... buffet breakfast in our hotel (ocean) was just not hot enough.... buffet at Papa John's was not hot enough...food at Turners was just awful full stop. I felt unwell most of the break so spent most of the weekend drinking water... don't get me wrong I did have a drink now and again but not what I expected for a milestone birthday.... music and bands were absolutely brilliant so we still had a good weekend over all ..... 
0; I travel to London a huge amount on business and less frequently leisure and find London hotels all much of a muchness within this 4 star price bracket. You have to start from the mind set that you will get far less for your money than elsewhere in the UK including in comparison to the same hotel chains.  So what about the copthorne Tara? we stayed as we were going to Wimbledon. It was a great location for that. And also great location to visit the natural history, science or v&a museums.   The double room was larger than very Central London hotels and the staff were pleasant. Rooms were cleaned well and air conditioning was powerful.  On the minus side, the decor was faded. And I had to move furniture to find the 1 double socket that existed in the whole room.  Our room rate didn't include breakfast so I can't comment.  So in relation to other London hotels in this price bracket, it's fine. You're unlikely to rave about it, but I would find it difficult to complain about it. Have realistic expectations and you won't be disappointed.  
0; The hotel room was ok as you would expect with everything you would need, We were not happen that on two nights when we returned to our room we had to go to reception as neight er of our key cards would work. The food was ok buffet syle breakfast, and a epensive dinner on the two nights we ate. 
0;" We arrived late evening, needing to find a petrol station and the night porter, although pleasant enough, seemed to have limited local knowledge and we had none - a simple map or written information sheet at reception or in the room would have been useful. Reception did not seem to be aware we paid in full online at time of booking, but took our word when we said we had, still it was a little awkward. The room was on the top, 3rd floor and as there is no lift and parking was quite a bit away we were exhausted by the time we had our luggage inside. The hotel does not have its own off road parking and there is a charge at the recommended Cathedral car park. Happily the beds, of which we had our choice - two king size - were comfortable and the bedding excellent, although you do need to like a high pillow. To our surprise we found a kitchen between the bedroom and shower room. We used only the good tea/coffee making facility and family sized fridge but we had the washing machine, freezer, hob, oven and kitchen sink! Is a kitchen allowed to adjoin a toilet? Must be……… All was clean and perfectly adequate. The enormous bedroom with period fire surround, family dining table and chairs, 3 setter leather couch, coffee table, TV, digital alarm clock, luxurious carpeting – which at first glance looked dirty due to unfortunate design – and all the more usual furniture; was way too warm when we arrived, but we could not get any of the windows to open. The heating did go off and the room temperature was fine during the night.  The noise from the street right outside the windows was not fine. The single glazed windows let in every decibel and since the hotel is in the student district near pubs and clubs, chucking out time was particularly bad. Traffic noise continued all night. On the plus side there was no noise from plumbing or other guests. The only breakfast option of cereal, fresh milk, yogurt, fruit juice and fresh fruit, accompanied by cold croissant with butter and jam is served in your room and was very acceptable, but a pot of fresh black coffee, or tea, would have made it great. It was served spot on 08.15, as requested. If you are able bodied the top floor of Roscoe House is an experience and a little expenditure on double, or preferably triple, glazing would make it an exceptional one. "
0;" Having not had a &quot;holiday&quot; this year, we decided to go away for a few days and, as we both loved Liverpool, it seemed the right choice. We booked the hotel through lastminute.com as a &quot;Top Secret Hotel&quot; so only saw the hotel once it had been paid for - a risky move but, in the past, it's worked well. We arrived on the Friday evening and checked in. The hotel seemed grand but quaint as we went upstairs (no lift - but that's to be expected in a Georgian Hotel!) to our room. However, as we opened the door to our room, there was something stopping it from opening fully. That something was the bed. Think of a kissing gate...that's how we had to get in and out of the room - not great when trying to manoeuvre suitcases in and out! Once we finally managed to squeeze our way in, we explored the room. It was very strange. We entered through the bedroom. Then went through to a small area with a wardrobe and chest of drawers on which were drinks facilities. Off from this was the shower room and also a small living area with two comfy chairs, the tv & dvd player, a desk and shoe cupboard.  The shower couldn't decide whether it wanted to be hot or cold and fluctuated between the two. The tray filled up pretty quick too, and once the door opened, the water flooded out leaving the floor covered in water.  As there is no bar at the hotel, they encourage you to bring your own drinks - brilliant idea as it helps to keep costs down! However, on the final day when I went to make myself a drink, I turned the mug over to find the remnants of someone else's hot chocolate/coffee - not nice! As for sleep? The location lulls you into a false sense of security as it looks nice and quiet on arrival. However, as the windows aren't double glazed, the sound from the street travels straight through into the room - not great when it comes to &quot;tipping out&quot; time from the local pubs/clubs. Goodness knows how the people in the ground floor rooms coped! The fellow guests didn't help matters either as one couple in the room next to us arrived back at 2:30am, had an argument, she kicked the guy out of the room and then proceeded to blast her music out. Brilliant! This music was on a loop with only two songs playing and was played at various stages throughout the day and night - argh!!! The following night was much quieter. whether this was because I was exhausted from the lack of sleep the night before or it was genuinely quieter, I don't know. However, I was woken at about 1:30am by another guest being sick. Yes people, the walls are so thin I could actually hear the sick hitting the toilet - delightful! Don't let the &quot;ultra comfortable beds, Egyptian cotton bed linen&quot; line fool you. The pillows were like rocks and the bed sheets were dirty.  As for breakfast? It's £5,95 per person and is a &quot;continental breakfast&quot;. Orders must be placed before 8pm so they can go out to Tesco and buy some croissants etc. We decided not to have breakfast from the hotel and bought our own croissants on both days from Tesco. The total came to less than £5 for both of us for two days and included croissants, jam and juice - much cheaper!! On a lighter note, the staff were kind and friendly. "
0; You get the feeling it's all about the money here. Menu's at the bar are too expensive for the food that arrives.   Spa facilities are good and the gym staff were very welcoming and friendly especially a young blonde hair girl who supervised the archery in the morning. We Stayed for a weekend break.  Room was pretty good, food in general could have been better not impressed with breakfast either, it should have been higher quality for the prices.   In summary it's a good place to relax with good decor and lounges etc but it's too highly priced   
0;" When we arrived it is indeed a very impressive hotel, and judging by the Rolls and Ferrari parked out front that it must have some high class customers; our car was parked for us (even though it was a lowly fiesta!) which was a nice touch then having to park and lug luggage back. The lobby, bar and restaurant all looked   However the bedroom led to disappointment given how impressive the entrance to the hotel was. The bed had a very visible dip in the middle and neither this, nor the pillows were particularly comfortable. A large room but really quite drab. The bathroom door wouldn't lock properly so kept swinging open which was annoying! No safe as others have mentioned and yet there is a warning in the folder in the room that you shouldn't leave valuables in the room but you could always give them to reception?! That didn't instil much confidence in me!  The coffee tray was in a drawer in a cupboard and the &quot;mini bar&quot; was a few things on top of the cupboard - not refrigerated! The shower over the bathroom isn't made for anyone tall either, had to duck to wash my hair under it! There is a very popular bar within the hotel it would appear the the noise was still phenomenal when we went to bed at 1am! The windows are not particularly well insulated against noise.   Breakfast was good and check in/out easy. Probably wouldn't stay here again though. "
0;We chose to stay here for two nights when visiting Birmingham because my husband secured a rate which cost less per night than any of the nearby budget hotels. This being the case, overall we were happy with our stay, particularly as the hotel is in a great location and we only used it as a place to sleep. Despite being a little run down our room was clean, was of a decent size and the bed was comfortable. On the down side our room was too warm during the night and the shower was terrible. The public areas of the hotel really are in desperate need of an overhaul. The bar and restaurant were very shabby but as I have said we only used the hotel as a place to sleep and ate and drank in the surrounding bars and restaurants. I also wasn't impressed that Wifi wasn't free within the hotel. In summary I would recommend staying here only if you can get a very good rate (my husband paid £51 per night) and you don't need to use any of the hotel facilities.
0; Stayed here for one night to attend a graduation. Before arriving, requested an earlier check in (1:00pm instead of 2:00pm) as we needed to be at the graduation for 3pm. Quick response stating that it could not be guaranteed but it would be noted. Upon arrival at 1:30pm we were told our room was not ready so we would have to wait. This was only half an hour before official check in so after 15 minutes of waiting around the staff told us we could have a different room with no sofa bed which they would sort out later in the day.This wasn't a problem as we were going out for the rest of the day so why couldn't this have been arranged before we arrived? The staff were generally polite. The room itself was close to the lift so great location, very clean and surprisingly spacious, lovely and quiet despite being in the city centre. Definitely not what I'd consider executive though. Beds extremely uncomfortable, no extra pillows, and not enough towels for three of us. The fan in the bathroom was broke so got steamed up quickly. No mini bar which wasn't essential but thought this would be included in a room described as executive. Also noticed a large crack in one of the windows. We opted for a room without breakfast included and we ate out so couldn't comment on food or room service although from looking at the menu it seems very overpriced. Upon returning to the hotel room late in the evening, our key wouldn't work so had to go back down to reception which was inconvenient but quickly resolved. Paid for the parking whilst checking out but was told we would have to wait for a manager if we wanted to pay by cash, no time to wait so had to pay by card instead. When we tried to leave the car park, did as the receptionist suggested and put the tickets in the machine in the correct order however a message on the screen said to pay a further £20.00, not sure if this was the hotel's error or Q park though. Overall not too impressed with this hotel, it didn't live up to its expectations. 
0;This hotel is ideally positioned a 30 second walk from all the shops and restaurants in Cabot Circus!  It is great that parking and wifi are included in the room rate. However some attention to detail is lacking. For example, on arrival, my door keys did not work at first (this happened the last time I stayed here too). Also, my room had no towels or hairdryer so I had to call housekeeping to get me those things. A workman just let himself in without knocking holding a hairdryer which was weird. The back was missing off the remote which was also sticky. There were a few marks on the carpet and paintwork. The rooms are very spacious but feel in need of a little tlc. Mine smelt like food which meant I had to put the aircon on and spray around my perfume!  Not bad overall, but it's all in the detail which I feel is unfortunately generally lacking.
0; We stayed here for 1 night before an early flight, and it was the first Heathrow Hotel we've stayed in, but if we do it again we'll probably try somewhere else.  We got the airport hopper bus to the hotel, which took half an hour to go about 1 mile - very frustrating! If there are more than one of you definately get a taxi instead! The hotel staff were friendly and the room was huge - 1 King and 1 double even though there were only 2 of us. It was really quiet (couldn't hear any planes overhead) and the bed was really comfortable.  Couple of bad points - our shower didn't work, they tried to charge us for things we hadn't had from the mini-bar and charged us for internet acces, even though when we logged on it said access was free. The charges were taken off however when we complained, although the staff didn't seem too bothered about the inconvenience.  We didn't eat in the hotel (the restaurant was very expensive!) so went round the corner to The Pheasant which a couple of other people have mentioned. It was ok, though don't go there if you just want a snack as the portions are huge! All in all, it was ok, I just exected a bit more of a 'wow factor' with a Sheraton. 
0; Stayed here after a wedding down the road from the hotel. Found the decor very dated, wasn't expecting anything modern as it would ruin the style of the old building but it felt like needed a good touch-up. Bathroom was grotty and toilet didn't flush properly. 
0;We have just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. To be fair I would mark it as good but there is no choice on trip advisor between average and very good, It is a country hotel set in beautiful grounds with lovely old communal rooms. We took a suite which was extremely comfortable and spacious, having a bedroom and separate sitting room and lovely views of the front of the hotel. The room was clean, the bathroom large but had a disappointing shower which was over the bath and really lacked any power. The shower head and pipes were all dulled with limescale and the towels supplied were small and rather hard. My children had a room also in the old part of the hotel. It had character and also looked over the front of the hotel. It was quite cramped and had an unpleasant internal small bathroom. It was also far too warm and hard to open any windows.  They were near the function room and noise from a party kept them up. The hotel basically felt like it had the amenities of a 5 star hotel but lacked true luxury , identity or exceptional service.  On our first day at the hotel despite exiting our room by 9.30 to do activities with the children , It had still not been cleaned or made up by 12pm, I called and asked for it to be done. Having been told they would come immediately when I returned at 2pm still it was unmade.... The swimming pool and spa areas were clean, again the showers in the Ladies changing room , although looking promising were underpowered and just left you feeling flat. For our family the golf was a highlight. For the first night we ate in the Oak room. Food was overall ok to good. Breakfast was ok but nothing special. There was a large choice of buffet but the quality of food was average. We took older children, there is ample children's swimming time and extensive grounds to run about in. There are tennis courts and for additional fees golf. However, there is no included games room with eg table tennis or pool/snooker ( you have to hire it by the hour!).
0; Having recently stayed at the Hotel once again whilst on business after a break of a few months, I thought I would give comment on a few points. I arrived at the Hotel and as always was courteously greeted by the very pleasant Reception staff which is always grateful after a long journey ! They even had all my details on their system, including my car Registration, choice of Newspaper and even the time I would like to get up !! Amazing and much better than I ever experienced at other Hotels!!! However things went a little downhill from here !! Once in my sea view room, which was a complimentary upgrade from Reception, I was still surprised to see a very old TV and even more surprised to find the quality of reception was appalling, I looked at the back of the TV to see if the Aerial was loose or disconnected (which it wasn’t) but found thick dust !! So I called reception and they sent a Porter to assist (French lad), but this was to no avail as he could not improve the signal (he was very apologetic). I then decided to shower and change before my evening meal only to find long strands of hair in the bath plug (very off- putting). The food in the main restaurant was delicious and plentiful and I can only imagine how good the fine dining restaurant food is, but can only hope that the service there was better than I received as the waiters were inattentive, I had to ask several times for wine which arrived after my starter and I found the Maitre D (mid 40’s with a moustache) very miserable and didn’t seem to care. I went to the bar and was served straight away but was greeted by “Yes mate what can I get you” !!. I spent about two hours in the bar working on my laptop using their free internet connection. This is great I would have to pay in any other hotel As I was going to bed I enquired what time Breakfast started and found that it was at 7.30 still, this I must say is very inconvenient as that extra half an hour in the morning make the difference in getting to work avoiding rush hour traffic. Can “cooked” breakfast not start at 7am? To conclude, of course I will be back to this hotel to see if my comments have been valued. 
0;Went for an overnight spa break package and the spa treatments were exceptional! Facilities were also great as well as the friendly staff. 3 course dinner was gorgeous and every member of staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful.  The only criticism was the bathroom in my room which was shabby, especially the rust and discolouring in the bath! But fantastic views and the main lobby and bar area was like being in the 20's but in a good way!
0; We stayed at Nidd Hall over Valentine's weekend with a party of 54. The hotel was lovely and the signature room we stayed in (119) was spacious and clean and the bed very comfortable. It could've done with more light due to it being an inner corner room it may have had a smaller window than the others but it could've definitely done with some ceiling lighting. All of our party was on that floor which was nice.  I don't remember ever coming across a hotel where the housekeepers will not come back later on if you have put the 'do not disturb' sign out for a while after breakfast (even though they work 9am-4pm). In most places I have stayed in the other side of the card says 'please clean my room now' which can be hung on the door when you go out. They do leave fresh towels, toiletries and tea & coffee outside your door though.   On the first night the restaurant was a shambles with everyone coming down for dinner at the same time and the service just not coping with this. Sat & Sun nights were much better and the food was fine but I must say we enjoyed the food at Alvaston Hall more last year. Breakfast was lovely with the usual Warners' options of buffet or dishes ordered to the table. My main gripe with the restaurant would be that it was very crowded, the tables very close to each together (had to turn sideways to go between some tables), and especially at breakfast, if everyone on your table came down at the same time, the tables were too narrow to fit the required tea pots, coffee pots, yoghurt plates, toast etc.  I didn't try the spa or any of the activities but some from out party did and enjoyed them very much. we enjoyed walking the extensive grounds and looking at insect houses and Amber the Owl and many more interesting things. The grounds were well looked after.  At Alvaston Hall we really enjoyed the dining room/theatre where you kept your table and seats all weekend and you didn't have to fight for seating after dinner if you wanted to watch the entertainment or pay for a VIP pass which would guarantee a table for you. The entertainment this weekend was a little old for my liking. Jane McDonald had a lovely voice but it wasn't to my taste. We ended up taking over most of the tables at the Pavilion Bar and peering at the entertainment through the doorway occasionally. The bar didn't seem to have enough staff on for the amount of people. There was often a queue (!) of 15-20 waiting to be served.   All in all we enjoyed out stay but a lot of this is due to the people we stayed with. I wouldn't mind going to Nidd Hall again as it is a pleasant place with a few minor niggles. I am looking forward to trying out Bodelwyddan Castle next year though. 
0; Chose this as it was convenient for airport, stayed 2 days prior to trip and one after. On the first trip we took the offered upgrade to a business room, only difference was a coffee machine which had the wrong instructions provided. Whilst I was in the shower my husband switched on the desk light and we were plunged into darkness. We called reception and this was fixed quickly. I then tried to access the internet with no success went to the concierge and after several attempts no success so spoke to the internet company and finally got connected for 24 hrs (we were staying longer) was told would have to ring again if we wanted more. Breakfast had bee included in our original package but did not enjoy it as most of it was lukewarm, chose to eat at the airport for second visit, hot food and cheaper. Had stayed at a Radisson hotel in the states and had been impressed but very disappointed with this stay. 
0; Stayed at the holiday Inn Plymouth and a bit of a formularistic block. Looks like it was concret cubes craned in all pre built! Also a bit tired but great views, a comfy bed, wireless internet worked OK. Breakfast was fine and as I said, good views!!  For the price I was charged (not much more than some B&B's) you can't complain as they say you get what you pay for! 
0; We booked this hotel on booking.com, we booked an executive room. We stayed in room 1, The room was of a nice size and the soundproofing really worked well, the hotel is on the side of an extremely busy road which we did not hear at all. In fact the evening we stayed, south England was experiencing quite a storm which both myself and partner slept through. The grounds are nice and quiet. We did not eat an evening meal at the hotel, so can not comment on the quality of the food, however the food areas all looked clean and tidy. The bathroom we had was not very good and sort of felt old and tatty, bits of plaster had become damp and had not received any attention. The ceiling had quite dirty looking marks above the shower area. The bed was very comfortable and we did have a good nights sleep. Breakfast was the usual buffet or choice of full English, not the best we have had, however good enough to start your day. Overall with the price of the room, wasn't too bad. My only comment would be is that the bathroom in room 1 really could do with some attention. 
0; We went for a family party. Friendly welcome and pleasant surroundings. The dining room was upstairs. Some meals were ok but two of the party had turkey and all the trimmings which arrived swimming in gravy and looked rather like school dinner's used to. The pizza was large and tasty. The pie was served in a dish with a token wedge of pastry resting on the top. However it was tasty. My steak was cooked as I had requested but the selection of vegetables served with it was small. The waiters seemed to be very busy and this made the meal seem rushed. Because of the occasion we all enjoyed ourselves but I don't think that I would return. We only used the restaurant so cannot comment on the accommodation. 
0; Have stayed in this Hotel a few times and sadly each time has been more catered for Business people . Not very friendly and food not the best . Bed was comfortable and room very clean and functional. No real atmosphere in the Hotel, hence not very relaxing. 
0; My husband booked a post-Christmas two day break here which included breakfast and an evening meal. The room was fine though quite a walk with lots of stairs down to find it. Husband had booked me in a massage in their spa an hour after our check in on the Friday (which was not good! for which I will do a separate review under their spa) but because of injury from the massage we checked out the following morning. However that evening we had our evening meal at 6.30pm which seemed a good time as not so many people about, had no problems with food and all courses were lovely and well presented. Sparkly rose wine was rather nice, so give that a go if you can. Having looked at other reviews on here about breakfast I do have to agree that it is rather disappointing, greasy and free for all, which was a shame compared to our experience the evening before. Not sure if will return but will not risk the spa again! 
0; The Hotel is well located. There is a good bus connection to the Paddington station which I needed. The furniture of the Hotel is quite old. I have expected a bit more from Hilton for the price I paid. The Internt access in my room was not strong at all so at the end I needed to use my data roaming. The staff is kind and takes a great care but I to me they seemed a bit overloaded with work trying to do everything. At the evening I waited several minutes to enter the Hotel which was locked. this surprised me a bit. Overall, the Hotel is clean, only small remarkes for the bathroom. Breakfast was amazing!! Depending on what you are lookig for, you might consider taking a room. (but it does not correspond on 100% with the pictures) 
0; Check in rather difficult because sea view rooms were booked but apparently not available! Pressure to sort eventually led to booked rooms. !!! Really good that proper filter coffee available in room and very comfortable bed. Hanging space for clothes very minimal and bathroom doors provide NO privacy . Could have greater attention to detail. For example sitting in dinning room for breakfast and facing window which showed a pile of rubbish! It was also rather drafty. Warmth in November a MUST. Dinner excellent with excellent service. 
0;"Restaurant manager not on top of her duties and waitresses not trained: Very long service and dishes coming out of kitchen going round the restaurant as waiting staff have no clue for which table they are &gt; complete chaos.  Also when you know the number of rooms booked at the w-end, kitchen to make sure you have enough bacon, scrambled eggs etc prepared to cope with demand instead of having the clients to queue for ages. Only 1 out of 3 coffee machines working at breakfast time!  Comfortable, clean and spacious enough rooms."
0; Went here for dinner last night and to be honest was really let down! The hotel looks lovely - expeptionally clean and the staff were very attentive! The drinks were very expensive - i dont mind if its decent but dont like paying £20.00 for a bottle of Hardys chardonnay! some aspects of the food were lovely! For dessert the Creme Brullee (Rum and raisin) was very nice but then other aspects like an unseasoned tough steak let it down!!   I imagine if you went for the homemade classics it would be lovely - Fish and chips , pies etc. But for an a la carte treat its not the place for us. 
0;The hotel is large, and a bit of a rabbit warren. The room we had was large, and the shower over the bath was good, plenty of hot water, but the heating was dubious - the thermostat said 23 degrees, but it was nowhere near that, and was very cold during the night.  Generally the carpets needed a clean and the décor was jaded or damaged. The front of house staff were lovely, helpful and polite, the bar staff were miserable, and couldn't wait to get rid of us. Good access from the station and great shopping and restaurants nearby make it a good venue for a conference, be careful though, a colleague cancelled their room and didn't get any money refunded (£450 for 3 nights).
0; I arranged a romantic spa day & evening meal for my boyfriend.   Upon arrival - greeted by friendly staff however I was just told where to go to find my room. I had to ask:  - Where to go for our treatments booked  - What the times were for breakfast and dinner - If I could reserve a table  Going into the spa I again had to ask - For a towel and gown which was included in my package  - About the light lunch - Again, where to go for the treatments   The pool, spa rooms, sauna and steam are small.   The room was lovely. Overall it was very clean & maintained. The bed was very comfortable! A bottle of fizz was included in the package which was meant to be in the room upon arrival but was not there, this was upsetting because it would have been a nice touch for the boyfriend.   Dinner - greeted by a lovely gentlemen who was polite & friendly, as were the rest of the restaurant staff. The food was amazing, well presented and delicious. I wanted more even when I was full. It was there I ask for the bottle of fizz - after being confused why we did not have it in our room, they handed us a bottle. The prices are very reasonable, especially as the standard of food was so good.   We missed breakfast. It's only on until 9:30 - I work away a lot and most hotels are 10:30 so that was disappointing.   The hotel itself is beautiful, spacious and clean.   To be in the hotel less than 24hrs (3pm check in, 11am check out) & to have paid £230, having to ask for everything, missing out on breakfast (mostly our own fault) nearly missing out on the fizz, I feel a bit 'mugged'   I'm unsure whether I would return.   
0;" Greeted by friendly Reception staff (always happy to help). Room spacious (deluxe) and very clean - just a little dated, but perfectly adequate for weekend stay. Lovely spa area, again with friendly staff.   Breakfast was fine on both mornings we stayed. Evening meal was lovely - when it eventually arrived! Starter arrived promptly, but then we had a 50 minute wait for our main, which, considering it was salmon and sea bass seemed a very long time? Waiter said it was because they had, &quot;ran out of bowls&quot; ??? Needs to think of a more realistic excuse next time l think!  Booked for afternoon tea next day and this time there was a 45 minute wait - manager came out and offered an individual verbal apology to each table and said there was an, &quot;error with the computer and orders had not gone down to the kitchen.&quot; We couldn't understand why none of the waiting on staff had not thought about going down &quot;physically&quot; to check what the problem was about? The manager only got involved when a hotel guest complained at Reception about it! When it eventually arrived, afternoon tea was delicious and well presented. Staff were very young in this area and l think they just need someone looking over them more effectively - they were all very friendly, but a little stressed.  Surrounding area is lovely to visit and hotel grounds are lovely.  Overall, enjoyed stay and very good value for money - wouldn't rush back but it's worth a visit - well positioned and lovely area. "
0; This was booked as a girls overnight spa break without kids. The overall experience was good, with a good 3 course meal in the restaurant and excellent service from the waiting staff and a relaxing afternoon in the spa. However what brought the break down was a dreadful night's sleep in a room that was unbearably hot, with only one window that opened an inch and aircon that seemed to only make it hotter. The only way we could cool it down enough to sleep was to wedge the door into the corridor open with a towel to try and get some air, but then we woke up at every creak convinced someone was coming into the room. When we complained the next morning we got no sympathy or explanation. A shame as otherwise it would have been an good experience. 
0;I was at a friends wedding on Saturday,bridal party was at this hotel,marriage service was at a nearby church at 1700,after photos etc you would expect to be in the function room straightaway at 1830,no it was not ready until approx 2000,buffet food was announced after 2100,however not everyone got food,bride was furious but there was a lack of staff around,there wasn't a knife to cut the cake,someone had to seek staff to get one,the bar in the foyer refused to serve drinks to wedding party as function room had a bar,a bar that had no gas for the beer pump and ran out of barrels early on ,and there wasn't a huge amount of people about 80,overall a big disappointment especially for bride and groom.
0; We arrived very late but service at the reception and bar was very good even though we didn't get the room upgrade we were promised as it was a special anniversary celebration (very disappointing). They did honour free breakfast which was nice. It was rather hectic at breakfast with long queues into the restaurant and food and drink running out. Could probably extend the time during the week so people don't all end up arriving just before 9.30 when it ends. The rooms and bathrooms need a lot of updating. Not enough storage for clothes, open suit cases and store shoes. Hotel is just about 9 miles away from the famous designer outlet Cheshire oaks which was great, and not far from great restaurants in and around Chester. 
0; The main selling point of this hotel is its central location which provides easy walking access to all the attractions and amenities. It also offers useful parking facilities – but you do have to pay £5 per day.  We had a room overlooking the street, which was a nice size but the bathroom was a little bijou. The main disadvantage was the street noise – as can be expected with the Tudor style, there is no double glazing and building work over the road at Nash’s place also added to it. If we had been staying longer than 2 nights we would have asked to move rooms. As per Aidan177’s review I was also woken up by the LED on the TV flashing during the night!  I would recommend this hotel due its great location, but would advise requesting a room that does not overlook the street and switching the TV off at the mains before you go to sleep! 
0; Just returned from a 4 day break after our second visit to the Skegness 'resort'. We stayed in silver accommodation this time on Atlantic Avenue. Well what can I say...dirty, sticky stained carpets, springs sticking out of mattress and stunk of stale cigarette smoke. Was very surprised to see that they are building yet another restaurant on site, think the money for this would have been better well spent on knocking down most of the resort and rebuilding it as some of it is beyond refurbishing!!  Entertainment was ok but very bitty. Sometimes would have to wait an hour after one show had finished before another one started. Be prepared to que for an hour during peak season to watch a good show!! Food was lovely. We did the premium package. Good variety of food, restaurant clean and staff friendly. Splash was great fun, but very dirty! Loads of hair and dirt on the floor, earplugs and hair grips around the pool area!! All in all the staff were lovely and helpful and the kids had a good time. But it was a dirty, smelly place. This will be our last visit to Butlins unless they give it a VERY good clean up and refurb. 
0; Stayed for a night in the manor and have to say the hotel is great, the room was lovely and clean, the bed was comfy and the room had all I needed for a nights stay...  HOWEVER the ground floor of the stable block is so noisy! I was staying in a room next to a door that needed oiling (sounded a bit like a screeching cat), the other doors slammed shut, and I could hear everything in the rooms next to me and above! Luckily it was just footsteps...I know the hotel had a refurb a few years ago but they really should have thought of insulation as I had maybe 4 hours sleep which isn't ideal!   I would return but would request to not stay in the stable block.... 
0; We live in Ely and chose to have breakfast at Poets House to celebrate a friend's birthday. We expected high standards in all areas.....had a good welcome on arrival at Reception, dining room was pleasant and young waitress very helpful and attentive. Unfortunately I discovered bacon in my vegetarian omelette, not good. This was replaced swiftly, but should not have happened in the first place. We were overcharged and it felt very awkward.....being told abruptly we were wrong. The menu was clear, but having to justify to a staff member that we were correct spoilt what should have been an enjoyable and relaxed occasion. The bill was corrected, but the experience didn't leave a good feeling. Standards of customer service need to be high, and consistently good. Very disappointed. 
0; Positives - Our stay was value for money, all the staff were friendly and professional, the venue was clean and massage in the spa was lovely. Rooms for improvements - 1) At time of the booking I arranged for a King Size bed and called in to sort out a room upgrade, which I was promised would be done when I arrived. It was not so I called reception to negotiate the changes and agreed to pay the additional difference but the staff only moved us to a room next door with a King sized bed. 2) when booked spa treatment we were not informed that the pool was being used for a toddlers swimming lesson so we did not get to use all the facilities as there were lots of children and parents in the changing rooms, pool and sauna area. If we had known we could have chosen a different time to use the facilities. 3) The waiters and menu in the restaurant did not fully explain how the food would be presented/cooked when asked, so when it arrived it was not what we expected and could not eat it. It would have been nice to see other menu options for which we would have paid the difference, but the offer was not made. 4) The heating system would switch on then turn itself off, without us realizing, hence why it was not reported at the time, by the time we got up in the morning and noticed it was time to check out. 5) When I checked out I paid the added differences for the room service and restaurant meal but I was later billed for the bottle of water in the room, which I feel should have been done at the time of check out. So it was not nice receiving a bill in the post a week later. I think a phone call to inform me first would have been nice. I have stayed at a number of Hilton Hotels in London in the past and have never had any issues, so was surprised about the above mentioned and varying standards. 
0; This review is quite hard to write as I can't really decide how I feel about this hotel! I was travelling on business and so wasn't going to spend much time at the hotel anyway. However it is in a great location and the staff at reception were quick and efficient. I was told my room was on the fourth floor and was sent in the direction of the lifts. The fourth floor is currently being refurbished so there was plastic sheeting on the floor and other signs of building/decoration works going on. The hotel is massive so I had to wander around for quite some time on the fourth floor to find my room number! It is a bit of a maze and wandering around the corridors it felt a bit institutional! However when I found my room it was pretty nice. Small but pleasant and clean looking. The bathroom was fine - not new and shiny but perfectly acceptable with plenty of towels etc.   I had a good night's sleep and would stay again if travelling on business. However I wouldn't be too keen to stay there on holiday with the family - it is fine but nothing more. 
0; The hotel is clean but a little dated. Some staff were very pleasant and helpful, others were not. The food was OK, but only ate the evening I arrived as was not too impressed. In my room there was a bible and as a Christian I thought it a nice touch, not something you see very often any more, however, when I opened the book, I was appalled to find that 74 pages had been torn out. Someone was insulted by my religious book, I am even more insulted that someone defaced it in this way, but even more so that the hotel has left it for me to find. 
0; We stayed here for one night after arriving back in the UK after our honeymoon. With flights and time differences we'd gone over 24 hours without sleeping so knew a night in a hotel would be a good idea.   We checked in around 2pm, went straight to bed........ and half an hour later the fire alarm went off for a fire drill.  Now I know these are necessary but surely we could have been told about this when checking in? Other guests were aware it was going to happen so why weren't we told. It wasn't just the fact we were annoyed at being woken up, no member of staff spoke to us or any of the other guests so we didn't know if it was a real fire or not. If we had just stayed in our room nobody would have even noticed. We went back to bed and put a do not disturb sign on the door, only for the cleaner to bang the hoover into it an hour later.  This incident could have been just one of those things that can't be avoided but the hotel itself is one of contradictions. The room was clean, modern and a decent size. It has a brilliant shaving mirror in the bathroom and I assume there was underfloor heating in the bathroom.   However, the shower is the worst I have ever used in a hotel. It is so weak you have to run around in it to get wet, there is free wi-fi but it was so weak it wasn't worth bothering with. The TV has lots of channels but half of them don't work. The hotel has its own restaurant but it is really expensive, probably because they know there are few eating alternatives nearby.   We stayed for breakfast and I must say it is the best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel. It is an ask you can eat system with lots of choice and the food is of excellent quality.   All in all we were disappointed.   Forgetting the fire incident, if they can do something so well like the breakfast why can't they do simple things like putting a decent shower in and make sure the TV works?  It's not that it's a bad hotel because it isn't. It's actually very nice, it's just that we expected more from a Raddison. This was our first stay in a Raddison and based on this stay we won't be rushing to book a Raddison again.  
0; Been twice now to this place first time we had to get moved out of our room but didn't see it as a problem spa was nice, I had one of there tans done mmmm had to go back next day what a mess . Thought we would give it another go a year later my god lets just say we left after two day's with me in tears and my partner trying to find us another hotel. When we arrived home I e-mailef them to say what an awful time we had I received no reply save your pennies and don't do it for a large company that has hotels around the country there after care was shocking never again 
0; We stayed for one night over new years. As I am pregnant we wanted a relaxing luxury break so opted for the best room we could get and booked a suite, we were thoroughly disappointed. Online the pics looked great but on arrival we discovered the bathroom was no different to bathrooms we had stayed in at budget hotels...there was no deep bath as described (although it was separate) the shower was covered in limescale and mould and certainly not powerful enough to be described as a drench shower! The malmasion 'extra' bathroom supplies were shocking. For the first time ever I decided not to pack all my usual toiletry supplies....after all I was staying in luxury and these were stated to be supplied...what we found was one tube of shower gel and one tube of shampoo and conditioner in one!! No sign of anything 'luxury' where one might expect some body lotion, conditioner, bubble bath for the 'deep bath', slippers, robes and toothpaste!  The room, equally as tired and in need of some maintenance was poorly equipt for a luxury stay...no complimentary water, no English breakfast tea,  No four poster bed as described, no Bose sound  system, a stained velvet sofa and a view over a beautiful grey office block!!  We called reception after we arrived in the room to request normal tea and extra shower gel so we could make our own bubble bath. This took two requests and over half an hour to arrive, poor service!  More poor service at breakfast on New Years day....our breakfast took over half an hour to arrive, despite tables arriving after us recieving their food. When it did my eggs with soldiers arrived without egg cups?? And we're rock solid like hard boiled eggs! And my partners breakfast was cold. It did appear their were other diners having the same experience.  The only positive I have to review is the 5 course dinner on New Years eve in the brassiere, this was good as was our waitress.  This is such a shame as had had a good experience in Manchester malmasion previously. I certainly won't be  returning and paying these prices for luxury again at a malmaison.   
0; Was really looking forward to this trip, when we arrived the receptionist seemed to be on 'autospeil' and handed us reams of paper and timeshare invitation, we weren't impressed with this. Had lovely room 4 poster bed etc, comfortable tho a little hot. Very dissappointed that every time we wanted to enter the dining room we had to wait, staff were friendly but poorly trained and didn't understand the basics of speeding up when customers were waiting. When finally given a table, service was slow, the breakfast was cold and toast undercooked. Evening dinner very good, staff need to give customers more attention. Not really 4 class, were put off returning due to lack of ambience and under-managed staff. 
0; My husband and I stayed here last weekend as a base for the Olympics. Parking is cheap at £5. We arrived quite late at about 9pm and found that our air conditioning was out of order. It turned out that there was a big problem with many of the units, luckily the hotel was not full and we were moved within 5 mins. Breakfast was nice but it took about 20 mins, after ordering, for a full english to arrive. The continental selection was very limited for a hotel of this size and standard. At £16.50 I would recommend a 2 minute walk down into Richmond for a beter cheaper breakfast. We didn't try the leisure facilities so I can't comment, the lobby and lounge areas are very dated but seem comfortable enough. The room was nice, clean and shower powerful. In summary it's a nice enough hotel but if the Olympics weren't on and thus prices at other hotels inflated (this was not) I would feel a little short changed. 
0; Having stayed here before decided to stay again as my previous experiences were good. Hotel clean generally, staff friendly but this time I have to say I was a bit disappointed in the bed linen as it seemed a bit stained. It had been washed but still marked. I should have reported this but by the time I realised this I was in my pyjamas and ready for bed. Would I go back here again - more than likely but I would check the bed linen before getting into it. 
0; Recently visited Gisborough Hall for afternoon tea for a friends birthday, having sampled most of the afternoon tea's on offer within the area we decided we would give Gisborough Hall a visit seen as it was 2 minutes down the road. On arrival we were stood about for a good 10/15 minutes before somebody came to see to us. We then explained we had booked in for the afternoon tea... as to which the lady on reception said great, go take a seat... not explaining where we had to take a seat... we eventually found where we were suppose to be (room was lovely, excellent views on such a sunny day) only to be sat there for 25 minutes. In this time other tables filled up and orders were taken, peoples food was brought... Nobody came to see to us to take an order (even though we had pre booked over a week earlier) My friend then had to go up and complain about the service to which she was then ignored until she spoke!!! Eventually somebody came to take our order. 4 Afternoon tea's... simple enough. The afternoon tea came... the drinks didn't until about 10 minutes later!!!!! which I am sure only came as the waitress overheard us saying about not having drinks. The afternoon tea was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING (Which was a shame as I have heard good reviews and it appears there is little consistency with what the afternoon tea offers) The Salmon in the sandwiches was brown in places and crispy, NOT GOOD! The cakes were tiny!!!!!! Not a slice of cake in sight, some of the cakes tasted of absolutely nothing! Overall very poor service and poor afternoon tea (especially for the price) there are places nearby that are of lesser value that offer more and places that for an extra £2 you can have a really wonderful experience! Definitely wouldn't recommend or be returning. Definitely scrubbed off the list as a possible wedding venue also. 
0; The location is super and there are some delightful longstanding members of staff, who are exceedingly helpful and make the stay pleasureable. Disappointed by the inconsistency of the food, which varied enormously from delicious to inedible in Marco Pierre White restaurant. Service, food and cocktails were very good at the Spa! 
0; I stayed here for 2 nights with my partner. The hotel was lovely, it was in walking distance of the city centre in the commercial district. The room was spacious with good storage, a huge bed and lovely bathroom.  The only criticism was the air conditioning (or lack of) in the room. For a 4* hotel I would have expected better air conditioning. The first night the room was so hot that I resorted to going outside for 30mins in the middle of the night to cool down. We did report this to the reception staff and they assured us that the maintenance team would look at the air conditioning but we had the same problems on the second evening too. It made it very difficult not only to sleep but whilst getting ready to go out as the room was like a sauna. The pool area needs serious updating. There was a rickety rusty spiral staircase leading down to the pool from the changing area and there was paint coming off the walls around the pool. I did expect better from a 4* star hotel. All in all, the hotel was average. We paid £300 for a 2-night stay and I was a little disappointed with our choice. 
0; We stayed at this hotel for one night as part of a special birthday celebration. The Hotel itself is lovely and the staff were all friendly and helpful to us. The reason for the average rating is that we were so disappointed with our room. We were expecting something special that reflected the look of the hotel but apart from it being really cramped it was no better than other hotel rooms that I have stayed in that were a lot less money per night. We strongly suspected that the room we were allocated is often used for staff. 
0; We arrived in june for a two night stay, on arrival the hotel seemed very dull from the outside. Finding the car park was a task but once parked up and entered the building it was lovely and clean inside. We passed the pool and gym and went to reception. The receptionist was polite and checked us into an executive room. The executive room was very spacious. The breakfast provided a large choice to eat. The location was brilliant for travelling around bristol.Although eating out for a meal was a problem as the only places to eat was in cabot circus or on the waterfront. The only problem we had was the walls are very thin and there was drunken people in the corridor who woke us up, we phoned reception and they didnt sort anything out. The gym and pool was very handy and kept very clean. The cleaners were very polite although they did take our bottle of champagne out of the room when it was half full. Drinks were quite pricey but expected this due to the hotel chain. 
0; Having paid around £100 a night to stay at one of the world’s biggest hotel chains in a room that was described as ‘light and airy’ we were shocked to walk into ours find it was windowless!   There was a pain of glass in the wall but it was tiny, filthy, didn’t open, and looked out onto the wall of the building next door (about 30 cm away). To catch a slither of sunlight you’d have had to be standing at a certain angle. The best part was the full length curtains! We swapped rooms and were pleased to be given one on the other side of the building which had a balcony door. At least we could let some air/light in.   The beds were small singles on big wheels – so whenever you sat on them they moved. There were cobwebs in our room, hairs on the bathroom floor and the walls were so thin I actually heard our next door neighbour break wind (no I'm not kidding). We were woken up at 2.30am by a loud, drunk crowd and could hear music coming from across the hall.    The hotel is incredibly overpriced – the Costa there charges the best part of £5 for a small Americano and we spotted a fish finger sandwich on the hotel menu for almost £15!! If you plan on staying at this place I recommend you visit the new outlet mall across the lake – there are some great shops and very affordable restaurants.   We visited the spa while we were there and not only were we overcharged but the ‘therapists’ were trainees and it was far from a good experience.   All that being said, we did find the staff pleasant and the breakfast was a good start to our day. Parking was also reasonably priced, plus you can’t knock the hotel’s location. 
0;The rooms are getting refurbished I understand so I shan't comment too much on them. The showers and products are very good.   The food available at the hotel is pretty poor quality for vegetarians, the noise is constant tho I may be on a bad floor for that (2nd) the kitchens or something like that are so noisy from very early on.   The atrium is naff think Costa del naff circa 1990, the staff have been accommodating and there are nice touches in the bar.  
0;"Its a while since we have stayed here and we received a good, friendly and efficient welcome. Perfectly dectorated room with lots of space. We booked for a bed and breakfast rate for 2 nights. Found all staff pleasant, well trained and generally efficient. If you are a party animal this is great for you. Whilst the in-room information 'forbids' you from drinking non-hotel alcohol in your room, I can only assume that this strict rule was ignored judging from the state of the people we met on the corridor when the fire alarm went off after 1 am. Sleep on the Saturday night was virtually impossible,as apart from the fire alarm, party goers were being very friendly to each other at the tops of their voices for hours. I'm not a party pooper, but had to be up early on Sunday morning, so not appreciated. Obviously chose the wrong hotel. Sunday breakfast: we were in the lovely little restaurant by 7.30 am (good to see restaurant opened then) and, again, good staff on duty. However, we were the first in so cannot understand how the freshly cooked buffet breakfast was so cold. The plates were cold. Big question mark here. Regarding dinner; no space for us on Saturday night - full of partygoers. It may have been better later on, but we wanted to eat early. After a full day's work on Sunday (antiques fair), we settled down for an early dinner in the bar. Great starters of humus and olives and polenta chips, again served with aplomb. The main courses arrived, one steak and chips and one lamb kebab, chips and salad. The steak was so cold that the butter would not melt, the kebab was so tough it couldn't be chewed. Thankfully the staff refunded the mains. The point being that we were hungry and would have liked a good meal. This was the second cold meal we had been served that day, so the offer of something else was rejected on the grounds that it may not be hot enough to eat. Overall a decent hotel, where you need to be careful what days you choose to stay. Two nights in December with no heating in the bedroom after midnight is not what I would call comfortable. They have the right idea, but seem to penny pinch on what makes a great week-end away. Sorry, but this is how it was for us."
0; Location - Excellent  Premises - check in/out - my reservation was not in the system, the whole screen system is just a joke. Tourists don't know how to use it and it creates even longer queue when one member of staff ( if she/he is actually there)is helping with questionable IT skills of the clients. Ditch them, have properly manned reception desk.  Room - dark overlooking courtyard, bed not so comfortable. Free toiletries. Now for hygiene reasons I would really ditch the shower curtains - definitely not 4 star!  Staff - ok.  Value - was a good price for the location however wont use again. 
0; Was very disappointed with the service we received booking the restaurant, we was turned away the first evening when arriving as we was told they where fully booked, even though only a quarter of the restaurant was in use and was told to ring or book the next day at reception at 6.00 when restaurant opened, the next night when the restaurant opened I rang a few times know one answered the phones when someone finally answered the phone, i was told It was fully booked and I would have to go and eat somewhere else, I was a little upset as when I came down at 7 only 3 tables occupied and when returning to the hotel at 9.45 I went to check the restaurant only to see anther handful tables occupied, for such a large hotel they should not be advertising such a splendid restaurant if they can only cover about 15 tables a night. I would off thought more staff would have been put on this week especially with the boat show been held this week. 
0; Stayed here whilst attending training course. Staff are very attentive and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast was superb, plenty of variety and piping hot. Both nights I had dinner there, once in room and once in the bar... Again, couldn't fault it, however, due to my lateness back to hotel, I could only get soup and salad. This was lovely but with bottled water was an eye watering £21 bill!!  I was booked for a standard room but was upgraded to an exec room.. This is the only downside... Although the bathroom was spotless, the room itself looked like it needed a freshen up. And my word, it was freezing.... Managed to get the heating to work but it made a racket during the night which didn't help my sleep... Other than that, the hotel is fine overall and well placed 
0;" Got Charged for parking car £5!!  I bought a offer off groupon for me and my neice to go to this spa day and we were both really looking forward to it. When we got there we were horrified that the only parking was a multi story that we would be charged £5 for 3 hours and the price went up by the hour ( no wonder there loaded them hiltons) so needless to say straight away it wasnt going to be a take you time and enjoy the spa day kinda day! More like watch the time as it would be £10 before we left!  We then walked to the lift that said &quot;this way to reception&quot; omggg it was so Badly signposted we got lost and all we could see was more stairs and lift again.. and if it hadnt been for a guest coming down the stairs showing us we were going to walk back through the carpark snd walk all the way outside and round...FINALLY we got to the reception desk but it was busy so we decided to go and find the spa place ourselfs.. On route We asked a worklad who was hoovering for directions and i swear it was as if he was scared to smile incase he cracked his mask! He didnt smile and didnt turn the hoover off And pointed and said &quot;down there!&quot; We couldnt believe how unhelpful he actually was...we ended up going back up to the main reception as the spa was locked! And another man walked us down...FINALLY we got to our destination and we were greeted by 2 girls on reception and asked to take a seat and fill forms in before we got our treatments. While sitting there filling them we didnt get offered our drink (which we got told on the offer we would get )all we got presented with was 7 dirty cups! Left by previous guests. I asked the girl if these were our drinks ( being sarcastic) she then said &quot; eee no im sorry i will get you a drink&quot; to then come back with 2 waters! Not the ice tea as we were told...while we sat waiting and staff were walking past us they  didnt smile.. They looked miserable and heads down sort of attitude... Me and my neice could believe it... Then after 10mins a girl came and called my name and off i went she told me what to expect and left me to get undressed in the treatment room. it was then i noticed there was Nowhere to put your clothes so they ended up on the floor! The 2 treatments i had were lovely i really enjoyed them i cant lie. But the noise of the excersise machines right outside the door were so annoying then after my massage and while getting my facial all i could hear was a annoying man coughing!!!! I had to bite my tounge...When i came out and met my neice she was upset as the girl she had didnt get use the stones for her hot stone massage! And just ended up with a normal one.. Oh and i went in before her but she was out and in the jaccizi.. But we were supposed to be in a hour?? I was in 50mins and her 45! and as for the spa afterwards it was a mightmare as we got followed into the sauna room by a man who sat and groaned at us for 5mins before we left it.. Had a dip in the freezing pool... Then went in the jacuzzi only to have MR GROAN sit behind us groaning again... Neddless to say we left and would NOT go back! this place is over run by the gym!    "
0; Disappointed with the lighting at the venue - we could not see the performance clearly despite sitting at the front. The actual performance was excellent. Upon commenting to the manager we were told that acts were expected to bring their own lighting and we were eventually refunded the entertainment portion of our ticket. Our bathroom flooded during the night and this had to be sorted by Reception as Housekeeping were nowhere to be found. Good was good. Apart from bathroom incident room was good. 
0;" Stayed in two rooms, as a family of 3. We had an excellent offer, which included an evening meal and tickets to the cathedral, in addition to the bed and breakfast. The hotel was within a short walking distance of the city. It had spacious rooms which were clean and comfortable. On the downside, we only chose this hotel because it was a &quot;spa&quot; hotel, and we wanted a couple of days relaxation. The facilities were very basic, with a very small drab pool area encorporating a sauna and steam room. The treatment areas were a bit more comfortable though. The main problem was getting in there, the staff question you as soon as you open the door to go in, they are very abrupt, and actually make you feel like you are invading their space, it was quite peculiar. It wasn't a one off, as we tried to use it more than once. That was when we finally got in there, we each had to fill out full questionnaires first, before we could do anything..... Then 10 minutes later..... When we asked for a towel and robe, we were abruptly told we couldn't have one, unless we all paid deposits for them, this had to be done at reception. So we all three went to reception to collect them, and see if we had to sign anything else to get them.... But we're told we would have to go back to our rooms and wait for housekeeping to bring them...... 15 minutes later they arrived ( old hard towelling robes, and a towel) so we finally went back to the pool reception, to be greeted by the same stern faces, who automatically went to give us an inquisition again, but remembered us, and said ok, you can go through ( no smile included) I won't bore you with the other two experiences we had there, but they were of a similar nature. Just a most uncomfortable experience, and we wouldn't repeat it, I can assure you. The staff in this area really do let the hotel down, which is a shame. On a lighter note, the food in the hotel really was fantastic, it was all faultless, it really was a pleasure to eat there.  If you don't want to use the &quot;spa&quot; this is a very good hotel, but if your after a spa break.... I would advise you look elsewhere. "
0; Today my friend and I used a Living Social voucher for a spa day with 2 course meal that included 2 treatments - a Rasul Thermal Mud treatment and a treatment of our choice from a selection of 4. We arrived at the spa reception to hear members of the gym hard at work and were left for several minutes until someone appeared to check us in and give us rough directions to the lockers and pool area. We ventured into the pool area only to find it was very busy and there were no beds to sit on and it had the general ambience of a pool in a leisure centre. It felt like being on holiday and fighting for sun beds! Not very relaxing to say the least. We headed back to the reception area and taken for our first treatment - the Rasul treatment. Once in the treatment room we were given brief instructions and left to apply the treatment ourselves (exfoliating with salt, applying mud then sitting for several minutes in a steam cubicle (it took us several minutes to find out how to open the door). This was a surprise as I have been to several spas and have never had to apply my own treatment!! Once this was finished a staff member took us to a quiet rest area which was full so we were sent back to the pool area. We went to the cafe for our lunch at 1.00. We had to ask for menus and chase staff for drinks and waited so long for our lunch to arrive we had to rush to our last treatment at 2.40 full of lunch. This was rather uncomfortable as we had a back massage each (which was very good and we did not have to apply it ourselves!!) lying on full tummies.  In summary the spa was not a relaxing experience but we did enjoy the various steam rooms in the pool area and the massage was very good and the only relaxing part of the day. It was overall disappointing and felt like a visit to a leisure centre rather than a relaxing tranquil spa. 
0;" We took some visiting relatives here for lunch, having read the good reviews on TA but we must have gone to a different pub. The floor i the bar area was sticky from spilt drinks, as were some of the table tops.   Fish meals, excellent - very good menu choices but given what we had - very expensive. S & K pie was quite good, the chunky chips with it were very good but no peas, no veg, just a small pot of gravy.  The draught beer was excellent but the service oh dear! I stood at the bar behind one customer who was being served and I was kept waiting whilst another staff member had a nice chat with two young males at the end of the bar. When she eventually dragged herself away from them she addressed me with &quot;Y'aw right?&quot;  I said &quot;no&quot; but no reaction, I think that her mind was elsewhere.  Sorry Mason's but not one for the list to re-visit, if only the Fountain Head had a car park for more than four cars.................... "
0; Very expensive for what you get. A basic room, very disappointing. The leisure facilities are really good pool is lovely. The changing rooms are ok, showers are perfect. The restaurant is ok. I think its the staff and views from the hotel that make this hotel, but for me it nothing special and I wouldn't run back. 
0;I stayed overnight with my daughter as we were visiting the turkish baths.The rooms were clean and had a nice view with all facilities available. The hotel is in a very good location to walk into the town and there are lots of good restaurants within easy walking distance. We didn't get in till quite late and as we got into bed noticed that despite it being a double bed we were sharing the duvet did not quite fit the full bed when we were in it so we fought over the quilt all night! Fortunately it was not a cold night! I also managed to fuse the lights which were very promptly attended to by the night manager (without having to enter the room!). I am sure they would have provided a different duvet or blankets had we asked but as it was late and we were tired didn't ask. In summary the stay was ok as we had a reduced rate but I would not pay the full rate for this hotel.
0; This is a relatively decently priced hotel for the location, we paid £89 per night for a standard room which was clean, functional and with a decent sized bed. The added kitchenette was also a bonus feature as was the free wifi. However there were probably more negatives than positives, parking is a nightmare and beware, explanation of where you can and cannot park is extremely confusing and vague as was every other piece of information we needed/wanted. We arrived early and they were very accommodating and allowed us to check in early. However, the bin had not been emptied in the room, leaving us with nowhere to put our own rubbish.  I have seen other reviews on here that breakfast was included in their room rate and was served in the cafe across the road. This was not the case for our room, or if it was, no one told us this, but then no one told us anything, we were not even asked if we enjoyed our stay on checkout! I have also read that you can get access to sky movies. Again, this was not relayed to us.  If you are going to provide a mini kitchenette in the rooms then really, they should be better stocked. Trying to make scrambled egg for two in a cereal bowl with a fork was not the easiest and an addition of salt and pepper in the cupboard would have been helpful (there were pots but they were empty). There were only two knives, forks, spoons, plates and dishes and no other utensils at all, so if you try to make anything to eat for two people it is a juggling act of what you can use, wash, use again quickly, making the whole thing pointless really. The tea and coffee was not replenished the whole time we were there (4 days) and the milk pots were just replenished once. In other reviews I have seen they had a coffee machine. We did not, just instant coffee sachets and tea bags. Luckily we had taken our own coffee, cream and cafetiere.  Overall it was a good location, clean enough but just not enough attention to detail and certainly not enough clear, forthcoming information. I think I would rather pay a little more and have breakfast included and an absence of a useless kitchenette. 
0; We came here for a family meal. There were quite a few of us (about 14) and so we booked and selected our food in advance. Not a big selection - 3 starters (one was orange juice?!) 2 mains and a few puddings, coffee and mints. The food was nice, but the portions were quite small. I didn’t come out feeling like I'd had a 4 course meal! However, it was 4 courses for £17.50 though, so can't really complain!   The only thing that let the place down was that the waiter provided one dish of veg to go with our mains - there were 14 of us, so we really could have done with a few more. By the time they brought out another dish, people had already eaten half their meals. 
0; My Grandson got married at the Imperial a couple of weeks ago, When we checked in the reception staff were unhelpful and dismissive, We had to walk through a function room,where there was a meeting going on, we then had to go through the dining room,(struggling with our case and wedding outfits) The lift wouldn't work and then the doors wouldn't open, my husband had to force them open.We found a member of staff, who carried my case upstairs, but did not apologise for the inconvenience,Meeting in the bar with the family later in the evening, my daughter went tot the bar at 11.30 to get another drink, The bar staff had packed up and disappeared.We went to go to bed only to find the function and dining rooms in complete darkness, only for my quick thinking my husband would have fallen down the two steps between the rooms,Breakfast was buffet style, make your own toast! which was burnt one side and white the other.toasters need upgrading! Not impressed 
0; We stayed at this hotel as a family for my mum's birthday after eating at the Fat Badger many times in the past. There were 4 of us and we had 2 twin-bed rooms next door to each other. I found that downstairs in the communal areas the hotel was lovely, but the rooms were a complete let down. The room I slept in was quite shabby, with no extractor fan in the bathroom and marks up the walls. The entire room looked like it needed updating and definitely wasn't 4* standard.   We missed the cooked breakfast by 5 minutes so had to eat from the buffet, which consisted of various types of cereal, mini croissants, muesli and 2 different types of yogurt. One of the bowls of yoghurt had an enormous hair floating in the middle of it. The service at breakfast was very poor. There were no cereal bowls left and we had to ask for everything, for example when the toast we asked for was brought to our table, the waitress walked away and we then had to get her attention again to ask for some butter. By the time it arrived the toast was cold.   I would also like to add that the music (maybe from the bar) was extremely loud and could be heard from the corridor on the 2nd floor and slightly in the room. A man a couple of rooms down the corridor was complaining to staff at 11:30pm about being the music keeping him awake in his room, so be aware of this if you are planning on staying on a Saturday night.   Overall I do not think this hotel was worth the cost or the star rating it has been given, and I would not stay again, although I would definitely eat at the Fat Badger again. 
0;" This is a hotel to go to if you like it quiet, or if you have to go to the Open University.  It's located in the middle of nowhere (just like the OU) so don't book in if you're looking for Milton Keynes night life (is there such a thing?).  Rooms are large and beds comfortable. Dinner and breakfast are much better than they were a couple of years ago; I think management must have changed.  All staff are very well trained and extremely helpful. They are let down by a kitchen that takes over an hour to prepare a meal on a not-very-busy night (that's something which hasn't changed with new management; somehow the kitchen here has always been slow).  There's a cute wee pool, more like a big bath rather than something to seriously swim in.  If you're with Hilton Honours (membership free), wifi is complimentary.  Perfect place for chilling out the night before a conference. "
0; Arrived after a day at Lego land only to find Lego land holidays hadn't booked us into the hotel.after changing our booking from the mercue to the copthorne . Staff where really good at sorting it out but this took an hour and when your tired and you have two children in tow.,one of which was ill all we wanted was to get our room. Room was clean but needs a good update. Very dated but at least it was clean. Air conditioning in the room was useless and the room was so hot. Couldn't open the window to get some air in.   Beds where comfortable though pillows where rock hard , we found 2 soft pillows in the cupboard which is not good when there are 4 of us in the room.  Heat in the room made sleep uncomfortable and took all of us ages to go off to sleep.  Breakfast was hit and miss affair. Most of the cooked food was cold but there was a good range of food. Plenty of staff on hand to clear the tables.   We went for a swim and this was pleasant enough. They provide you with towels so you don't have to worry about taking towels. They are a little on the small side but do the job. Spa was a bit of a let down as the bubbles didn't work but it was very warm. Steam room was good .  All in all I would stay here again. Couldn't fault the staff for sorting out our booking which was legolands fault. Just hope they turn the heating down next time 
0; Room was really nice, although some things in need of repair  The Hotel puts itself out to be a foody destination. It does not live up to the hype. A nice starter, fairly good main course, inedible dessert The staff on front desk, restaurant and bar all seemed very junior and inexperienced Bar was not very welcoming Breakfast was chaotic We booked through a deal on Secret Escapes, if we had had to pay full rate, I would have rated it poor value 
0; We stayed at The White Hart for 3 nights and despite asking 3 times for the radiator in our room to be turned off, it was never done, so we were either boiling hot as the radiator was on full, or freezing cold as we had to open the window to cool down. The hotel has recently been refurbished, but clearly the painters needed more training as my 5 year old son could have done a better job on the woodwork! The property itself could be beautiful- the ceilings are high, and the rooms a reasonable size, but it is too 'fussy' with lots of 'nick nacks' around, straw hearts, noticeboards with trite messages on them, etc. The brasserie served food that was passable, and the staff in there were affable. Room and bedding and towels were clean, but the shower leaked all over the floor as the shower screen was not a good fit.  Good, central position for the town though- everything within an easy walking distance. 
0;" We spent five nights here June 2012, Staff very friendly & helpful. Car Parking difficult, small one opposite Hotel is gravel and guests parked very selfishly making it difficult to find space. Large one behind hotel accessed by winding dangerous road and no way in to Back of hotel so had to walk back down road. Menus always the same with just one special &quot;Catch of the day&quot; Fish. Very good breakfast. Nice to have the same table in the Dining room through out our stay. Bedroom pleasant but having asked for easy access from the, lift as we're in our 80s, found we had to negotiate two flights of stairs & four fire doors to reach our room! "
0;" We attended a Wedding Reception here and on first impressions the venue is very lovely. They have peacocks roaming the grounds and the building itself is well kept. We stayed one night and even though £100 isn't an excessive amount; I do feel it was quite a lot for one of the rooms.   The rooms are very tired, tatty/peeling wallpaper, and the bathroom looks very worn. There wasn't even a minibar in our room! Also the beds are so uncomfortable. The spring mattress was rock hard in our room. Would a memory foam/goose down topper really cost that much considering how much they charge for rooms and to host a wedding there.   After previous reviews, I can see they are getting refurbished. So hopefully when the renovation takes place the rooms will be a nicer place to stay.   But besides that, I had a lovely time. Such a shame the rooms let the venue down. "
0; Very comfortable, gorgeous pool, wonderful lovely staff and great setting. Chef/s are clearly talented but the restaurant is a drab and badly lit room. Menu feels as if a talented chef has been asked to design a menu that can command a high price rather than one that will excite and satisfy customers. Didnt eat dinner there more than once. Also found restaurant menu to be expensive despite being a Londoner who eats out regularly. 28 pounds for cheapest main (which was an embasrrasingly small piece of fish). If they changed the menu or added daily specials or offered a short bar menu the restaurant would be full at dinner. We dined with only 2 other tables occupied. Also table wasnt set for our pre booked dinner and as such it was set around us!! Breakfast was variable, excellent and fresh one day and the next day it was obvious some items had been cooked in bulk in advance so were dry and hard. Fix the food and this place will be a force to be reckoned with. 
0; We paid £78 between two of us for one night at the hotel and to leave our car for up to 2 weeks, which was good value considering leaving the car at Gatwick would've cost £100 alone!  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and found the bed extremely comfy. Just a shame there were a couple of stains on the sheets and the floor. We would have also appreciated WiFi at a slightly lower cost, especially as the signal in the hotel was bad. However, the transfer to Gatwick at 4:15am ran very smoothly and was exceptional service, at a decent cost of £4.50 per person.   After our holiday, our flight was delayed by almost 4 hours, meaning our pick-up time for the car was later. We called up the hotel to let them know and they were very understanding and no problems were caused thanks to the 24 hour reception.  Our stay was as we expected, but nothing extraordinary. Would definitely recommend to those staying just for one night before a flight and to those needing somewhere to leave the car. 
0; Quite impressed by this Old English Pub/Inn (?) chain place, room was clean and had good tea and coffee making facilities. TV was in an odd position parallel to the bed. Not much wardrobe space for 2 people but we were only visiting for one night so this was OK. Quite noisy due to the pub downstairs but it all quietened down by midnight, although with lots to cram in to our visit this was later than we wished to go to sleep.   Breakfast was reasonable with one hot option from the menu, my Eggs Benedict was OK with the eggs cooked perfectly although the ham used wasn't great quality and the toast was burnt (! unnecessary). My fiance's Full English wasn't so great but there was unlimited cereals (branded pic and pac), branded yoghurt pots, fruit, pastries etc so this sort of made up for the only-ok cooked breakfast.   Staff were all very lovely and friendly with good information about the local area/transport links etc. The pub is located close to a bus stop for the bus to Bath, which is a very cheap way to see the city and a lovely route there too. There is extensive free parking for the pub off-street and on-street in the pub car park is full, which allowed us to leave the car without any worry. 
0; Stayed here on the 18th August  Upon arrival it is beautiful, grounds are stunning especially as the sun was out !  Room was disappointing - positives was the view as we opened the doors and the very friendly ducks in the morning ... Negatives - small for a deluxe room , seating area was literally next to the bed, wall paper coming off the walls, stains on the floors, luggage shelf falling apart and shower constantly flooded Air con kept coming on by itself through the night and reception had to come to our room 3 times to fix it during the middle of the night    When I went to reception about the shower flooding the bathroom they offered to mop it but didn't offer to move us so again when we showered for the evening and the next morning it flooded.  Dinning - dinner was overall very nice. The service was rushed and they made us order when we were trying to relax in the bar area an hour before our reservation  You could only order off the set menu which left little for choice  Two waitress's brought out my partners birthday cake, put it on the table and walked off.... No singing or even saying happy birthday!   Spa - treatments were fantastic , couples romantic treatment room was beautiful and relaxing.  Pool area was extremely dirty and horrible to walk on... There is no way that had been cleaned in at least two days!     After the room really letting us down and the pool we would not stay here again. 
0; Didn't feel we got value for money - couldn't spend the full 4 hours in the spa due to there being too many people and limited variety on rooms. Food choices for lunch and dinner not varied enough. Staff excellent. 
0;I stayed here for two nights in june. A thoroughly lovely comfortable stay, everything i needed was to hand, nothing to complain about other than maybe a little re vamp, paint touch up here and there. The food at Georges bar and food in the main restaurant were both equally excellent and not bad value for money.
0; We have just stayed in the bridal suite (prince of wales suite) at the Churchill as we got married on Saturday (yay!) The room is really lovely. However, on arrival, we were a little disappointed- when you are getting married the next day it is the little touches that make a place. There were none. We felt a vase of flowers or a glass of something in the room would have made it seem a bit more special. We found also on arrival that we would be charged £10 per night for parking in the onsite car park- when you have paid over £600 for two nights, a surcharge for parking seems ridiculous to us. This price, by the way, does not include breakfast. We were warned that they would struggle with a big group for breakfast, which they did (actually only 8 of us at the same time). We had to ask several times for toast, which then came out cold, and one of our party got her breakfast half an hour after the rest of us, and she was the hungriest of us all! We had such a wonderful wedding (and HIGHLY recommend the Merchant adventurers hall for all events!) but this hotel was certainly lacking. 
0;" We booked a £99 DBB Spa weekend break through Wahanda to celebrate my Sister's birthday. Staff were very friendly and Michael on Front Desk and Tony in the Restaurant/Bar/Spa (he was everywhere!) were particularly helpful and deserve a special mention.  Rooms (425) were very dated and dusty with headboards and bedside cabinets missing. Breakfast and Dinner were good, although tables and cutlery were not cleaned properly. Bar had a terrible odour, as did the corridors. There was a Disco on the Friday night; however, guests were expected to pay the full price to get in (mainly over 50s - so we didn't bother!).  Very disappointed with the Leisure facilities, which consisted of a small pool, cold and damp sun loungers. The steam and sauna were being cleaned at 11am (at least they were being cleaned).   The Jacuzzi had way too much bleach in it and managed to ruin mine and two of my friends swimming costumes - for which we can't be compensated for (don't have a receipt) although, have been offered the opportunity to return. My skin has been itching ever since!  All in all - if you want a cheap no-frills weekend break then 'book away!' "
0; It was cheaper to stay a night (excluding food) and park for the week here than to use the long stay parking. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food in the restaurant very acceptable. It was easy to catch the bus to and from the terminal and surprising as to how busy it was. 
0; Considering this is an exclusive hotel the service is poor and more related to conference facilities, there is not enough staff to cope, the staff are miserable and not attentive, for what could be an unforgettable experience it was more irritating, our apartment was lovely, but the service in the restaurant was slow and inattentive, not worth the money considering there is 6 of us staying, let's hoe that breakfast tomorrow is ok! 
0; I had a one night flying visit here to do some local walking - which by the way is to be highly recommended. On this occasion I travelled alone and so booked a single room described as 'cosy' which, of course, means 'small'. For one night, it didn't bother me too much and it did have an en suite shower. The bed was comfy, cleanliness was average and breakfast hearty but overall I have had better value for money in some other places and think you pay a premium here for its central location. It is a hotel though and the night I stayed there was a noisy event going on - I can sleep through an earthquake but consider this before booking here. 
0;I booked this 2 night stay for our 20th wedding anniversary 'treat'. We arrived and thought the hotel looked lovely from the outside. Check In was pretty seamless and then we went to our room upstairs. The corridor leading to our room looked a bit dated and we were also expecting the 'wow' factor on entering our room but were greatly disappointed with the size of the room and it's decor. There was no room literally to 'swing a cat' in there. The room was clean enough but just looked as dated as the corridor. We were then further disappointed to find there was no 'stand up' shower in the bathroom only a hand held shower head attached to the bath. The bathroom itself was again clean enough but looked dated again. I quite enjoyed my bath on the Sunday morning but my husband who is nearly 6 feet tall didn't appreciate having to kneel in the bath to try and get a 'so called shower'. In this day and age with a 4 star hotel a shower we would have thought would have been a minimum requirement. When I booked our stay I was advised the weekend I wanted was full due to a wedding, no mention of 2 weddings the weekend we stayed. Friday night was difficult to get a parking space but we managed it, just but after spending the whole of Saturday out we arrived back at 8.45pm to find nowhere to park because of the wedding guests! Surely provision should be made for 'hotel guests' but we seemed to have slipped there minds and the wedding parties seem to take priority. I am sure we are all paying guests! Had to park in the gravel courtyard which was a feat in itself when someone parked close to the opening of the entrance and you have to navigate a Range Rover through an already small gap on a narrow lane! Breakfasts were good but on Sunday morning because of the wedding the day before the restaurant was full of wedding guests, staff were in short supply and having to chase them around to ask for toast and tea was unacceptable. The dinner service in the restaurant on Friday night was exceptional and the food also, just a pity the rest of the service wasn't as good. Maybe this hotel needs to concentrate on being a 'wedding venue' rather than letting it's hotel guests down at the expense of their wedding guests!
0; I booked a triple room here for a long weekend and thought it looked really nice. I had a look at previous reviews which mentioned the broken lift and issues with the key cards not working. I decided to book anyway but lo and behold the lift was not working on our arrival. To be fair someone did offer to carry our bags, but the lift should have been fixed ASAP. On two occasions on returning to our room, I had to go back down to reception to get the room card re activated. Not much of an apology was given, as if the staff were used to these door problems. Breakfast was good, if a little overpriced. I was re-imbursed one day for overcooked eggs! The location is great for visiting york and our room was lovely, although our room phone was missing! This was mentioned but no phone ever arrived. This hotel has the potential to be really good but the staff really need to pay attention to the finer details. And please fix the lift! 
0; Stayed one night on a midweek stay. Check in was quite efficient but I had to ask when breakfast was served. The room was spacious, clean, quite well decorated, functional (free 2 hour broadband) and reasonably priced for such a central location. The hotel had a refurbishment a couple of years ago and appears to have realigned itself from the luxury leisure market more towards the middle-management (up a notch from Premier Inn) business/conference clientele (weekdays). At weekends, an insider has told me that the hotel targets hen-parties, functions and the like so if checking in for the weekend, ask for a quiet room. My request for a quiet room (not overlooking the tram lines) was cheerfully met by the reception desk - I was assigned an interior facing room which overlooked the large atrium area from above and was fine.   The only downside in the room was that there was no hotel directory or information on hotel services (as well as two restaurants, it has a gym, hairdresser etc). When I checked, this appears to have been an oversight and a directory should be in every room. I did not eat there on this occasion but I did notice that the general wine list is exceptionally poor and unexciting (for those hen parties maybe?) and did not feature for example any French wines other than a cheap champagne. There may be a better selection available in the flagship French Restaurant. However, there are many bars and other hotels nearby (the Radisson just down the road does have an excellent bar).  Breakfast was a buffet arrangement in the Colony Restaurant and the staff were very attentive and helpful. In fact, this was one of the most efficient breakfast services I have encountered for some time.   All in all, budget allowing, I would recommend this hotel for a short stay but ensure a quiet room is available especially if checking in at the weekend. 
0; Arrived on a rainy Saturday morning and approached and parked with no problems in the hotel car park, however the beach was empty due to weather. Had to wait 2 hours for the room as we were early but the children joined the arts and craft session while Peter took us on a mini tour. Peter was by far the most pleasant member of staff we met during our stay. Took a superior family room for 2 adults and 3 children at £360 dinner bed and breakfast. Room 104 was sea facing and comprised a double and 3 single beds. You can look down into the conservatory from the bay. I would say the table and 3 chairs overcrowded the room when used as a 5 bed but the 2 room option for families is really overpriced. The view was of Carbis Bay Beach from the huge bay window, and I was disappointed that only the side window opened. The hotel is a bit isolated and the walk to St Ives for dining options is just too far with young children every day. The walk even to get the bus is a very steep hill. Parking in St Ives is very difficult so we didn't risk taking the car into town and losing our parking spot at the hotel. Service from the bar, conservatory or Sands Restaurant is very slow. Expect 20 mins for a coffee from the bar. Lots of customers complained about this. Service in the Sands was very impersonal, after 3 days breakfasts and dinners we felt invisible, just another table, no small talk, no enquiry about our plans or our day. No fuss made of our three children. The head waiter has a sour expression and his abruptness is quite rude to holidaying guests. The menu was disappointing, our 10 + 11 year old found the childrens menu very babyish in both appearance and choice however the adults menu was too rich and for adults and children all meals were unbalanced. No one hear has heard of 5 a day as veg was rarely served with meals and only at a supplement. The adults portions are small but the childrens fixed menu differed in size from day to day, no consistency. The childrens entertainment is not coordinated at all with meal times or the extreme length of service, so dining at 6pm our children still hadn't had puddings by 7:30pm when the films were shown. The entertainment programme in the afternoons for children suggest 2-4 pm beach fun. But over 3 days no Carbis Bay staff were on the beach during those times. I complained about this at reception who werent really able to explain but I think beach fun is just a suggestion to families to visit the beach independently. The website suggests an array of beach fun to be had at Carbis but Ocean Sports is an independent who you pay for hire (we found out on checkout that a free taster session for guests). More must be done to help families access childrens activities. The things we enjoyed were the pool and comfortable loungers, the jazzuzi and the spa treatments, the best Ive had. Missed eating out in St Ives, a highlight of previous trips so would stay nearer town if came again. 
0; We stayed at the hotel as we were celebrating a friend's birthday. The room was comfortable and spacious and the staff friendly and helpful.  The hotel was fully booked and very busy. We didn't realise how busy until we went down to get our breakfast. We had to wait in a queue for 20 minutes just to give our name and room number to the lady who was allocating tables. After a further 10 minute wait and being no nearer to getting into the restaurant, we gave up.  The receptionist refunded the cost of the breakfast without any hesitation. It does seem ridiculous that the hotel were unable to adequately accommodate the number of guests staying. Extra tables should have been set up so that guests were able to have breakfast.  Apart from this, our stay was very pleasant. 
0; Christmas lunch £75 per head, not including any wine/soft drinks. 3 adults , one 5 year old. Children's portions? Non-existent. Waiting-on staff were excellent. Upon booking, we were advised that coffee & toys upstairs for children. Main meal arrived all served on a plate including gravy. We expected for an 'up-market' Hotel/Restaurant, a dish of fresh vegetables & gravy served in a jug, so diners had a choice. Child's portion, same as adults, just on a different plate. Staff did source some garlic bread as a starter for 5 year old. 4 huge long pieces arrived! Main meal was 'just warm.' On going upstairs for coffee & toys after meal, no coffee in thermos jug & no-one to serve anything. Toys for the children?? Just one huge Wi-ii board already being used. We went home! E-mailed manager, he apologised but said they had never had toys upstairs. E-mailed him again to ask him to check with staff member who took booking who told us there were. We didn't 'dream it up!' No response. Will we be spending THAT kind of £ again on Christmas lunch which was no better than 'good pub grub??' Totally spoilt our Christmas lunch out. Spending THAT kind of £ , we expected better. But well done waiting-on staff! 
0; Stayed here for one night, the room was nice but just a bit dated, the corridors and paint work was a bit tired. We had some nice drinks at the bar and the tortilla chips were nice, but maybe overpriced at £8. The hotel had a singer on in the bar at night and we were amazed as she had a great voice. The bed was comfy but the room was too hot so we had to open the window which backs onto the a main road so was very noisy. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was nice, we paid £10 but it advertised as £15 on web so glad it was cheaper as wouldn't have paid £15.  Overall a nice stay. 
0;" Two friends and I chose this venue for a spa break this weekend. The hotel had two weddings and a number of coach parties on &quot;Mystery Tours&quot; ,among other guests, and the place absolutely thronged.  Sadly they also seemed to have an unusally large number of staff who were&quot;on their first day&quot; !  But to their credit, all the staff were well mannered and helpful despite the fact that the details and finer points of service had not yet been drummed into these newbies. The room was clean and the shower spotless! When failings were pointed out to the powers that be, they could not have been more helpful or conciliatory. Special mention to Adam the bar manager, Adam the duty Manager and Bianca the food/catering Manager for their help. "
0; Unfortunately we feel we had a reluctant welcome to this, otherwise, nice hotel in Grassmere. Having secured a reduced-cost, last minute booking, we were made to feel somewhat uncomfortable on our arrival and during our stay by the management and staff - as though they were in fact doing us a great favour by allowing us to stay. Perhaps the warmer welcomes are reserved for those paying full room rates? Otherwise, a pleasant hotel - room decor good (we stayed in a suite), breakfast good but average for a four star hotel, and hospitality could be better. The spa facility is very nice, but be aware - it is closed every day until 12 noon, so can't be used on the morning of checkout (by 11am). Having stayed in some lovely hotels in this country, and having high expectations of this hotel following recommendations, we must say we were sadly disappointed in the Rothay Garden. 
0; Friendly front of house staff ,clean large room with a lovely large bed.TV remote was difficult to use as the buttons kept sticking, room hot & could not work the air con . Gardens are in need of TLC very bland & the small non babbling brook down by the two bridges is full of litter / dirty - put some flower beds in !. Little over priced £120 for a standard room for one night with no breakfast incl . 
0;" We had a special offer spa day for two from wowcher at a very reduced price, that included afternoon tea and two treatments each and full use of the spa&quot;facilities&quot; for the day. Someone messed up the booking details, when we went for our treatments the poor girl was mortified that she had been informed two treatments for one person! She said she could book us in for another day! We had a round trip of 110 miles, so not really practical.We agreed on a treatment each and she kindly added a danish pastry to our afternoon tea! The treatment rooms could do with freshening up and refurbing, a bit dated, door to rooms slams shut and disturbs the peace, and I was aware of someone flushing the loo upstairs, which also disturbed my treatment.Treatment was ok, but there is nowhere really to sit quietly ,relax in your robe and read your book, only the pool area, we were unable to find the &quot;lazy river&quot; which was advertised on the website.Bit of pain to have to get dressed again, every time you want a drink or snack or just to sit, as you have to go upstairs to the bar area. Also, not really suitable for any disabled people or older people with knee problems...no lifts and lots of flights of stairs from main reception to leisure area. All in all, pretty average, would have been very disappointed if we had paid full price,not really a true spa facility, a leisure area tacked on to the hotel which needs updating and generally sprucing up. Looks like well used by local people, but not worth travelling a distance to especially. However, spa therapist and barlady were very sweet and friendly, did their best to look after us. "
0; I stayed at the Marriott in York for one night over the weekend and I have to sat it is a fantastic hotel. It is clean and tidy, food is good, rooms are lovely and spacious and location is amazing. Overall it was a great stay and yes I would stay again. However the stay was let down by cold staff who weren't exactly friendly and weren't chatty, it felt as if they were there to do a job and that was it. There was no friendliness and no building of relationships. The woman on the bar shut up the bar and left at midnight without a word to anyone sat in the bar, she just disappeared. Tough luck to anyone wanting a late night drink and the people at breakfast were very miserable and just pointed to a table to sit at. I have stayed in many Marriott hotels before and enjoyed all my stays, hence why I keep choosing them. I would say the York Marriott is by far the best building and best location however they could learn an awful lot from staff at other Marriott hotels such as Durham where they are incredibly friendly, happy and personable people. A good stay but could have been made to feel more welcome. 
0; Stated here before flying out to the states, which really reduced pre-flight motorway stress.   Pros: good location, helpful staff, nice clean room, free transfer to your terminal.  Cons: noise. No air traffic noise, but our bedroom looked out at the railway station, so could hear not only the trains but the constant tannoy announcements. We could also hear next door's TV through the wall. Window was fully closed, but still drafty - felt and sounded like it was still open. 
0; The hotel is in a great location near Westminster. Stayed there four years ago and was greatly impressed by the modern style of the rooms. However, the rooms now need to be refurbished. The carpet was clearly old with some big stains, there were stains on the wooden unit, the fridge was empty and unplugged, the crockery in the room was cracked and tea and coffee was not replenished. The pillows were hard and lumpy. These may seem to be minor issues, but one expects more from a four star hotel. 
0; This hotel is about a 20 minute drive from Terminal 5 and about 25 minutes from Terminal 2. There are frequent busese going to and from the terminals costing £9 return. A timetable can be obtained from the hotel reception. A good choice if you have a bit of time to get to and from the airport. Location is more towards Feltham and Hatton Cross. Opposite the hotel there is a selection of take out places. Pizza Hut and an Indian. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Rooms are fairly basic and spacious but comfortable enough for a night's stay. Bathroom has a bath and shower, nice and clean. Would recommend if you're on a budget otherwise there are better options directly linked to the airport terminals. 
0; Stayed here recently. Nice place, comfortable room & nice products in the suite we had. Breakfast wasn't great, they clearly hadn't understood our order & sent lack lustre poached eggs & very little else. No toast or coffee. There was no offer to correct this. Sadly for me, the company I was with was even more lack lustre than the eggs, so no reflection on the hotel itself. 
0; The staff were very helpful and cheerful but we always had the feeling they were trying to too much. They forgot our requested travel cot. We had to wait 15 mins to be seated for breakfast with a hungry 10 month old and a 3 year old. However when we were seated, the breakfast was a very good section of well prepared options. We stood in a line with 7 others, waiting for towels in the spa, while 'Liam' chatted on the phone about gym memberships. There were nothing like enough loungers around the pool as spa was full of day visitors. The room was near the lifts which were used late into the night and were very noisy. 
0; We had our Christmas meal there on Friday 16th December 2016. The surroundings are good and the service was efficient. I think the Christmas lunch may have been good if the Roast potatoes were not too tough for a lot of the group to chew, as was the Yorkshire and stuffing which seemed to have been cooked a long while before being served. The plates were cold as were the vegetable which looked delicious and I'm sure would have tasted lovely if they had been hot. On the plus side, my soup and the desert were delicious. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to upset the lady who had gone to the trouble of arranging the outing, but afterwards found that I was not alone and several people commented on the above points. 
0;" Overall the hotel was good but little touches could have made it a great experience. Everything was just OK, no fantastic experience from the staff. The room was fine but the bathroom was past it &quot;sell buy date&quot;. Really didn't get that feel of value for money. "
0; I occasionally drop in at the Hotel du Vin for business breakfasts and on two recent occasions was disappointed to be given doctored ketchup in a Heinz bottle. I do know my Heinz tomato ketchup and it was far too vinegary both times. Odd really given that the full English breakfast is otherwise fine - but pretty cheapskate. Polish up your act Hotel du Vin, Cheltenham. 
0; Arrived at reception and the guy at reception was on the phone, didn't acknowledge me waiting and carried on his conversation for the best part of 5 minutes. I had booked the cheapest room with private bathroom and he upgraded me to an en-suite at no extra cost. Room was OK, although the lighting was poor. The room was quiet at the back of the pub overlooking the car park/service area. Couldn't get the TV to work and eventually realised that the ariel need to be plugged in with the lead running across the entrance to the bathroom. Trip hazard? Bath was very narrow. Didn't eat there in the evening. Breakfast was OK and they supplied Gluten Free bread which I had asked for in advance. I found the entrance and exit to the residential side of the hotel slightly intimidating as a single female having to walk through the bar every time I entered and exited, locals eyeing me up as I struggled with my suitcase, lap top and other bags. I suppose I would have felt differently had I been with someone else. Burford is a lovely market town and the Golden Pheasant is well placed for shopping there. 
0; After reading many good reviews about this hotel me,my girlfriend and our baby decided to stay here for New Years Eve. Arriving at the hotel outside looks spotless and we was excited to get checked in.   However on checking in we was served by a young gentleman with short dark hair. There was no welcome or no smile. We have never stayed at a marriott before, and was unaware of the process of checkin-in. After signing a few details I was handed a room key and he just looked straight back at his computer. I asked where the room was as it seemed we was checked in. To him replying that he needs to take a £50 deposit. (Unaware of this when making the booking but was not a problem)   As I work in the hotel industry I am aware of of it all works however I did not feel welcomed at all and there was no customer service. As it was the festive season it would of been nice to had some interest if we had any plans for new years ect just simple friendly chat, a smile would have not gone a miss either. Rather than making us feel that we're disturbing him and that he didnt want to be there at all..  The rooms was spotlessly clean and was an amazing price for what we paid for. Wifi is quite pricey. All was fine due to the lack of customer servce which will make me question to stay in a marriott again. 
0; Overall we had a lovely time during our stay at the Malmaison. We stayed on a Sunday evening on a special offer the hotel is currently running, where you can stay for £25 if you spend £75 on dinner in the brasserie. This deal is for a standard room, however, you can pay £15 to upgrade to an original cell room which is what we did.   The room itself was quite roomy - it was three cells knocked into one room. The bathroom had a nice rolltop bath along with a really big shower cubicle, although the shower didn't work very well - there was only a trickle of water at best.   Dinner in the brasserie was nice, we had pigeon breast and mussels to start with which we enjoyed, followed by brill which was fine and the vegetarian option - vegetable and gruyere souffle. The souffle was served in a red hot pan which I burned my arm on several times because it was quite difficult to eat without my arm knocking the handle, it was also too rich as it was just basically cream and cheese melted together. The chips and spring greens were delicious though! We spent over two hours in the brasserie as the service was really slow.  As other reviewers have said, we found the bed to be too hard and didn't get a great nights sleep due to being uncomfortable and there being quite a lot of noise from outside (think the windows are only single glazed) as our room overlooked some of the bars and restaurants next to the hotel, there was also some noise from a nearby alarm going off for a while. The shutters on one of the windows didn't block out all of the light either.  Even though our stay wasn't perfect, I did think the hotel itself was lovely and in a great location, the cell rooms have been renovated really well and I would stay there again. However, I wouldn't pay the standard rates to stay, only on the Sunday night offer! 
0;" Stayed for 2 nights around the Henley Regatta. 1st night had nice meal until we asked to sit outside for desert, waiter said no problem, great...then they simply forgot about us, we had to ask to order, ask for drinks, chase and generally remind them we were here! Then one of the worst nights sleep due to a broken bed. Manager in charge next morning resolved with an upgrade to a suite, which was great service, they moved us and made it easy, which was appreciated. Upgraded room was great and bed comfy which was much welcomed after such a terrible nights sleep. However the place is let down by some team that are simply not well trained enough for the standard of service you are paying for. They talk loudly about other guests, and generally gripe about things in an inappropriate way. I also wonder if they are on commission for drinks....first night, bottle of wine, poured by team gone in 4 huge glasses, then in the final hour while waiting for a taxi, we were &quot;up sold&quot; when we asked for a double gin and tonic, it cost a staggering £30 for one drink, which we didn't know until the bill came, for me, this is not on...food, generally average. Eggs on first morning were terrible, next morning great, so no consistency. Steaks not cooked as ordered etc... "
0; Having never been to the Cotswolds before it was something of a lucky dip picking a hotel or indeed a village to stay in. Tripadvisor was very useful and we settled on this hotel. We booked for three nights on the Sparkle package which provides DBB and a glass of Prosecco with dinner, booked a superior room and duly arrived on Tuesday afternoon. The room was lovely, very spacious, two easy chairs, tea etc and the added advantage of a coffee machine. Bath robes provided and Molton Brown toiletries, very nice. Slightly suprised to find a double bed in such a nice room, a king would have been more in keeping. Drinks in the bar before dinner, staff very pleasant and helpful, dinner was 'fine dining' (think Masterchef) very decent meal if a little pretentious, service quite slow as a large party of Japanese tourists were also in residence but acceptable. We had a walk round the stunning gardens after dinner and had a peaceful if cramped sleep. Wednesday similar experience but service faster, large party were eating elsewhere. We returned to the hotel on Thursday afternoon to see that a wedding party was booking in - we had noted that weekends were busy due to weddings but - hang on Thursday isn't a weekend!  Had booked dinner for 8pm and arrived in the bar at 7.40 - it was packed, hotel has a policy of 'no jeans/ shorts' for dinner but people in both were wandering in and out of the restaurant. we were served a drink and given a menu, 8.10pm and still no-one had taken our order, staff were dashing back and forth in a panic stricken manner not a restful enjoyable experience! We decided enough was enough and made our complaint, asking for our bill to be adjusted to B&B for the night. We got a very good meal in the hotel down the road. When paying the bill next morning the receptionist was very decent and apologised for the trouble, apparently not all of the diners were resident but part of the wedding party, we accept this and appreciate that a substantial part of hotels income must come from weddings, however this spoiled our experience on our last night. 
0; On arrival for our Sunday lunch we unfortunately were not expected because our booking had gone awol, however, the staff quickly sorted out a table for us. Our main problem was the meal itself which was very poor, ( we made no complaint at the time as this meal was being bought for us). The leek and potato soup was weak and very bland, the pasta dish was under cooked and tasteless, and the desserts of bread and butter pudding had been warmed in the micro wave oven and was rubbery with custard and not clotted cream as on menu. There was no changing facilities for our baby, and we were told we could change him on the floor in the ladies, which is totally unacceptable, we were then shown into a previously used and unmade bedroom to change him on the floor there instead. On our return to our table the hot drinks had arrived and imagine my surprise at being brought as a hot chocolate drink, 1 sachet of hot chocolate with hot water to make your own! Unfortunately this review is not a good advert, and as such is the first poor review I have ever made. A return at the moment is highly unlikely. 
0; We booked up here as we had stayed here in 2013 and thought it was great, however this time it seemed to have gone down hill. When we got to our room we were greeted with a horrible fishy smell, very off putting! We did not bother complaining as we were literally only in the room to sleep as we were leaving early the next morn for the airport. Room looked very shabby and needed a lick of paint, bathroom very grubby.  Shuttle bus to airport very good 
0; As others say the venue looks stunning from the exterior and parking etc is fine. Our welcome at reception was friendly warm and helpful which was encouraging. Our room was in courtyard and for me felt chilly but it was a cold night and once the curtains were closed it did warm it up though they block the heat from the radiator unless you tuck them into the window sill. That said it's a castle for heavens sake so expecting double-glazed windows would be stupid. Our room was fine -on the whole very clean but fabric on ceiling would have looked better with cobwebs removed- fairly compact with period furnishings and bathroom and all linens were absolutely spotless.  We were here for a casino night and were not sure exactly what to expect but were all keen to have an enjoyable night. Thank goodness our expectations were not too high. Guests were spread over two rooms - our party all seated together tho. Wine we ordered was poor. Rose drinkable (with lemonade) white was rancid and red was so bad Sarsons would have flushed this away. Bar prices were expensive but this was expected, but being charged different amounts for same round is annoying and leaves you feeling a bit ripped off at times. The meal was pretty good bearing in mind the numbers all to be served. Main course nicely cooked and hot and xmas pud was nice but cold. Service was very slow though and by 10 o'clock when we were expecting things to liven up a bit we were still eating. Thankfully we were in a group and we enjoy each others company so we had a laugh but the service became tedious.  The casino night billing was a complete waste of time yet we mostly enjoy a bit of a flutter so were looking forward to this. Only two tables- so fine if you want to scrap your way in- but we were wanting a chilled night we could enjoy as a group and this was no good for this. Blackjack/pontoon on one table (6 people playing at one time) and a roulette table. You play for toy money which is what you expect but everyone plays down to a single winner for a manky bottle of plonk for the whole event This seemed to disappoint a lot of people. Disco was in the adjoining room where others had dined so they had their designated tables so we did not feel included. For some this was not a bad thing and others in the disco room might have preferred to be elsewhere as many retreated to bar. Choice in advance may have helped manage this expectation? Best fun of night was flipping plastic beetles from crackers into the empty cups whilst awaiting service which is a bit sad.  Don't get me wrong it was not terrible but for the money I felt it was overall very poor. Highlight of night was a guy called Andy who I think may have been a duty manager - he was so helpful, amusing and is a great advert for this establishment. High point was probably breakfast. We found service excellent,choice great and food beautifully cooked. For the price I felt the stay was poor value for money but would be happy to return if someone else was paying eg conference etc. Paying full price I would spend my cash elsewhere. Beamish Hall and Ramside are both fairly close and for me I would choose these over the castle I'm afraid. For me hotel was good but not great Casino night to be avoided as it was pretty rubbish. 
0; We stayed here for our anniversary treat after visiting a while back for dinner. We'd had such lovely food and were treated so well that we thought we'd treat ourselves to dinner bed and breakfast. We paid an extra £30 for the a la carte menu as it was beautiful the last time.  We arrived, but our room was not ready and were asked if we minded waiting in the lounge, maybe have a drink. Not a problem, ordered a large glass of wine and a bottle of beer, paying about £17.....bit steep, but oh well. Two minutes later the receptionist came round the corner with drink vouchers.....bit late to be honest and we weren't told about them before we ordered the drinks. Went to our room which was pleasant, on the small side but clean and fresh. The bathroom was very tired and dated, shame.  Went down to dinner and was taken straight to our table, we were offered the menu, as we had paid for the a la carte we were going to order from this, however when the waitress showed me the menu of the week I decided to go with this. Unfortunately I wish I hadn't, the starter and sweet were lovely, but my beef was very chewy, left most of it. Waitress saw that I had left most and very kindly offered to get the chef to flash fry me something, but I said no thanks. She then gave us a glass of bubbly each. Lovely young woman. She also overheard us talking about our anniversary and gave us a some sweet treats with Happy Anniversary written on the plate, nice touch. My husbands meal was lovely, no problems. The next morning we went down for our breakfast, very busy, felt quite cramped. Table not laid our properly as it was a table for four that had been split to fit in two couples. We ordered the full English, how disappointed we both were, one slice of rock hard bacon, one small sausage, two rock hard fried eggs and very greasy. They had run out of hash browns. I asked for extra coffee, but after waiting quite a while I gave up. I have had better breakfasts at Premier Inns, this is not right. We then went to book out and we told that we owed another £15 on top of our drinks bill, when I inquired what this was for they said it was for the upgrade to a la carte food. I explained that we had pre booked this, in fact I should of had a reduction of £15 as I didn't have the a la carte in the end. With the drinks bill coming in at £37.30 our total bill was £271.30, I expected a lot lot more. The grounds of the hotel are stunning as is the hotel but we will not be celebrating here again. Very disappointed. 
0;" Went for a special romantic night away, so paid much more than normally would. Did expect amazing , but although the room was all top quality bedding furniture it was very small and not much moving around room. The bedside tables had so much &quot;stuff&quot; on them, no where to put our personal bits, plug to charge phone hidden under to table, also tiny and full. So to boil a kettle had to move things off bedside table. Coffee machine was faulty and spewed out cold coffee, & only 3 pods for 2 people,  Bathroom was large though, and water was hot, bed was comfy, but with all the extra bitty pillows that had to go on floor, it all got annoying, Pillows were the best ever!! Drinks at the bar were OK, expensive, and new barman struggled to know the wine. Breakfast service was slow, took about 20 mins to get tea/coffee, then food, which was small portions, has to ask for tea choice as wasn't asked,  I feel the staff didn't go to anyy special lengths to be friendly, and reception staff were new, and only gave some info when showing us the room, didn't show how to use air on, as not simple.  It was lovely and we made it special, but considering the cost I was disappointed, as it should have been so much more. Hotel is very pretty, BUT?..... If you book at premium cost I would expect premium room. Suppose to be romantic break, but both left feeling it marred our time way. Not saying don't go, but we didn't feel elated at experience. "
0; This is a lovely hotel. Our room was great value for money. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was great. It was very quiet and peaceful where we stayed . The view wasn't great but we didn't mind that as we were out and about in the day. The pool was lovely .  If you want somewhere nice to stay I'd recommend this hotel however the staff we met, apart from one person, let the hotel down.  When we checked in we were told our room wasn't ready so we said we'd wait in the bar. There was no hello, no welcome to the hotel, no chit chat at all. It was quite a cold reception.  Apart from our trip out Friday night when the receptionist looked up from the desk, smiled and wished us a nice evening, no other receptionist looked up on our entry and exit, never mind smile and wish us a nice day, welcome us back or even just acknowledge us with s smile ! Very disappointing .   When we went to the bar we had to go back to reception to ask if anyone was available to serve us.  If the staff were more customer orientated and made us feel welcome I'd rate this hotel much higher 
0;" We stayed here on our wedding night so arrived very late, what attracted us here was the spa facilities plus the location.   Although we were holding a lot of things from our wedding that day (i was still in my wedding dress), the receptionist did not congratulate us or even offer to help us to our room. Which I thought was a tad rude, I come from a customer service background so believe in going that extra mile for customers.   We had the luxury room suite, which was a very large size with good view of the sea and Hayling Island bridge. The following morning, we did wake up 15 minutes late for breakfast (which we had already paid for well in advance, when the room was originally booked). My husband called the receptionist straight away to ask if we could still get something or be reimbursed etc, but the receptionist just stated a very firm &quot;no&quot; and that was all!   Due to missing breakfast, we had lunch at the braisserie which was lovely. The staff here were more friendlier, thankfully.   The spa facilities were lovely, with a nice size pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna  Wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this hotel to others, but it would be ok for a one night stay just hope the customer service is noted from this review and worked on for future guests. "
0; I stayed for 3 nights and the overall experience was a bit underwhelming.   The room itself was small but comfortable however I could not sleep very well due to a continuous noise from behind the wall. I was told at the reception that if this was not air conditioning (which it wasn't) they could not do anything, which was quite disappointing given the level of service one would expect from Hilton... Also, there were no biscuits provided in the rooms (I know, everyone is going healthy these days but I love my hotel biscuits!) and the hot chocolate was only replaced 2 days after I drank it. Only 1 herbal teabag was provided. On the third morning, I discovered that the shampoo provided, which was half-used and which I was planning to use that morning, had been removed and not replaced! Luckily I had my own to use but this was an unpleasant surprise.  The breakfast was OK but I found the choice rather limited, particularly with my egg intolerance...  On the other hand, the location is fantastic, 5min walk from Temple Meads station and the city centre, and no noise from the street bothered me at any point even though my windows faced that way.   All in all, an average stay for a high price - will choose a different hotel next time. 
0; My partner and i stayed here in january for a getaway. i got a good deal on their advanced purchase rate and booked their executive room. We checked in easily and they told us how to get to our room. Its like a maze and wouldnt be surprised if some people get lost looking for their room. The room itself was big with flat screen tv on the wall and was facing the golfing range. The bathroom had a bath with a good shower. The toiletries provided weren't great but given what i paid i didnt expect them to be. There was some award thing going on that evening but never heard any noise from it. The noise i heard was about 4.30 in the morning when the tractors went out and cleared up all the balls from the range, not that it was a bother as im often awake in the night anyway. I think there are parts of this hotel that need modernising but it was still a comfortable stay and i would stay here again. 
0;" I stayed at this hotel for my hen night and overall it was a nice hotel but there were just lots of little issues that in my opinion a 4 star hotel should not have. Our first problem was that the toilet in our room did not flush properly and sprayed loo water all over the bathroom floor. We did call reception and someone came straight out to look at it but said there wasn't a problem. We paid for the &quot;girls night out&quot; package which was a brilliant deal including a goody bag, cocktails, half a bottle of wine each and £35 each towards our meal. The cocktails were brilliant and we probably had 3 each. However, our menu choices were taken while we were drinking our cocktails so we think the food was cooked and then heated up for when we sat down in the restaurant. I had the risotto which was really dry and my friends &quot;medium&quot; steak was quite dry and looked as though it had been sat on the side for a while. The service was great for the evening meal but not so great for the breakfast. The toast was cold and the tea tasted like coffee. We had to ask for a new pot of tea and then call them back again to get us new cups.  The spa was ok but I wouldnt go there again mainly because children were allowed in the spa which is fine if you are a family wanting to use a spa but not if you are a couple or a group of friends who want to chill out. the children were often in the jacuzzi which made it difficult to use (even though under 16s arent allowed in there). the steam room could do with a nice eucalyptus scent in it as it smelt more like sweaty feet. There were also only 4 loungers which were always &quot;reserved&quot; by people dumping their towels on them - when we moved the towels so we could use them we got shouted at by a lady that was in the jacuzzi at the time and soon realised that her and her 3 friends had &quot;claimed&quot; the sun loungers and were then accused of ruining their spa day! These all seem like really tedious issues but there were quite a few of them!  On the positive side - the hotel staff were really friendly and chatty. They let us check out of the room late on Sunday so we had the rooms to chill out in. They organised a taxi for us on the Saturday night to go into the centre of Bristol which was only £20 each way.  The lady that did all of our treatments in the spa was very good and and well worth the money. The treatment rooms were lovely and I am looking forward to buying some of the espa products with my £30 voucher. One thing I will mention for the attention of the staff - I was stood by the reception in the spa when im assuming the manager had a go at one of the young men that work there as he made an error with something and it was really quite embarrassing for me as a customer to be stood there while that was going on - perhaps you could do that in an office or somewhere where there arent customers?  Overall, I had an amazing hen night and I didnt let these things spoil my weekend away but it is just something to think about if you are wanting a 4 star spa weekend. Definitely dont go if you want peace and quiet in the spa . "
0;Visited here as part of a coach trip so this hotel wasn't our personal preference. The reception area was of a 4* standard however this certainly wasn't the case with the rooms. The rooms were very dated and looked like they needed a very good clean. The skirting boards were filthy, we had hairs on our bed sheets and the back of the toilet wasn't very clean either. Could really do with and update and some tender loving care. The breakfast area and food was lovely and you wouldn't think you were in the same hotel. Another advantage was it was close to Kensington High Street and the tube station. Would visit again if some improvements were made.
0;" Stayed at this hotel for a nearby family wedding. Standard of room very disappointing for the Hilton; dated, shabby & tired so to get anything decent, need to upgrade to a refurbished room. We got a good rate because of the wedding but found bar prices etc. on the expensive side; £7 for a pot of tea & a coffee! "
0; This hotel has a true town house feel but the rooms need updated. The paintwork shows signs of age and needs redone. I found the menus unappetising but the breakfast was good. The staff were very good and apparently room 16 is haunted     biting but the breakfa 
0;" Four stars for food, two stars for service at today's Sunday brunch. The manager suggested that there were too few staff as some people had called in sick, but there were at least 6 serving staff In a fairly small space. It just seemed that they were all a little bit directionless. We waited 20 mins for drinks ( chasing them up twice), had to grab a passing waitress to order, weren't asked if we wanted any sauces with our roast dinners, weren't asked if our meals were ok, had to ask for dessert menus and then spoons when those desserts finally arrived ( by which point we were finding it all pretty hilarious).  To be fair, the very professional senior waitress took 20 percent off our bill to apologise but there shouldn't have been any need to; the food was excellent. I think perhaps the staff just need a pep talk. "
0; Stayed here many times and always found the staff brilliant, the rooms excellent and clean and so it seemed a great choice for a spa break for myself and two friends. We were on a reviver spa package. Check in was rushed, felt patronised by staff member. Another staff member told us we had been upgraded which was nice. However We were then given the wrong room number and housekeeping had to help us get in to room by phoning reception to get our actual room number. The spa itself is nice, have been before but the experience was only ok because there was not enough seating for the bookings that day. Seemed like the hotel had oversubscribed to maximise profits at the expense of the customer. Included treatment was nice but the spa staff seemed stressed and over stretched. This made for an experience that was far from relaxing. We spent most of the time in our room as no relaxation seats available. Room service was nice (we got some snacks and light lunch). Dinner wasn't good. We had a three course meal included. My friends meal was described as butternut squash risotto with goats cheese. It was just rice and stock. No other ingredients in sight. Her fault for being a veggie I would normally say but starters weren't great either. Ordered white wine which came at room temperature. Staff brought a replacement glass which was slightly colder but not much. I had finished my meal by then and didn't drink it. The staff in the restaurant were very nice but not well trained. It is important to say though that my friend asked for a cheese board instead of her meal as the rest of us where on dessert. They brought a brilliant cheese board. They also didn't charge for the wine.   In the evening we had some nice enough cocktails. The ladies loos were not maintained though and were frankly a state by 11pm. The bar is marketed as a luxury champagne bar.   You may think this review is very picky and I am but the hotel is 4 star so should be better than we experienced. Yes you get what you pay for but a 4 star hotel on this occasion, the mercure wasn't. I would stay again because I like the hotel. I stay in Sheffield a lot and I still think it's the best city centre hotel. The rooms are big and the staff usually great. I just was disappointed on this occasion and wanted to feed that back. 
0; Just back from a short leisure stay. Don't usually do feedback as one persons view can be very different from another, but felt let down by the poor service, so it has prompted me to write. Nice building, comfortable room, but the lack of communication is the let down. Had booked a prepaid package for dinner/bed breakfast. Bottle of wine to be in room and discount for Cheshire Oaks. No wine in room. Had to ask. Apparently you have to say whether you want it in room or at dinner. Opted for this at dinner. Cheshire Oaks ?. Had to ask. You have to fill a form in whilst at Cheshire Oaks and show proof of stay at Craxton Wood. Very straightforward !. Told that dinner would be served in Garden Room at end of corridor. Dutifully did this. Waited for a member of staff to appear. Apparently we were in the wrong place. Had to ask. Needed to be back in the corridor and retrace our steps to go through to what we were told was the conservatory. There are entrances to two bars off this corridor, but because of the layout, you cannot see a way through to access the conservatory. Again had to ask. By now we were feeling slightly irritated. Soon got allocated a table and order placed. Wine did not appear. Had to ask. Enjoyable starters and mains. However after 40 mins the sweet had not arrived. Had to ask. Staff had brought additional desert cutlery to the table which showed that we were waiting for our desert, but despite the lady manager walking past and noticing there was still nothing on our table, we again had to ask. The emphasis was put on seating and attending to diners who had a later sitting than us, and we ended up getting our desert at virtually the same time as surrounding tables who had been seated much later. All told it took over 2 hours to get served with the standard set menu which is unacceptable. Then the bill came for the extras, Quite happy to sign for what we had ordered, but this totalled the full cost of our meals which had been prepaid. Once again - had to ask. Apparently this would be deducted from our account. No problem with that if only they tell you these things. Once you have signed, it says you accept the costs as correct. Decent nights sleep. Next morning, on opening the door to the corridor found the suction head of a hoover halfway across the bedroom threshold. Nearly tripped over it. On making our way to the Garden room we were pleasantly surprised to see a small table had been set up on which was sign directing guests through the bars in order to obtain breakfast. Could this not have been done at dinner on the previous evening ?. Went thro to the conservatory. to be led back to a table the Garden room !. Orders taken for tea/coffe and mixed toast. Self serve for cereals. Order taken for cooked breakfast. Still no tea or toast. Other guests seated after us getting theirs. No sign of the bacon etc. Had to ask. Others guests now tucking in to the cooked brekkie. Not us !. Dining room now emptying. Every table piled high with dirty dishes. We are surrounded by them, still with our used cereal bowls in front of us. Still no food. Had to ask. Eventually it arrived. Had to move cereal bowls ourselves as no room to put down plates.Food not as ordered but we were so fed up, couldn't risk sending it away. Still no cuppa or toast. Had to ask. Eventually spotted tea and toast coming our way thro a now empty dishevelled dining room. Sorry for delay, we have been busy etc. Toast not as ordered, but by now had lost the will. It had taken and hour and twenty minutes to get his far. Totally unacceptable.  Just had time to go back to the room and pack up prior to departure at 11am. The hoover was still there. all sad and lonely, no one playing with it. Joined the queue at reception. Everyone seemed to have a query. No intention of using the express check out, wanted to ensure our account was correct. Indeed. we had been given our credit against our evening meal. but there was mysterious £1 added on. Had to ask. Apparently it is put on automatically to go to MacDonald nominated charities. Why are you not made aware of this ?. You can ask for it to be deleted. I had no problem paying this, but do not like the idea of any money being put against my account that I am not aware of, no matter how small the amount. Finally, at 11.20am I did not feel like wasting even more of my day asking to speak to the manager, nor spend time filling in the satisfaction form as this is meant to be a holiday, a chance to get out and see things, hence the trip advisor review. This place needs a radical shake up. 
0; We (as many other reviewers did) stayed here on the Travelzoo deal which included a tasting menu as well as bed and breakfast. The staff were perfectly friendly, although slighlty uninterested when we first arrived.   The room was lovely - very large, comfortable, super bathroom, and as people have mentioned, the additional touches, such as chocolates, fresh milk, fruit etc were great - so far so good.  We walked from the courtyard rooms over to the restaurant for dinner, the grounds were lovely but a little unkempt. The dining room was incredibly cramped - my husband had to squeeze into his seat by presenting his behind to the couple sat next to us, which I'm not sure was ideal for them since they were halfway through dinner. Even bny leaning accross the table and lowering our voices, there was no chance of private conversation, and when I went to use the bathroom halfway through the meal, I had to interrupt someone's dinner and ask them to move their chair so I could get out, and of course in again. There were three lovely other reception rooms, one that was not even in use, so why they couldn't have used one of these instead of cramming everyone into one room I don't know.   The service wasn't great, out waiters all had a friendly but slightly vague air about them, as if they didn't really know what they were doing. We felt like we had to guess where we should sit etc - no-one talked us through the menu, made any requests about drinks or anything that I would normally expect.  The menu looked wonderful, but was fairly bland and nothing special to eat - for example the apricot-stuffed ballotine of chicken was litterally wet chicken with chopped dried apricots, some salad and blobs of balsamic vinegar reduction. The tarte au citron was the best part of the dessert and I've had better from M & S! The wine we ordered tasted was not great - as someone else has mentioned, I could buy the same thing from Tesco for £4.  The breakfast was also very poor, and service at breakfast was bad - lots of dirty plates on tables, the food had clearly been loaded into the hottrays at the start of the service for the whole sitting as everything was lukewarm and chewy. I felt sorry for any vegetarians as the hashbrowns were on a bed of greasy bacon. We were told where the hot food was and shown to a table, the couple next to us were given menus with no explanation, and the couple the other side of us were told they could order additional hot food from the menu but not given any menus. We were given neither the menu or the option to order from it, although when I requested paoched eggs (clearly that had also been sat on a hotplate somewhere else, as they were very overcoooked) they were given to me.  Overall, I would recommend the hotel to anyone in the area, but tell them to be sure to book somewhere else for dinner! 
0; So, this was a last minute booking and was a decent value for money. My biggest concern was there was no handle on more door that led to the balcony. The door opened due to the wind and I went to close it, I realised there were no handles or safety net. A young child could easily fall so be careful . It would have been nice to receive toiletries e.g shower cap , toothbrush etc... The bar prices were decent and I guess the good thing about the hotel was the 24/7 bar. Initially I thought the location of the hotel was great but it got so noisy in the morning due to being close to the M1 and the trains that kept doing my head in! My sleep wasn't great due to this. I suggest ear plugs! 
0; This is a great location and convenient for all the central things. We were going to a wedding nearby, so it did the job. However, I wouldn't choose this for a holiday as it's nothing special and expensive if you book directly for what you get. The restaurant was nice (but limited vegetarian menu) but the decor was all very modern and looked a bit cheap. The room was large and very clean but, again, nothing out of the ordinary. There was no pool and the treadmill in the fitness room was broken. 
0; The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, but there was a lack of storage space - no drawers and not a bedside table to be seen. At 2.00 pm we had to pay £10.00 for an early check-in, which was quite upsetting - this has never happened to us before in years of travelling and staying in hotels.  In summary, this hotel is fine for somewhere to put your head down to sleep at night (the comfortable and clean bed was the best thing in the room), but do not go expecting anything more than this. I do not really think it was value for money - I am staying in a 4-star hotel in the same area for only £10.00 more per night next month.    
0; I chose this hotel because of its location right next to the US embassy which was the main reason for my trip to London. It was perfect for that reason because it is literally five seconds from the embassy. However, I wouldn't say that this hotel is deserving of it's five star status. The rooms are pretty basic and the service was not great.   When we checked in the woman on the front desk asked for a credit card to block £50 for potential damages or movie payments. I didn't like the thought of £50 being taken for no reason, especially when the room had been paid for in advance. I queried this and after a bit of back and forth she eventually said that I didn't have to make the payment.   There was only enough tea, coffee, milk etc for two people to have one cup each and when I requested more in the morning it never appeared. I also had to ask for another bath towel because the bath got completely flooded when I had a shower and I had to mop the floor up with a towel. I am still waiting for the towel and coffee.   Good location and served its purpose well but I wouldn't rush back. 
0; The hotel was just under £5 in a cab from the station but could also be walked in 10/ 15 mins and is right in the centre of lots of bars and restaurants.. The staff were very friendly and helpful and anything we asked of them, directions, a map, to order a cab was done efficiently and cheerfully. Our room overlooked a pedestrian street with several pubs on it so we had pub tables right outside our window. This was fine the first night when it was raining but on the second night when it was warm it was rather noisy from both the people and bottles being dumped into the bin by the pub. The room (132) was fitted with secondary glazing but there was one panel missing so this couldn't be closed. Premier offer a Good Night Guarantee so we could have complained and had the night free but fortunately we were both so tired we slept through it so we didn't try this. If you don't sleep well avoid these rooms. I went with friends so we had 5 rooms in total - 2 of them had aircon/heating that didn't work. Reception were able to fix one but not the other. There are also really annoying instructions for the system that show you a diagram and tell you to turn the summer winter switch. This is on the other side of the room, not on the panel shown in the diagram and we all took a while to find it. Breakfast is in the Brewers Fare Pub attached to the hotel I have stayed in many Premier Inns and this was by far the worst breakfast I have had at one. Staff were again very helpful and polite but the scrambled eggs were like cotton wool & hash browns were soggy even though the cooked breakfast was cooked to order. Instead I would recommend Che Cafe (out to main hotel and down the road to the left of the Loch Fynn Oyster Bar which is opposite).Cheaper and much much nicer breakfast. 
0;" The hotel renovations are very nice and they have quality items in their rooms! The food is amazing and the chefs clearly work very hard on their presentation and have amazing cooking skills!   Why u have titled this review the way I have is that in the greater scheme of the things, we felt it was a little over priced for a place that feels like a higher start rated premier inn. We stayed in the outer block with balconies so I am unsure how the main building would be!  We felt that it wasn't a very personal experience and that the hotel hasn't really got its priorities straight when it came to room amenities, for example they have iMac PCs in the balcony bedrooms but then no t.v, which I understand you can watch t.v on the iMac but the screen size is 22&quot; and is tied to the desk a mile away from where you are laying in bed! Also the rooms have balconies but don't be deceived if you are a smoker because the hotel includes the balconies as no smoke areas so if you are booking one of those rooms for that reason then don't! The rooms also lack bar fridges and air conditioning which is unfortunate because we arrived on a day that was nearly 30 degrees!   The last gripe we had but wasn't a huge deal was that previously to our arrival we emailed the hotel and asked if hey have room service available to which they promptly replied yes but then later on we found out that the room service has a £5 tray charge!! Considering the prices of the rooms and food you would think that they would not do that, I mean breakfast cots £17.50 per person if you don't have it included!!   Anyway I wood sum it up by saying that if you are there for business/tourist/visiting then I would think it would be ok but if you go for a nice couples night away then there are allot more personal and better hotels you could stay at for that amount of money!    "
0; Staying for London marathon. Booked specifically as apartment so we could make our own breakfast. Toaster promised on website which was needed for early breakfast. No toaster available or forthcoming. Reason - we are on the 6th floor. now cold nasty crumpets. sounds petty but this was the main reason we booked this hotel. Otherwise great location and would recommend but don't believe what you read on facilities. 
0; The actual hotel was lovely, as was my room, however it was a business trip and not everyone could say the same. The receptionist was by far the most friendly person in the hotel. Food was average, service average. Great location 
0; Check in was very smooth and we were allocated our groud floor rooms which were near the spa and convenient. Although very near the reception it wasn't too noisey. Breakfast were excellent and lots of variety. Afternoon tea was included in our package but checkin staff had not given us the necessary vouchers to use. We had to go to check in again to ask. Once we handed these to the bar staff they brough out tea for 4 of us but scones only for 2! I had to go back to the bar to ask where the scones for the rest of us were. The girl on bar seemed very inexperienced and said she had only one voucher which was not correct as she had given us 4 teas! Eventually got some cold scones with no cutlery so had to send back to get warmed. We had the same problem as other customers in that our key just stopped working. No apology or explanation was given at reception, Dinner was very good but a very large party of ladies decided to bring their own music and play it loudly during the meal. Staff should really not have allowed this as this was not a private room they had hired. But the meal and staff were excellent with dinner. (service a little slow but this was ok with us as we were pacing ourselves anyway!). Spa was very good.. but not big enough for the amount of guests there. Checkout was very bad we were given the wrong bill and over charged. Fortunately I checked this thoroughtly and advised the staff it was wrong. They amended the bill but offered no apology for their mistake. Overall hotel is ok but staff need to be more attentive and apologetic when it is their mistake. 
0; Me and my husband stayed here on the 29/1/2016 , we stayed for just 1 night before setting off on our holiday the next day . We checked into our room to find the room hadn't been cleaned properly , the toilet floor was dirty , my husband had a shower and the water was just warm , he dried himself with the towel and it ripped down the middle , the towels were worn , the bedding was worn and looked dirty , they hadn't even filled up our coffee , tea and sugar sachets and the rubbish was still there from the previous guest , we were very disappointed , they didn't even ask if we enjoyed our stay when we checked out , luxury , I don't think so ! 
0;I enjoyed my stay here. We only stayed one night but can imagine that if your were staying more than two the room may become too cosy. For the price you'd thing you would get an extra square foot to get into bed. Also the breakfast was ok.. Room for improvement. The staff were great. The hotel is decorated lovely but there is a small bar that needs some love.
0;" Stayed at the hotel for one night for my husband's birthday. I was very disappointed and felt it was overpriced. The windows in the room didn't close (which you could expect for the age of the building) but due to the fact that only one of the windows had secondary glazing, the room was very noisy. The hotel knows that some windows don't close, which is why they have the secondary glazing - ours had just been removed, so you could hear all of the noise of the street!  The service was average; not overly friendly. Pretty good quality, but not once did anyone smile!  The hotel is a very pretty, old building, set in a beautiful village and the breakfast was pleasant. The local area was lovely and I would really recommend the Great House for dinner, which is only a 3 minute walk. "
0; Disappointing sandwiches,poor quality bread. Since the super sized menu arrived, choice of paninis etc has shrunk.Waiting staff pleasant, a pity about the argumentative one.l Good seating, and cosy open fire. 
0; Have been booked into this hotel many times before when it was previously the Thistle. On this occasion, stayed in a large modern airy room on the second floor with a lovely seaview, whilst in Brighton for a Conference. The room had a large comfy bed, and a nice recently decorated bathroom. Wasn't impressed with the wifi - even though I managed to connect to it, was never able to access the Internet properly for web searches or working on emails, so had to wait until I could connect to the wifi at the nearby Conference Centre. The hotel has a good selection for breakfast. It's a nice hotel in a good location. 
0; We booked for lunch with our grown up children for our daughter's birthday meal. The setting for the meal was wonderful overlooking the estuary and most of us had tasty meals but the service was terrible. We waited 20 minutes before anyone even came to ask if we wanted a drink, another 20 minutes when we'd all finished our meals for the plates to be cleared away and then only after I told a waitress we had finished, they didn't offer us a dessert menu we had to ask for it and when asked if we enjoyed our meals, we all said yes apart from my husband whose meal wasn't good - he explained to the waitress that the meat wasn't cooked well and wasn't enjoyable and she said she'd talk to the manager about it but then we had no feedback - I would expect in a good restaurant for a gesture such as a free dessert or refund on a meal to be given but nothing happened and to cap it all a 10% gratuity was added to our bill without us having a choice - we didn't ask for it to be removed as we didn't want to cause a fuss with our children there on a special day. We just felt the staff weren't switched on - they were ambling around slowly, not making eye contact, not asking us if we were enjoying our meal or needed anything and yet the restaurant wasn't full. We won't be going there again for a meal I'm afraid even though we live really close by. Very sad. 
0; Me and my Boyfriend stayed here for one night when visiting the NIA.  It was the cheapest offer at such late notice. Really convenient for the NIA, just a bus down the road and a couple of mins walk. Lots of places to eat and clubs around.  The hotel was average, TV was good, bed comfy but room looked a tad dated - also a weird shape? But was fine for a short stay. The bath and shower worked well, also dated but didn't really matter.   The hotel was really noisy from about 6:30 in the morning, sounded like a loud hoover and you could hear other people quite easily. We had breakfast included, I had a nice croissant, but the grapefruit seemed like it was tinned. My boyfriend had an English Breakfast and said it was horrible.   The hotel was average, good for what we needed it for. 
0; On arrival hotel looked impressive but when booking in they tried to charge us again even though it had all been paid in advance for a special occasion and kept us waiting as apparently a guest had taken ill in their room, obviously not enough staff to cope. Secondly it was booked for a 50th birthday but no effort had been made to make the room (129) look special (was advised previously that the room would have chocolates and wine waiting but nothing appeared) very clean but nothing indicated it was anything other than an overnight stay. Package included a spa and manicure but the manicure was a waste of time, can do it better myself, had a French manicure and by evening the tips were all cracked and looked a mess, showed staff member when booking out who just said thats not very good. A very nice hotel and all staff friendly but would not recommend for a special occasion. 
0; We stayed for one night after travelling up on the Settle to Carlisle train for our wedding anniversary. As it was a special occasion I booked and executive room and expected something better than our last visit 2 years ago when we stayed in a basic double room which overlooked the roof of the railway station but was much nicer and seemed roomier.  Oh dear were we disappointed. The room was actually smaller but at the front of the hotel with a lovely view of the town.  The décor was tatty and the bathroom in need of updating. This review would be much better if they hadn't called the room executive and charged extra for it. This just makes you feel you've been ripped off. We didn't complain on check out as we wanted to leave our case at reception whilst we went shopping! The breakfast was as good as last time though - plenty of choice and friendly staff. 
0; After visiting The Queens Gallery for an exhibition I wanted a coffee & sandwich. This area is poorly served for anything half decent so thought I'd venture in The Rubens Hotel. Main door opened for me by doorman, shown to a nice table by charming girl, so far so good. I sat & sat & sat, eventually a very nervous young lad gave me a menu, after another long wait I ordered a smoked salmon sandwich, cappuccino & glass of tap water. Many staff came & went, no one seemed to be doing anything. Coffee came, massive cup way too big for the saucer, another long wait then the waiter realised he'd forgotten the water, eventually this was served. Someone else came into room saying bagel? Bagel? This turned out to be my sandwich. I could not be bothered to ask them to change it as it had taken so long. The food was ok, not great, coffee luke warm. Big shame as its a nice room & could be great with better staff training. 
0; We attended the wedding of our neice and because of the location of the venue decided to stay at the manor. Whilst we found the grounds, sculptures and statues very attractive it seems a shame that the same amount of detail doesn't apply to the running of the manor. Pathways are like minefields for ladies wearing heels and are in need of attention, lots of gaps and holes to get heels stuck in and twist ankles as I did. No one seemed to know which bar was open. Eventually served by the receptionist who admitted she didn't have a clue what she was doing. At least she did try. The room was pleasantly clean, although if you looked closely at decor the stairs on the way to the room in need of attention. At the reception the bar was staffed by 2 waiters which meant long delays at the bar. Whose prices were extortionate not a bottle of wine for less than £18. Lack of seating meant older people sitting in the foyer away from the wedding party. Hot drinks not obviously available. Very pushy DJ insisting that the bride and groom will get up and do their first dance even though they were trying to eat!!! It is supposed to be their day after all. On returning to our room around midnight the music was still blaring in the gardens and continued to all night long ensuring that no one had a decent nights sleep. That included the bride and groom. Also people who had an 800 mile journey to make. Several had called reception to no avail and no answer. We decided to make a drink on return to our room only to find dead flies in our cups and if that wasnt enough we were then woke by the fire alarms going off. So whilst we enjoyed attending the wedding of our neice it's such a shame we can't say the same about our stay at the manor. 
0; We used the hotel for a business meeting, not our usual but fancied a change! We should have stuck to our usual. The decor feels very worn, and although staff were accommodating, they certainly were trained to keep asking if we wanted anything so much so it felt uncomfortable. On leaving ( I hadn't drank my coffee as it was vile) the waitress asked if there was anything wrong. I told her it was, but they didn't offer any refund or apology. Certainly won't be returning 
0; Fantastic price for this hotel, it was the same for three nights as we would have paid for one anywhere else. It is also in the perfect location for tourists. All you can eat breakfasts are fab too.  However, we stayed in a family room, which are all in a separate hotel around the corner from the hotel in the pictures on the website and the one above. Even though this was the hotel we booked to stay in. In the hotel around the corner there was no air conditioning. Two fans were provided but the heat in the room was stifling, which affected our nights sleep.   With the above said, we will be back and I would recommend the hotel, but that the heat and the second hotel need to be noted. 
0; We stayed for three nights and we're delighted to be upgraded to the bridal suite. The room was very comfortable but was let down by the trickle of a shower which looked as if it would be an amazing power shower but was very disappointing. I ended up having to wash my hair in the sink which was not an easy feat! As many people have already commented the temperature of the bath water means that you do not want to linger for a luxurious soak. It's such a pity as the bathroom looks so inviting. We used the spa once but were disappointed that the sauna and jacuzzi were out of order. The pool is quite cold and the changing rooms needed some TLC. The dirty towels were overflowing and a quick tidy up was needed. It was the same story in the bar where the tables needed cleaning. We ended up cleaning our table ourselves! We asked for some crisps to accompany our drinks and were told the bar did not have any despite the people at the next table having some. It did not seem that staff were very committed to giving above average service. With a little more attention to detail this could be a good hotel but management need to be monitoring the customer experience more carefully.  
0; My partner and I attended here for a wedding, unfortunately i was not left with a good impression! The hotel and grounds are lovely, nice old hotel, however very over priced I thought. When we arrived we were greeted by a rude receptionist Terri, I asked if there was anywhere to keep my bags as check in wasn't till 3 and we arrived in a taxi. I was met with 'well check in isn't till 3, but i suppose you could keep your bags behind the desk'. So my first impression was not great! However this was soon replaced as the wedding rooms were lovely, all the staff were so helpful and worked really hard. The room was decorated lovely, really good day. Massive well done to all involved. We were given room 219, which was a little far away from the wedding room. This was no problem to us, well until later in the night when we had a few too many and got lost! The room was huge, a lot of storage space. The bathroom really let it down though, was very old fashioned and the bath had long red hairs in the bottom. Breakfast was again a let down, There were no tables ready so we were asked to sit next door and wait, no offer of a cup of tea/coffee or given any sort of time we would have to wait. Luckily another couple we were with arrive so we got a table of 4 quicker. My poached egg had a black hair embedded through it and also there was a hair on my plate, I did mention this to the staff who offered to have my breakfast replaced, I had been put off eating anything at that point so declined the offer. Not a great stay but the wedding was outstanding and I can see why people pick this venue. We got the room rate discounted with being with the wedding party, Had i have paid the £175 that the room should have been I would have been very annoyed as I definitely do not think it is worth that price. If i attend another wedding at the hotel I will look at getting a taxi home. 
0; A really handy spot for the town centre.  Parking spaces are a bit tight. Don't get confused and use the pay and display car park, the hotel's car park is just a few yards further on.  We found the Classic Room a bit compact (smaller than a Premier Inn room).  The breakfast service wasn't as friendly as other Macdonald hotels and the buffet choice was limited (less pastries and fresh fruit than others, you had to ask for Flora and Nutella for toast). Staff wearing jeans and seem to be too casual in their roles. I had the 'Les Crepes' twice and the quality was extremely inconsistent as was the cooked breakfast. 
0;" I stayed at this hotel for one night with friends on a trip to Oxford. The check-in was efficient. It is in a great location with good access to roads and a short taxi ride into the city centre. The rooms however were very cold I think this was in part because smokers were using an emergency exit at the bottom of a staircase near our rooms and leaving the door open. I closed it twice because I was concerned about the security implications of it being left wide open. I would agree with a previous reviewer that the room decor is a throw back to the 80's. I was disappointed that there was no clock in the room. The beds were comfortable (I like a hard mattress!!). One of my friends wanted to use the pool but described it as no more than a splash pool that was too crowded to use. I didn't visit the spa myself. We found the bar staff were good and efficient though we made use of the bar area at a quiet time. Unfortunately there was an awful smell of damp in the vicinity of the bar toilets which was unpleasant. The breakfast was good though completely self service, including coffee from machines. We did not feel hurried over our breakfasts and the room it was served in was clean. The worst aspect of our stay has come when I realised I had left a Kindle in the room. I rang a few hours after check out and was assured that it had been found and would be posted to me (I offered to drive back the next day to collect it myself). Since then, nothing has arrived. I have telephoned several times over four days, my calls are NEVER returned. I have been told when i have called that it has been put in a safe, that it has never been put in a safe, that it has been posted to me, that they never had it, and that it has been given to someone else who turned up to collect it!! NOT what I expect from any hotel. POST SCRIPT I received a call from the hotel today to say that my Kindle had been located and would be sent to me on Monday. I will keep my fingers crossed but won&quot;t hold my breath! "
0; used this as a legoland trip. Having booked this hotel months in advance, i was unhappy to find that the childrens room was a few doors down, especially as they had interconnecting doors in the rooms in which you can hear tho oppupants and their activities quite clearly, reception did not give you any instructions and just passed the key and grunted, Having booked bed and breakfast i asked what time breakfast was served, he told me i had booked room only so i would have to pay £8.99 per person, i showed him my booking details and at this point he became very rude and still told me i didn't, even though it was on the paper so i had to pay for breakfast, the rooms were comfortable and very clean, and cleaned daily, the tv did not work in one room but was fixed whilst we were out. There is no where to walk to but the evening meals are very expensive as they did not do a childs menu, £12.50 for burger and fries, the restaurant staff could not do enough for you at both meals, all that let it down was the very rude reception staff 
0; Stayed at Dunston Hall last night, the bathroom is disgusting, I don't think the taps have been cleaned in years! Mould all over the tiles and corners of the walls... have these people not heard of bleach?! I couldn't even bring myself to have a bath. When we woke up in the morning, there was a strong smell of sewerage in our room. For £199 a night, it's a joke! 
0; I have been to the hotel a lot as it was one of my favourite hotels locally. The spa is excellent. The food in the restaurant too is great. Second year running having Christmas dinner at the hotel.   However the afternoon tea has dropped significantly. The last two times we have been they managed to either confuse our order and then tell us we were wrong or forgot to deliver the milk etc. Poor service. When we complain to the manager we got offered a complementary cream tea and yet again they got it wrong. When I complained again they offered us another which we did not take them up on. There are better hotels locally who get this right! 
0;" The circumstances of me staying here we're not out of choice. I booked another hotel through Secret Escapes to be told that they couldn't accommodate me for the dates I specifically selected so they placed me in this hotel instead. I got upgraded to a Deluxe room on the 15th floor with breakfast included for my boyfriend and I. Good points: - Swift check in and check out  - Staff friendly - Hotel lobby and bar have a good atmosphere and appear quite grand. - Good location (close to Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate station)  - Bed comfy with nice bedding.  - Black out curtains  - Breakfast in bed optional.  However with the good comes the bad.  - It's a 4 star hotel that is quite expensive to stay in so I expect a particular standard in the rooms by means of amenities and decoration. We were upgraded to a deluxe room... I would hate to see a basic room. It was decorated in a very old fashioned manner; it needs a serious re-vamp. In a 4* I expect there to be a mini bar in the room..our fridge was empty. I do not expect a shower curtain for the shower/bath suite...not only was the shower curtain there; the shower curtain stuck to me whilst showering..gross!! The wallpaper was peeling off the wall in certain areas of the room and it did smell like a vacuum cleaner had been run around but the dust bag hadn't been cleaned out in a while!  - The TV wasn't working when we arrived in the room which again doesn't impress me however staff fixed it quickly. - The hotel obviously knew that I was a disgruntled customer of Secret Escapes and that this wasn't my initial hotel choice so they tried to butter me up a bit. I heard the door go and my boyfriend answered to find a free large bottle of water and two pears with compliments!!! Now not to sound ungrateful but that's a bit poor as a complimentary offer!! - Our breakfast was included in the price we paid but it's £23 for continental and £25 for a cooked breakfast. We had it delivered to our room and it was ok..edible but just not worth that money I don't think.  - Hallway is quite noisy and could hear people walking around.  It was an ok stay for 1 night but I've stayed in a lot better for a cheaper price. You are paying for the location but not the standard of the hotel. It's a 3* standard however because of the location they can get away with calling themselves 4*! "
0; Booked the Feathers after being recommended by my brother-in-law as a peaceful and relaxing place to celebrate our wedding anniversary, well we weren't disappointed, we found the market square very pretty especially with all the Christmas decorations up in the square and in all the shops, the pub was cosy and very lively on our second night which was our anniversary so a cosy meal in a little corner was out of the question even though we had booked for dinner we were sat at a table in the bar area which was crowded so we were a bit uncomfortable being the only ones actually eating while everybody around us were only having drinks, that aside the food on both day's,breakfast and dinner were lovely, the staff were friendly but only spoke to you if you asked them anything, the blonde lady receptionist (sorry we don't know her name) was extremely welcoming and very, very friendly, overall we had a pleasant stay. 
0; Booked this for my partners birthday. One night package. We were left to our own devices. No one explained anything to us. We didn't know we had to book for lunch so had to miss this due to clashes with treatments but the worst thing about our stay was room 312. Stuffy, tired, hot and extremely uncomfortable. I managed two hours sleep before my back felt like it was beginning to crumble. I appreciate the rooms are being refurbished but just not good enough. Email communication prior to visit was pretty poor too. Treatments and spa are lovely though as was food. Overall a very odd experience sorely let down by the accommodation. 
0; So, I chose this hotel for the convenience and promises of an excellent experience. Firstly we arrived and ended up going down the delivery underground parking - stressful! All because the website states there is underground parking under the hotel but it doesn't specify that it is actually the Ibis hotel shared parking! Staff were all vague and we got different information from each person we spoke to, which was different from the website and different from the information book in the room. After being told that the car parking was free until 6 and then you pay for 24 hours for a discount, then it was £30, then it was £25 and £20 in the book... We weren't told we're meant to pre pay for breakfast at reception then take the vouchers down, so we didn't get the discounted £12 offer but were told it should be £16.95. Luckily for us as it wasn't our fault the guy in the breakfast room didn't charge us, he was the most helpful person in the whole hotel! The rooms ARE spacey and the bed was comfy. However you get one tea bag each (unless you like all the floral weird ones). The door to the bathroom has a lock on it....which doesn't lock because the door is too small for the frame. So we had to put the bin there to stop it from swinging open. And the shower blocked up and overflowed. It was also advertised as being 'very quiet', but between the woman next door constantly shouting and the sound of the generators/pipes all through the night it is anything but. Wouldn't stay here again, not at that price and promise. 
0; Came here at weekend for a surprise treat for my daughters birthday. We rang ahead and informed hotel that this was for a special occasion and arranged for some teddy bears to be put in the room on arrival. However at check in when I checked this out, I was told that the Bears had sold out. My daughter was not once wished a happy birthday which felt a bit flat. The location of the hotel is a huge bonus, the theme park is right next to it which my daughters loved.   However, the hotel itself was average rather than amazing. The hotel advertised children's entertainment from 6.30 - 8pm, however in reality this was just lots of kids thrown in a refurbished bedroom with some arts & music blaring. It was crowded and not great.  Our room was nice, however wifi wouldn't connect - not a big deal, but would have been handy and our air con was on constant cool, we could not switch it to heat, despite contacting reception twice. This was not great for late October with 2 young children.   
0; Smooth check in, friendly staff, room tiny and bathroom a significant challenge. Room clean but did have lots of dust from air managment system. Didnt eat in the hotel but the bar and restaurant were always busy and looked nice. Great lcoation for walking to Oxford Street and Camden town but disappointing for meals and refreshements which were not obviously on the door step. Great Portand Street underground across the road but this isnt the best for travelling to and from major attractions. Kings cross an easy 20 minute walk taxi took longer due to the traffic and cost around £8. 
0; Was a bit confused with the WiFi, whether it was just available to Hilton Hhonors customers because it did not work for my party. The room was supposed to be soundproof however I don't know if this meant other guests are unable to hear noise from inside my room or I am unable to hear noise from my room. However as we were at Gatwick there was a lot of noise from aeroplanes and I could also hear people in the adjacent room so I would dispute that this room is 'soundproof'. The corridor leading to the room had a prominent smell of smoke even though we were in a smoke free hotel room, I do actually consider that smoking in hotels is a thing of the past. Dining at the restaurant we found the food was very overpriced considering the quality of the food and the service, having wished we had dined at the McDonald's across the road instead. Positively, the hotel is well located with an entrance to Gatwick from the hotel without having to go outside. Well presented, clean, good service, quite expensive but because of the location, that is predicted. 
0;Chose this hotel on location and price, reviews looked ok. Location perfect and parking very convenient but pricey at £15 per night (especially when its not guaranteed parking).  We booked a standard double including breakfast for 2 nights. The room was small (but we knew that) but clean and overlooked Picadilly gardens so was pleased with that. Bed very comfortable, small flat screen tv, and all the usual amenities as expected. Unfortunately we didnt get housekeeping at all over our 2 night stay, so we had to call reception for more tea bags for the next morning (only 2 were supplied for our first night), we were immediately sent up a large selection of milks, teas, coffees etc. We told reception at check out and she asked us if we'd left the do not disturb sign on the door .... er no, if we had we wouldnt have expected house keeping. So beds not made, no replenished toilet rolls etc.  The breakfast changed on the friday morning to the saturday morning. They have an extended breakfast menu Monday-Friday which includes made to order dishes, this service is not offered on a saturday, but the overnight charge is more, I appreciate the hotel may be busier of a weekend but for a more expensive stay the same service should be offered. We ate at the restaurant on the first evening, please see separate review for Brasserie (not impressed).  
0; I stayed for 1 night.when I checked in I asked again for a quiet room.i had already e mailed this request in advance. I was told that an upgrade would be extra, and as I wanted a nights sleep I paid up. The room was on floor 12.yes it was quiet but certainly nothing special. There was a nice partial view of the park.the room itself was quite small.THere wasa bathrobe provided but no slippers, the bed was large and comfortable and I slept well.There was an iron and safe provided, but not much hanging space in the wardrobe.This was not a problem for me as I was only there for1 night.The bathroom was tiny and when I sat on the loo I hit my head on a glass shelf opposite the loo.There was barely any room to move and I am not fat, but I am fairly tall. The toiletries were adequate but nothing special, but the biscuits provided on thr teatray were good the buffet breakfast, however, was excellent. I have not stayed in a hotel for a while that served decent wmushrooms . everything was presented well and I thought that it was good value.The staff overall were friendly and efficient.I probably will not return though as I have had better deals elsewhere. 
0;A friend and I stayed here for 2 nights at the end of July and whilst the hotel building, decor and cleanliness cannot be faulted, some of the staff however, could do with going on a refresher course in customer care. One of the receptionists was mimimilistic in pleasantness and friendliness, and the attitude was clearly of indifference. The waitress who served us in the restaurant in the evening, I don't think cracked a smile all evening. The food, although I enjoyed it very much, wasn't excellent and not value for money. When we had issues in our room with the tea we had ordered, rather than just changing it for us, we were telephoned twice by staff arguing with us in a very condescending manner. That said the 2 receptionists on duty the moring we checked out (1st August), could not have been more pleasant and if all the staff took a leaf out of their books, we would have happily paid the 10% service charge, which we chose not to.  A very nice hotel, but let down by some members of staff.
0;" Situated about 5 minutes walk from Leeds railway station this hotel is a great location for all attractions in Leeds city centre. It is built in an area that has been redeveloped and is amongst some apartments and a selection of restaurants. Access could be a bit difficult at night as you have to walk through an area called the &quot;dark arches&quot; which is a series of railway arches that now form part of a car park . It was busy enough during the day but I would not be so keen late at night or alone . My advice would be to take a taxi if you arrive late . The hotel reception staff were very nice but I was disappointed with the rooms . They were very boring , decorated in white and beige. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and the bathroom had a big shower in it but no bath . There was nothing in the room that invited you to stay in and relax . I suppose it was functional . We had a drink in the sky bar but on a Saturday night this was very busy and due to the fact that there were a lot of cocktails being produced service was slow. Having said that the drinks were very good. There was a nice balcony area with heaters that meant we could escape the din of the very busy bar . My room rate was without breakfast and was £149 for a night for a double room . Good location , clean but uninspiring rooms . "
0; The place is starting to look a bit tired & in need of a face lift. Breakfast & lunch is good but evening meal not brilliant. Our room was OK, very comfy bed. Staff overall friendly. Tea or coffee with lunch would be good but you have to order this from the cafe bar & pay for it. The treatments let this spa down. My back massage was nothing more than a light back rub, totally ineffective & not relaxing at all. Very overpriced treatments too for what seems to be in the main young, straight out of college staff. My friends experience was pretty much the same as mine. Beautiful surroundings with lovely walks. Not enough quiet, warm relaxing areas so spent more time than we would have chosen in our rooms. Not impressed with the spiritualist talk, surprised that Champneys would entertain a charlatan like this who was keen on taking your money in exchange for guilt. 
0;" My mum and I stayed at Forest Mere for 2 nights at the end of January this year. My mum has previously been to the other Champney resorts but never this one. I had never been so wasn't sure what to expect. The actual hotel was in a lovely setting and even more beautiful when we arrived as it had been snowing heavily. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite from a superior as we had mentioned it was my birthday and mums 4th visit to a champneys resort. The room was lovely; nice big tv, lovely L-shaped sofas and comfy beds with a nice walk in shower. Unfortunately the shower was cold on the first night but as soon as mentioned the staff got about fixing it and it was fine the next morning. The restuarants were nice. The main 'cafe' diner in the middle of the hotel was very nice and had a relaxing atmosphere and was warm. The food was lovely. However, the main resturant that we ate at in the evening was cold with no atmosphere and the decor was very outdated. There was one last restuarant over looking the river which was all glass pannelled so you could see out. That had a lovely atmosphere for breakfast and dinner and I had a fantastic beef with terriaki sauce dish with noodles, delicious! Lastly onto the classes. The classes were fantastic although for a relaxing weekend you did find yourself running around alot as you had to book the classes in advance on the day you wanted to do them. You had to make sure you were up in time to book!!!! One morning we got up extra early to do a dance class. When we got down to the class the woman running it obviously thought she owned the place by the way she was swanning around telling people what to do. She was just a dance teacher from the local dance school in Liphook but she had an awful attitude about her. As I went to walk into the class she told me I had to wear trainers otherwise I couldnt come in. We were not told that trainers were needed and a few other ladies also had bare feet. I quickly ran back to the room to collect my trainers (took me a total of about 2 minutes) as I came back to the class she had locked the door on me and refused to let me in even though she had watched me go and get my trainers!!!! my mum who was already in the class said that is my daughter please could you let her in? and the rudeness this woman showed was unreal!! My mum got her stuff and left the class. We were fuming! For a start it is supposed to be a RELAXING break where everything is easy going and you come and go to classes as you please. Secondly, no one told us trainers were needed and thirdly we had rushed around to get to it! Not impressed. Instead we went to the pool. The pool was also a let down as it is heated and the temperature dial said it was 30c. It was freezing!! There were a lot of complaints about the pool to staff and I think they realised that. Finally, the eyebrow threading and massage treatments I had were fantastic and very relaxing. Very lovely girls and staff that do the treatments and make you feel at home. I did fall asleep during my back massage it was that good! We also had thalasotherapy which was very good! Never had it done before and the pool was good fun!  Overall, it was a nice weekend away but as my mum said, she would much rather go to Henlow or Tring next time.  P.S. Zoe on reception was lovely and very helpful when we arrived and departed :)  Jasmine "
0; yes we liked this hotel - it was comfortable and the food was very nice  We used it for a city break and it was perfect for that  reception staff were very nice and the parking was quite easy too we had a nice time 
0;My husband and I had a 3 night new year break at The Tankersley Manor hotel and on the whole it was a good stay. However, our bedroom was in the annex, which you accessed by being directed outside and across a path. This was fine in daylight but after a meal in the restaurant on our first night, the lighting was so poor that I tripped on a step (no I wasn't drunk), I hurt my knee but worst of all I hit my cheekbone on the path. My husband took me back to the room and reported the incident and asked for first aid. Two people arrived with a poor first aid kit, I asked for an ice pack for my face and they had to send across for one. The accident form wasn't completed but I was asked to sign it. As a first aided myself I know you shouldn't offer drinks to a casualty, but my husband and I were offered an alcoholic drink. That was the last I heard. On my return I wrote to the hotel and was contacted by one of the managers who admitted the outside light were not working, but they would be replaced, that the first aid was inadequate and apologised. I asked for a letter confirming our conversation and although this was promised I'm still waiting. At the very least I would have expected flowers, but nothing arrived.  If you stay at this hotel and have a bedroom in the annexe, insist on going back to your room via the door in the restaurant, to avoid having an accident like I did. The hotels safety issues need revising and they could benefit from PR training
0; My husband and I treated ourselves to a night away from this Kids. My husband had seen the offer on Grounpon so bought us the deal. Glad it was a deal and we didn't pay full price. We stayed in the New 'Annex' which was ok or a hotel room (Very Travel Lodge looking) and the TV seem to be a token entertainment as it was so small that seeing it from the bed was almost impossible. The room was clean to a degree but there were a few bits that needed looking at (Toilet bowl for one could have done with a good Bleach and scrub)!  We decided to go to the Bar for a drink and was most disappointed at the bar area, I waited for at least 10mins before someone came to serve me. We really wanted somewhere to chill and read our papers while we had a drink but instead we sat on the only 'Sofa' in amongst the paraphernalia of Pool tables other games table and a big screen with the Rugby on. It felt like more of a Sports Bar than a Hotel bar/lounge area.   We had dinner at 7.30pm the room was nice but very cold and again full of stuff hanging on the walls and the celling which didn't really make any sense as décor goes!!!! We were sat by the radio which we had to turn down as we were trying to talk over it. Starter of Goats Cheese on a Beetroot salad was very bland, it felt like it was make first thing in the morning and had been waiting in the fridge all day to be served. Chicken and Leek Pie was very nice but nothing special. Salmon fish cake was very nice and very filling. need to pay for extras at 3.50 per serving so needed to order a couple of bowls of bits to make the dinner a actual dinner. Sticky Toffee Pudding and Chocolate Brownie for dessert again nice but nothing special.    The waitress' although very pleasant were wearing blue and white striped Aprons I think this was suppose to represent a 'Marco' the Chief look but they did not carry this off well, it just made them look like they were working in the local Café 'Cooking and Serving' also the waitress was the Receptionist that Checked us in which we thought was a little odd.  As we already knew the Bar Area was not worth sitting in we just ended up going back to our room.  Breakfast was Hot and tasty definitely the best part of the stay (although it was a bit odd that the Juice and Cereal were on trollies in the Hallway) 
0; room was basic, appeared clean but on closer inspection bathroom could have done with a deep clean. staff very friendly and helpful. would not recommend for a longer stay unless playing golf. food was good. 
0; This is a very comfy hotel, but somehow you feel you shouldn't really be here... The Reception desk is so tall it obscures the person behind it... when there is one... and you just get the impression that no one really expects you around here... maybe this hotel isn't for the likes of you... but as there doesn't appear to be anyone else here this seems a little odd... No bar, as mentioned elsewhere, and very abrupt welcome. But breakfast very good. 
0; After visiting many hotels in York this is truly a mixed bag first impressions good then you look deeper, the restaurant is very cramped and have far to many tables too close together this was quite akward when people got up to go past your table I. E their bottom was I. Your face, the food was nice except the very over priced very small piece of over cooked monk fish which came with 4 charred shallots with stalks on and a very tiny piece of pured peas for 22.95 This was truly dissapointING.   We were away most of the night with rain constantly dripping from the gutter tap tap for hours, I also heard another couple at breakfast say the same, I did tell the chap on reception who shrugged...  Please get your act together before you get a bad reputation for not caring for your customers as business is precious. 
0; The hotel and staff were generally very nice, though we had a few issues. After being assured our check in was guaranteed from 3pm, we arrived at 3:30 to be told our room still wasn't ready. The receptionist was very apologetic and offered us complementary drinks in the bar. The room itself was mostly nice, if rather on the warm side. However, the carpet had clearly not been hoovered, as there were some chocolate sweets and whatnot lying on the floor, and we then discovered a pair of pants under one of the chairs, which was rather a surprise. We received no apology for this when reported to reception, and while the pants were removed, the sweets and other bits were still there when we returned. Suspect less care and attention was given as we were only in a 'classic' room.   The breakfast was good, though we had to wait around 5 minutes for a table. The bar was very nice with pleasant staff, and would highly recommend the hotel spa, which was excellent.  Despite the issues, we did have a nice stay and would probably go back. 
0; This hotel has such huge potential and is situated in a wonderful setting too, but first impressions are marred by an extremely pot-holed driveway I'm afraid. We booked a superior double, it was not bad, but in many hotels would pass as a standard room. Like one of the previous reviewers we appeared to be set in the side of a hill and a foot path went past both our windows. The room itself was newly decorated but actually felt damp as if it hadn't been used for soon time? The bathroom evidently hadn't had any work done with old appliances and dirty-looking grouting. The shower was not really usable, but the bath was ok AND the water was hot! Dinner was nice but again the portions were ridiculously small, with no potatoes at all! I felt that when ordering the 3 course meal for £25 portion size must be smaller? The staff were great though. Would I go again though? Probably not I'm afraid. 
0; Although this is a 4-star hotel, the breakfast is definitely not. Had better in a Premier Inn. Also one of the Duty Managers is very unprofessional, off-hand and doesn't know how to speak to customers. 
0; Booked this hotel because of Spa and found that there was only one treatment room, that is not a Spa in my book. The food was OK but the menu did not change at all during my stay. All in all a very average hotel, certainly not luxury as the name implies. 
0; Stayed for a couple of nights with some friends for my first ever trip to the Lake District - blimey can it rain there! For this reason the spa is a lovely diversion from the rain, endless walking and then more rain. Whilst the rooms were nice there wasn't really anywhere for you to leave wet or muddy clothes and although the room inside was nicely decorated and comfy, ours had a poor view. Overall the staff were nice just ineffiecent upon check in when they let us check in, then watched us lug all of our luggage from the car into reception only to then tell us that we needed to get back in the car and drive around to another block where our room entrance was - not the greatest of starts! Breakfast had good food but the service was hard work as they were super busy but by the evening the ambiance and the service is far better and the food was really nice [think everyone goes to bed early]. Apparently its a great location [accorrding to all of my walking friends] but there was also a couple of nice pubs within a reasonable distance - just to break up the endless fields and hills! 
0;stayed at the Brooklands hotel 10/08/13 booked on a Groupon deal, I was not impressed when booking had to go though a long procedure on line to book even though I had a Groupon voucher, to get Hotel comfirmation of booking, when I arrived to the hotel I showed comfirmation, this was not good enough, I was asked for Groupon voucher which I did not have, Hotel comfirmation had the Groupon deal on it and how much was paid.  The hotel receptionist would only check us in after taking another 149 pound payment. After going on line and proving I had already paid, and standing my ground I was given a refund, The booking was for one night, the time spent sorting this out spoilt my stay, customer service is poor.
0; This was a good stay. I liked the warm cookie on arrival....BUT....the room had a strange musty smell and the hotel was exceptionally cold. It was a cold winter weekend but i would expect the hotel to manage to keep residents warm. The breakfast was good and the cocktails were nice. Staff were very friendly and helpful. It would be 4 but the cold and the smell put a slight dampener on it. The room was a good size. 
0; We were moved here by the sister hotel who totally assured me that this hotel was of the same quality. The service however was some of the worst I have experienced. There are no lifts due to age of the building, so therefore you have to ask for help with cases as valet's are not on hand or easily visible  The bar was tiny and messy. We had to correct the receptionist on the late check out that had been agreed.  But worst was the fact that the next morning at 5:30am, we could over hear an all-mighty row going on and the doors on our floor were so noisey just from being opened and shut (not slammed either)  The soud-proofing as really not to standard and nor is the breakfast. We had over a 1/2 hour wait for food and so did many other tables - therefore, if you cannot service your guests properly, then make provisions for the food to be in buffet format  Overall a very disappointing stay which left me rueing the fact that I agreed to move hotel. I did get my taxi's paid for though as a gesture and a small discount, but the small discount did not make it worth all the hassle that it brought 
0; Beautiful hotel in a great location. I can't fault the decor but it was some of the basics that let the experience down for me, considering the money. Little things included, cheap toilet paper, no bottle opener in room so I had to call reception to get one delivered, 10 mins late on my wake up call, housekeeping coming to clean my room at 8am (and walking in - but least that woke me up!) 
0; Went to an arranged dance week-end, the hotel itself is very large and needs alot of TLC. One or two of the staff are positively charming (the restaurant manager is lovely) but the majority of the staff are unhelpful and in some cases downright rude. Our room had a terrible smell as soon as you opened the door and it had a large damp patch where the wallpaper was coming off. You have to pay to use the swimming pool, the drinks in the dance hall bar are very expensive and it cost £5 for two teas! The floorboards in parts of the hotel are very noisy if you are near the ballrooms then god help you with the noise. I would not stay there again but on a plus side, the food was very good, and as we were in a party of eight, there was something for all of us. 
0; Stayed here for 1 night. Would Defiantly choose someone else to stay next time.  Their car park is a 5 min walk away.  Checked on the Friday afternoon - to 2 trainee's who were not too sure what they were doing - with no extra help. Took us around 10 minutes to check in as they couldn't find our reservation.   We were on the 6th floor - got into our spacious room, the room smelt like it has previously been a smokers room. Two single beds - when we requested a double bed. they were hard, low & lumpy. No comfortable at all.  Seemed to be able to hear everything from the corridor too.  Our check out was 12noon. Before that time, we had 2 knocks on the door to see if we had checked out - I've never had this at any hotel I've stayed in before. Not professional in my opinion.  The only plus was the location of the hotel. Great central location near most things.   Would choose not to stay here again. 
0; Nice staff allowing to check in early. The room was poorly equiped for an expensive hotel, no coffemachine, limited teabags, no robe or slippers, no amplification mirror in bathroom and poor lighting, breakfast was not served with table nor a separate table in room except desk (full of work and computers) and very expensive internet charge. The location is fantastic and the room was quiet so if you only want to sleep there and leave it is ok. It is not a nice room to sit and work in between meetings and to try and dress up in the evening. 
0; We enjoyed a 1 Night Package - includes DBB & lunch plus 2x 25min Mini Treatments  The check in was quick and easy and the room was spacious and very clean – well stocked with towels and was very warm and welcoming!  The Spa was small but very nice! The changing room was a bit untidy and very cold but the pool was warm and just the right depth.  We each had a back, neck and shoulder massage and an express facial as part of the spa package. This was wonderfully relaxing!  The restaurant had a good menu, nice atmosphere and nice staff.  All in all a good/ok stay!  The only downside is the staff do not communicate anything to you. Sadly due to this we missed lunch and felt a bit like confused buffoons! We were not told information – times for lunch dinner, breakfast or check out time We were not given robes or towels for the spa and additional treatments were not offered!  The £26 allowance was not explained to us so we didn’t realise drink weren’t included until check out!   Only receptionist seemed to wanted to answer gest questions, the other (short – red spiky purple/red hair – Female) dismissed me quite a few times   The room and hotel is lovely … just a bit more guest information and front of house attention would be nice! 
0;" I can not believe what just happened to me today .. they said that my reservation &quot;my stay&quot; was paid once and that was when I first arrived but when I did the check out today they requested me to pay again and when I called my bank they said that I have paid the same amount twice .. I'm really upset because my bank account is overdrawn now and I am a student and I do not want that to happened to me .. I got disappointed even more when they said that they can not help out "
0;" well,,,, i read some of the reviews AFTER i had booked this deal and quite frankly i was worried however the room we had ( room 2 )on the front was good with lovely clean linen and a little kichenette arangment in a cupboard,the bathroom was very small but the note on the door explained that as it is a grade 2 listed building no wall can be knocked down so they have to work with what they have got.room was a bit fussy with far too much furniture in it but very comfortable. callie who checked us in was very polite and friendly and the breakfasts were lovely,well cooked and well presented,but&quot;&quot; dinner&quot;&quot; on the first night which was part of the package deal was poor.not a 3 course but a basic main course with extra to pay for a starter and dessert, thats not what i would call&quot;&quot; dinner on the first night&quot;&quot; and other reviewers are right the floor in the dining room is a skating rink for anyone in heels,i would think it is a &quot;health and safety issue,.. but overall it was a good value for money break and right on the seafront opposite the pier. i would certainly stay there again and for anyone looking for a well situated bargain break hotel it is ideal. but remember it says 4 star but i would say it was a 3 star "
2;We went here for one night's stay and thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the hospitality. The wine list is varied but we could only purchase champagne by the glass. The menu in the restaurant offered a nice variety of dishes which were very yummy. Breakfast was even nicer and very welcome before a walk in the extensive grounds.  The hotel is situated in beautiful grounds. If you forget your wellies there are some to use if they fit. The bedrooms are well appointed and large. They are also lovely and warm offering water, coffee, and soft drinks.  We enjoyed our stay here which was a celebratory one but you could go and just enjoy lunch or evening meal. Their website is easy to use and a good way to check the price.
2; We arrived and were welcomed at the front door, our coats were taken to the cloakroom for us and we were shown to the champagne reception which was very nice. The 'Suspects' were mingling at the reception and were in character.(Some did make a few 'sharp' comments which one of my party did not particularly like) But maybe that was just the acting. The meal was very good as was the wine and the service. Courses were intermingled with events. The whole evening was most enjoyable and the Hotel was decorated so beautifully for Christmas/ New Year. We did not stay over, so cannot comment on the rooms etc, but what I saw of the hotel I thought was very good and I'd go to another event like this. in fact there's one in May ..I'll book it! 
2; WE had an uncomfortable bed on our last stay and Sue the Manager ensured that our room was personally checked this time, we had a lovely comfortable stay this time and her attention to details was appreciated. We had our favourite waitress Larisa serve us in the restaurant for dinner, Her wine knowledge is always appreciated and it was lovely to return to a nice smiley face. Food was excellent and good nights sleep before we fley to Cyprus early next morning. We will be returning over and over again. 
2; We use this hotel when we are visiting relatives in Grimsby,we find it conveniently situated to the area we need to be in. Can't praise this hotel enough ,the staff are friendly and efficient .The hotel is warm very clean and inviting,the rooms are comfortable and well appointed. We did try another hotel in the area but decided that The Humber Royal offered the best all round service and value for money. 
2; All in all a great hotel. Staff were helpfully and nice. Rooms are clean and comfy with nice fittings. Breakfast was really nice and plentiful. Only grumble was we booked direct with hotel and was promised a glass of bubbly and canopays on arrival. These were not offered and I didn't see why we should have to ask! 
2; No 5 is a generously sized room, with an enormous bathroom. Undoubtedly it's a hotel that needs a little updating but I can assure future guests that our room was clean, with a large and extremely comfortable bed and pristine white linen. There is also tea making facilities in the room. The staff were very accommodating and it was no problem for them to organize our taxi to and from Glyndebourne. The cost of the room was £200. 
2; Found this Inn had much more about it than I expected. The Sunday lunch was tasty, good value and served impeccably. The roast beef was particularly good.The starters were innovative.  We shall return. 
2; Lovely location very clean toilet flush wasn't great it kept not going down and the prices of the food and drink were not prices so we are out every time but was a great stay I would recommend it 
2; We stayed at Holbeck Ghyll for my husband's 30 birthday. We were greeted by a lovely lady on reception who was so welcoming and helpful she really is a credit to the hotel.  Upon entering our room we were delighted with the most spectacular view of the lake. The room itself was nice but could probably do with a little TLC. Just a few upgrades would make it amazing... New wallpaper, the TV wall mounted.There's some beautiful features to the room like a stunning fireplace and gorgeous bathroom door with glass. The bathroom itself was really pretty. Similarly, the new doors and entrance to the room were very nice.  We had dinner in the restaurant on the evening and it was amazing. The service is 2nd to none! The night before we had dined in a Michelin starred restaurant and this was definitely on a parr. Really delicious, amazing presentation and attentive staff. The following morning breakfast was good and we visited the spa. I had booked treatments in advance. They were really relaxing treatments and the staff again were fantastic. Slightly disappointed as I wouldn't describe the spa setting itself as 'luxurious' and like the bedroom just a few finishing touches would add a lot. I also noticed I was massaged with basic physio oil rather than the premium spa aromatherapy products that were on display. It's small things like this that would make a big difference to the overall impression of the hotel. I still would recommend a visit to the spa as I really enjoyed my treatment. We had a fantastic stay here I would definitely recommend and return. This is a great 4* hotel that could easily be even better. 
2;This is real quirky hotel full of interesting but unusual features. Ideally located for London shopping.  The rooms are small but that is the way the place is designed. Although the beds are all king size so no scrimping there.  We stayed for two nights which was ideal but if your stay is any longer than a few nights you might begin to feel a little hemmed in.  Room features are very up to date to include an iPad which controls heating, lighting, tv and blinds plus more.  We paid for breakfast which was lovely and good choice. Food was hot which is unusual for a Buffett style breakfast.  Nice cocktails available too.  Well worth a visit but those who are not tech savvy may struggle.
2; I stayed with a group of friends on a weekend break. Although some of the rooms are due for refurbishment they are very clean and pleasant. We found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The bar staff lent us some glasses so we could drink our own champagne in our rooms. We ate in the hotel one of the nights as part of the deal. The food was lovely and the the waiting staff friendly. There was great selection at breakfast. A bit noisy at night but it is right on the front so it was expected. 
2;My teenage daughter and I stayed in a twin room for one night. The hotel was easy to find and parking readily available and free. Reception staff were helpful, the room was comfortable and quiet and it was lovely to have a swim and sauna before going for our evening meal in the bar. There was a good choice of dinner and breakfast options (not cheap but not expensive either compared with other hotels) and the waiting staff at meals were attentive. Express checkout was very easy. No complaints - a pleasant stay and we would happily stay again at The Noke.
2; I attended a Christmas party at this hotel yesterday and was very impressed. The package included a drink on arrival, a 3 course meal, chocolate fountain and a DJ for dancing it all off afterwards :-) The food was cooked perfectly and was hot which is rare for large events.  I have also been to this hotel several times for spa days and a friend's wedding. I would recommend it to my friends and family. It's also worth noting that the wedding package is excellent and organised by a very professional and experienced conference Manager - Rachael Bosworth. 
2; Jen and Sid gave us a warm welcome. Food was excellent. Room clean and tidy and well stocked. 
2; Took my husband to this hotel for a night away, booked through late rooms so got a good price. Our room on the fourth floor had a full sea view, which made up for the tired bedroom decor! The reception and breakfast staff were friendly and helpful. We used all the hotel facilities on the Saturday afternoon- the jacuzzi and steam room are both a good size. The reception staff recommended an Italian restaurant for Saturday night - which was nice. Walking along the sea front is so easy from this hotel! 
2; Second time that we checked-in this hotel (Mid-August and end of September) - love it and always nice swift checking at the Reception. This time we were on 5th floor and the view was superb from the window. I am surprised that there were no flannels in the bathroom, nor bins in the bedroom. Nice toiletries though. 
2; This hotel was in a Good location. Beds were comfortable. Rooms clean and tidy. Staff was helpful. Only negatives bathroom shower was on the small side and only glass sliding door so not that private. Not a great view either. 
2; Stayed on a Sunday night, on the wine and dine package. The room was small, but very nice, clean and had everything we needed. We used the spa facilities that provided everything you could expect. We did eat in the restaurant, I really enjoyed my meal, but my husband was a little disappointed with quality and taste. The wine in our room was very nice, it would be nice to have the option of having the bottle with the meal. All the staff without exception were friendly, helpful and professional. I would consider staying here again in the future. 
2; The location of this hotel is excellent as it is right opposite Marylebone tube station and there are good local amenities such as cafes and a local Tesco store. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful receptionist Francesca and a very polite trainee Nana. They both made us feel welcome and were eager to answer our questions. They gave us a hair dryer and their own tea bag which was very kind. All the rooms have been recently refurbished, the beds are a lot comfier. There were good facilities in the room such as a TV, tea and coffee making facilities and also a fan which came in very handy as it was quite warm. The bathroom was a bit small and it would have been helpful to have a bedside cabinet. Also there wasn't any complimentary shampoo or shower gels which would have been useful.The security at the hotel was excellent. 
2; Stayed for three nights, rooms a good size - stayed in a family room which had a double bed and a single bed (which wasn't required) so bit tight for the cot but was absolutely fine. All the staff were really pleasant and friendly. Lovely bar area which is reasonably priced and the food is good.  We would stay here again! 
2; We stayed at the hotel friday march 27th, clean room, tasty food at the outsidein reataurant, we also ate breakfast here which was delicious. Staff were attentive and friendly, it was a relaxing stay, weve been once before n will definitely be coming again 
2;" Stayed here before and this stay was just as good as previous visits. The only slight problem we had was, unfortunately we were not given the map for our &quot;escape&quot; route in & out on NYE once the firework barriers were erected. This is obviously a one off. Room was newly refurbed and very comfortable. "
2;I booked to stay at Dunston Hall through a third party company for a spa break with seven friends. Our 'deal' included dinner, bed, breakfast and a spa treatment. I was slightly dubious that as we had booked a package deal the food, accomodation and treatment wouldn't be up to standard, but I was wrong..  The hotel is very grand and set in beautiful grounds. Our room was large and well appointed. The spa treatment (aromatherapy massage) was one of the best I have had and the quality of the food was very good both at dinner and breakfast.  The only critcism I could make would be that the pool area and our room were a bit tired, and probably on the list for decoration/renovation, as it was obvious that this had already taken place in other parts of the hotel.  We had a very relaxing, stress free girlie weekend but this would also be a lovely venue for a romantic break away.
2; Stayed here last night, had a generally good stay. Room looked impressive enough, great city views and great location. We ate dinner in the restaurant and, whilst my food was very enjoyable, my husband wasn't overly impressed saying his food was quite tasteless.  However, regarding our stay my main complaints were that the bed was totally uncomfortable, far too firm and my shower had no hot water at all. Disappointing really. 
2;Stayed here one night for business and really impressed. Just a few minutes walk from Albert Dock and not much further to the city centre. Plenty of parking, spacious room and really comfy bed and pillows. Good shower too and great choices at breakfast. Staff were really friendly too. Ask for a view of the Mersey though, rather than looking at the road on the other side!
2; We stayed on a Secret Escapes deal and had an excellent stay. Our room in the main house was excellent, with massive walk in shower and good bathroom amenities. Three course dinner with just large steak restrictions ( given we were on a deal) with generous portion sizes, was well cooked. Staff very pleasant. 
2;Second time at this hotel. The rooms are spotless and one of the greatest assets are the great staff. Only 4 stars not the fault of the hotel but mine because I booked late and lower deck room already booked however chapel cottage really lovely but without the sea views but beautiful rooms and furniture. Food great in restaurant and love the bar be back again soon
2; We have just stayed in this hotel for two nights. The staff cannot do enough to help. A query over our shower was answered politely and helpfully. Our bedroom was large and comfortable, the shower did need updating but was adequate. The evening meal we had last night was excellent. Everybody was served at the same time, the food was well presented and hot Breakfasts excellent Ok so some parts of the hotel could do with an upgrade but mostly it was fine and we would certainly recommend. 
2; We booked the Brook Mollington through Superbreak and thought with it being a 4 star hotel that this would be fine and I wouldn't need to look into any reviews but a couple of days before we went, my husband decided to look on Trip Advisor to see what sort of review it received from other guests. We were a little shocked and worried with what people were writing and this really put a downer on our getaway for our anniversary. We arrived just after 3 and was greeted by the receptionist who was very helpful and told us where everything were, where we eat, the gym, the pool or room etc. We went up to our room which was very nice and over looked the garden, unpacked and went to check the facilities out. The hotel inside is very characteristic but in a nice way. As for the gym and swim pool for being dated, these weren't the case at all. All the staff were very polite and couldn't do enough for us. If I were being picky then there would be little bits in the room that could be replaced but there was nothing wrong like anyone on here. The location is perfect only 5 minutes from town and the Zoo which is why we went. It was a very peaceful hotel and we sat out in the gardens both days we were there.  Maybe the people that put a bad review on here have had bad experiences but we enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back! 
2; This is the first time we have been to Morley Hayes. We had a meal at Roosters Bar on a Saturday Evening and can highly recommend it. There was a nice atmosphere in Roosters and the surroundings pleasant. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was cooked to perfection. We will be going to Roosters again in the not too distant future. 
2;" On our second visit to Formby Hall in recent months we noticed that a number of conversations around us were about the booking system, so we were not the only ones who felt it needed tweaking. Conversations were about whether it is better to book treatments on the day of arrival or day of departure. Checkout is at 11am. You can book a treatment before your room is ready but this means having to lug your bags around before and after treatments. Not very satisfactory. Otherwise the staff ; food; accommodation and value for money are excellent. "
2;This was such a perfect little B&B for our 3 day visit to Torquay. Jeff was welcoming and very informative. He recommending places to visit and gave us directions to get to town etc. The rooms were very clean and the bathroom in the standard room we stayed in was very spacious. We didn't really make it to breakfast as we had lie ins so can't comment on that. The location is perfect to get around by foot or a short taxi ride. I would definitely stay here again. Great value, good service and clean!
2; Hotel situated in the centre of Exeter, near to shops and opposite Central Station. Traditional and grand lobby. Good service on reception. The room was a good size with all facilities you could want. Bathroom was adapted for those with restricted mobility. What really stood out was the breakfast - buffet style English plus continental with yoghurts, pastries, fresh fruit, juices cereals - best I've ever had. Excellent service at breakfast. As a lone female traveller, I felt safe and well looked after. 
2; We stayed at Bowood Hotel in Wiltshire on the most glorious sunny weekend. Our room was spacious, modern and stylishly decorated with a view across to the golf course. We had drinks on the terrace outside the Brasserie restaurant in the sunshine before a delicious dinner served by wonderful staff. Walking around the next day, the hotel is surrounded by an immaculately kept golf course and the grounds of the Bowood Estate. We visited Bowood House and Gardens which were a delight, the gardens are in full flower with roses on the terraces outside Bowood House and a cool green arboretum to walk through - a real treat of a day, would definitely recommend it as a way to wind down after a busy week. 
2; Stayed at Norton Grange for a long weekend. Accommodation, staff, food and facilities are all excellent but at 49 and 56 we did feel like we were the youngest there. The average age I would say is about 65 so bear this in mind if you book. Would go again but not for another 10 years or so! 
2;We visited this hotel from France in April for a 4 night break with my daughter and her husband.  Set in a lovely location the hotel was ideal for our purposes. Breakfasts were delicious and restaurant meals excellent.   The first room we were in was a very long walk from Reception but after the first night we were moved to a room near Reception. The room itself had been refurbished and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The staff were all helpful and friendly. Surprisingly, although there were weddings and a Murder Mystery weekend taking place during our stay, there was hardly any noise.  Will certainly be back and can highly recommend.
2; Went on Saturday with friends booked our table they were busy we had the carvery which was nice we had puddings which I really enjoyed the staff are really pleasant and nothing is too much trouble .but I thought £10.50 just for the car very is a bit expensive 
2; This hotel was everything that you would expect and a little bit more. The entrance hall is very grand. The staff were helpful, the rooms were comfortable and modern. The shower was very powerful. The bed was comfortable and spacious. Breakfast was also very good. 
2; Have just had couple of nights here as a surprise from my husband for a significant birthday. All in all a really good experience. Our executive room was extremely comfortable although quite warm. As mentioned previously the air conditioning doesn't seem to work too well. Nice toiletries and lovely soft towels. We ate in Nelson's bar both nights which we really enjoyed. Thought the menu in Ciro's a bit pricey. The weather was good while we were there and the gardens are beautiful so never got to use the spa as it seemed a shame to go inside. We did have a look at the Japanese garden which was delightful. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. 
2; I found this hotel on google and booked for 2 nights online directly with the reception . Having injured my shoulder recently in a fall, I sent an email to check the shower facilities as well as the parking, and received a reassuring phone call from the hotel receptionist straight away. We had the bad luck to arrive in Lytham St Annes at the height of the Desmond storm (85mph winds and torrential rain) so didn't benefit much from the sea-view balcony but the of the room was spotless, had 2 comfortable chairs and ample storage facilities. Breakfast choice was vast with plenty of fresh produce. Throughout our stay, the various staff members were attentive, gracious and helpful, ringing for taxis or lending a hand with luggage. The bar was closed, due to an emergency, but staff offered to get us drinks if required. We both enjoyed our stay and, if ever in Lytham St Annes again, we would certainly book there again. 
2; This hotel is in a great location near the Natural History Museum. It is very stylish with warm friendly staff and comfortable rooms. We had a bit of hassle over the keys to our room but on the whole we love this hotel and the breakfast buffet is above average for a hotel at this level. 
2; Oh dear it is not what it was. Don't get me wrong we had a very nice lunch but the restaurant use to be fine dining it is now a Bistro. Would we go again, yes if it was a nice day and we wanted to eat outside, the garden is lovely and you can sit under the covered area so it is not too hot. Well t was a good job it was not too hot the day we went or we would have died of thirst waiting for our wine.  When we arrived we decided to sit outside and have a drink whilst we looked at the menu. When the waitress came back we had decided what we wanted to eat so ordered and asked for the wine to be brought straight away. Well we waited and waited, a young man came with the glasses so we thought the wine would follow, another long wait until my husband went and asked if we could have the wine served.A good half an hour had passed by then. Not very impressive.  We had the set lunch which is good value but a bit not very imaginative. We went for the duck and black pudding sausage dish which was served with red onions, we had to order a side of potatoes, if we had not had a side we would have been left a bit hungry. For pudding we had the Pear and Almond tart which was delicious.  Sadly what was once a lunchtime favourite is no more. 
2; I've literally just got back from a trip to Stratford with my fiance, where we stayed at The Stratford for 2 nights... this was my second time at The Stratford (I came a few years back with my parents to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary) and the standards were just as good.  We arrived on Saturday at 1pm - we already knew about the car park charges (£5 per day) so this didn't come as a surprise to us thankfully - we planned to leave our car and head into town until 3pm check in time, but our room was ready for us so we were able to check in straight away.  We were in room 241 which was fantastic - the bed was HUGE (we later found out it was 2 singles together, but this didn't detract away from how comfy it was!) and the room was a brilliant size... we especially loved the bottles of water in our fridge as being a Northerner, I'm not used to drinking the water any further down South haha  We didn't use the restaurant or bar at the hotel as we found the prices to be a little out of our price range - £13.50 for a burger! Instead we went to The Thatched Cottage down the road for Sunday carvery which was AMAZING and such a cute little pub! We also visited Avon Spice after rave reviews on here but we have to say, although the food was nice, the atmospher and decor left a lot to be desired!  Breakfast at The Stratford was, as last time, lovely. You were personally shown to your table each morning and offered tea or coffee - there was a huge range of fruit juices available and a buffet breakfast offering something to suit every guest from cereals, toast with jam/marmalade/marmite/nutella/philidelphia, full english (with the nicest sausages I've ever tasted!), porridge, fruit, ham/cheese, pastries and chocolate cake!  So after my rave review, what was the small niggle I had?! Well, when we woke up on Monday morning the weather was terrible - we ventured into town and visited Shakespeare's birth place and got some lunch but by early afternoon we were cold and drenched - we remembered the TV in the room had film rental so decided we'd go back and catch a film (the selection of TV channels is poor - I'm not sure why they don't have Freeview?!) Anyway, after drying off we rang down to reception to set up the films on our TV - when she told me it was £10 I was a little taken aback but decided if we watched a couple of films, we'd get our moneys worth - then she corrected me and said it was £10 PER FILM! Now don't get me wrong, I am a huge film fan and spend so much on visiting the cinema, subscribing to Love Film and using Blockbuster, but to me £10 for a film in a hotel is ridiculous - a night out at the local AMC cinema here in Manchester is cheaper than hiring a film at this hotel - I wouldn't have minded so much is they were new releases, but they were showing Transformers 3 which is only £7 in HMV on DVD!   So to round up my review, the hotel was fantastic - the rooms are lovely, even if breakfast isn't included, it's worth paying that little bit extra to get it, the staff are helpful and friendly but if the weather looks as though it might fail you, have a back up plan or take Scrabble!! 
2; The Oxford Hotel was great for a little weekend trip to visit Oxford. Plenty of free parking and a just a short cab ride away (about £5-8 one-way to the city centre) and just a 30 sec walk to the nearest bus stop (£3.30 return ticket).  We were in room 207 which was quite a long walk away, and up stairs - difficult with luggage, as no lifts.  The rooms are not massive, but enough space to lay luggage around and still walk around easily. Bathroom was a bit basic but perfectly adequate.  Bed was very comfortable and it was great to have the air con - as it was a warm/muggy weekend.  Breakfast was good - lots of the usual continental options. There tends to be a queue for the cooked breakfast options, and it all goes very quickly, but other than that, I wasn't left wanting for anything.  Service at the reception was also very good - thank you! Great value hotel - would certainly come again and recommend it to anyone! 
2;staff at the hotel were excellent, helpful and considerate. The food was extremely good as was the service throughout, our room was clean and comfortable, and despite its location we found the traffic noise to be quite minimal.Ideally located for a stroll along the river or the high street. Well worth a visit if you are in the area
2;Lovely hotel with happy staff ready to help you ,The room was lovely and clean with the added bonus of a four poster bed .Evening meal was delicious as was the breakfast ,with plenty of choice .We both asked if it was possible to have an omellete even though it was not on the menu .No trouble and the chef came to check it was ok .Well done to everyone ,it was a christmas present from our daughter ,hence the same name ,no relation ha ha , thankyou we had a lovely time and would recomend this hotel
2; Clean and comfortable room. The staff are very friendly and helpful and I was delighted to be able to enjoy a welcome cocktail on the roof terrace. I would definitely choose here in preference to a chain hotel. As it's in Salford, It is a bit of a walk into town although not far from the Coronation St tour or the Museum of Science 
2; There is very little to fault about this hotel except for its lack of unique charm. As can be expected of any chain hotel (Hilton in this case) I felt as if I could have been anywhere in the world. The one redeeming factor as regards local character was the pleasant view out of our front-facing room onto the canal- very nice indeed. Tea and coffee facilities in room were very good, although no biscuits provided which I found disappointing. Also, no minibar, although this could be seen as an advantage if you're watching the pennies! Staff were very friendly and were more than happy to give us more tea bags and milk when we ran out. Breakfast was very good. A wide selection of pastries, cereals, nuts and dried fruit as well as fresh fruit (melon balls, dates/prunes (not sure which!), orange slices, granola and Greek style yogurt. There was also a good hot option: eggs cooked to order (I saw a lady ordering an omelette (at no extra cost) so service was excellent). Scrambled eggs were already under the heat lamp, a bit of a mistake to cook scrambled eggs in bulk because they tend to lose their moisture quite quickly! Grilled tomatoes, hash browns, bacon, sausages and vegetarian sausages were all there. Mushrooms would have been a nice touch. There was a wide selection of bread- white, brown, country-style loafs, bagels, crumpets etc were all available to be put through the toaster. There was also a good selecton of spreads. To conclude, a very good breakfast and good service from staff. I would highly recommend the hotel but would advise looking elsewhere if you were looking for a hotel with Sheffield charm. 
2;Stayed for just one night last week. The staff were very efficient and the service was good, a great atmosphere in the restaurant. Good value breakfast. Unfortunately we had a street facing room and as we are not used to cities it was not as quiet as we would have liked. The room was well appointed, large and the bed was very comfortable. Beware of the slippery bath though we both fell getting out of the bath even though we used the mat provided, this could be an issue if you had any mobility difficulties.
2;Once you drive up the sweeping drive, you are met by a drab and very large extension where the majority of the rooms are, 300 or so. We were worried that we would be staying in there. Once we checked in we realised we had been upgraded for not much additional cost. We were so relived. The receptionist didn't tell us a few vital pieces of information, such as check out time but that was fine. Our room was amazing and very modern. So quiet in the main part of the hotel. We were pleased. We didn't eat, but the restaurant looked rather nice as well. We drank in the library after dinner, a lovely relaxing room with no other guests which was really nice. The night porter was very nice as well. Overall a lovely and relaxing place, but glad we were away from the main guest area. Would return.
2; Nearly everything was good. Good selection of wines, nice menu and comfortable beds. The worst thing was the shower. The head was blocked and water pressure low. You couldn't turn it on unless you were standing in the bath and water always came out cold. The look of the bathroom was good, check to make sure you get one of their newer bathrooms 
2; This is a really nice hotel and they really do try to differentiate on service. The staff mostly went out of their way to be courteous and helpful.   My only areas for improvement would be a pillow menu as they were truly awful and meant we didn't sleep very well though the beds themselves were very good...   And whereas the A La Carte menus were really good, we found the hot breakfast to be very below standard, though the range of cold offerings wasn't bad. Maybe an egg chef station might add to the breakfast offering? We also had to wait a long time to have our coffees refreshed, maybe a pot on the tables (like the tea was) might be better? The breakfast staff were really rushed off their feet and seemed young and a bit inexperienced although keen.  Other the above, a very nice stay and an unusual and tastefully modern hotel. 
2;"This hotel has a great location, fantastic views over Poole Bay & the sea. My family (husband, offspring of 20 and 14 years) enjoyed the facilities for our 3 night stay, and my daughter had an hour sea kayaking as a free sample lesson at Sandbanks, the sister hotel. It was a fairly wet weekend so we didn't really get the benefit of the 2 balconies on our executive room (kids hung out in our room, so no need to pay for two executive rooms in my opinion). The view is great and endlessly interesting with all the boats coming and going You can hear the chain ferry but that didn't worry us. I also liked the direct access to the gorgeous beach.  All in all we enjoyed staying there but there were niggles small and large. The major complaint is that it is fantastically overpriced, you pay roughly twice what you should as prices are per person not per room.  The reason I took my family was a birthday present for my husband, I was feeling extravagant and I was sick of hearing myself say 'we should stay there, what a great location' every time we go to Poole (which is most years for a weekend). Then - never actually doing the deed and booking it.  We thought the downstairs layout very awkward, and lacking in architectural grace or in keeping with the original design of the hotel (20's/30's) - with a grand stair way facing the kitchen which is plonked in the middle of the public areas. Also dripping through the dining room from the spa was not great.  Upstairs with all that water everywhere I do think carpeted rooms are a big mistake - in damp weather they smell a bit - if they ever thoroughly renovate I would opt for some lovely tiles with rugs and underfloor heating, but maybe I am just fantasising what I would do with this building.  The standard of cleaning in both rooms was OK and the size of the rooms - especially the corner executive room was quite big. Internal hallways upstairs quite tired decor.  We thought breakfasts were OK especially if you have a cooked to order option. We had room service one night and ate in the lounge another night - again pricey I thought.  This could be a really great hotel & the prices would be justified; it isn't quite up to scratch frankly compared to other hotels we have stayed at for this amount of money. Maybe save up and go once for the view and the great location, but I really think the management could do a better job with the interior and come up with a more reasonable per room price.   Not sure I would go again."
2;We stayed 2/8/14 for one night before flying to the USA. On our arrival we were informed that our reservation showed the room was only for one person.....we are a family of 4! The reception staff weren't particularly friendly and informed us that there were no family rooms available and we would need to spend an extra £119 for an additional room on top of the £84 we had already paid for the one room. I am still baffled as to why our booking showed a room for one, it did show our comments in the booking saying could the sofa bed be made up ready for our two children.....I would of thought this would raise a question with the 'booking for 1' which would result in them contacting us to query the type of from we had booked?!!!  We asked if we could have a refund and try somewhere else but were told we were 15 minutes after they could have done so....with no choice we had to pay the extra. After speaking to the duty manager he dropped the price to £100 and we negotiated a discount on dinner for the evening.  I would like to thank the one gentleman on reception who kindly thought to bring over a cookie each for the children whilst we dealt with the booking confusion....a shame the receptionist dealing with us hadn't considered doing so or making an effort to be more friendly after our 6 hour journey to get there.  Apart from that, the hotel is lovely. The reception is very modern and welcoming, the 2(!) rooms we had were of the usual Hilton standard. Dinner was fairly pricey but the portion sizes were huge.  I would definitely like to stay again and will book again next time we fly from Heathrow.  
2; Stayed at the this hotel during a recent business trip. Conveniently located, great check-in service,room very nice with a very comfy king size bed,with all the amenities you will need in the room. Breakfast was delicious with loads of choices. Didn't give it a 5 star because we were not informed by the waitress that we could actually order from breakfast menu. We only found out by over hearing the same waitress telling the table next to us after 15min of sitting down. 
2;" Well situated hotel, near tube, shops etc etc. I arrived at 14.55, there were three other guests already checking in and I was next in the queue to be served. I don't know what those people were doing but nobody moved for 17 minutes and the reception staff seemed to be busily tapping their keyboards all the while.   At 3.13 the person at the &quot;Club&quot; reception desk called me over to check in, I have stayed there before and they have my details. However, because I was paying with a card that wasn't &quot;registered&quot; there was endless interaction between the receptionist and the keyboard.   I finally checked in at 3.25. The reason my times are so accurate is because there's a big clock in reception :). While I was standing in line, an air crew of about 8 or 9 arrived and they were clearly unhappy about the very long wait. This is unacceptable. Clean up your act guys and buy some new reception software. "
2; This hotel is rather like a traditional provincial department store, a quality product but a little worn around the edges. Obviously, one rates ones hotel stays mainly on price paid, pay cheap and don't expect too much, however, with Guyers Hotel, we paid a reasonable price for an excellent product. The hotel's reception rooms and bar were very welcoming and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent (although I do like the cereals to be in packets rather than open bowls). The only letdown was our room, which was a tad damp smelling. Would definitely stay at the Geyers Hotel again. 
2; Loved the location 5 minutes from the tube beautiful view of Hyde Park staff couldn't be more helpful very nice breakfast will be booking again in the summer for another weekend in London you can walk across the road to the park even jog if the notion takes you we didn't had a wonderful time meeting up with friends 
2; I stayed here for one night only and found little wrong with the hotel. I had a problem with the first room but I was immediately and politely moved to another room and offered a complimentary drink.The rooms are fairly standard hotel rooms but at least the windows open which is always a bonus! I had dinner with friends and was pleasantly surprised by the food. I'm not keen on the decor but it's clean and tidy, there's plenty of car parking and it's close to the motorway connection but reasonably quiet. The staff were polite and friendly and over-all it seems like a decent hotel. I'd stay there again if I need to be in that area. 
2;Stayed for a conference and was pleasantly surprised! The hotel was able to cater for a large number of people checking in. The food was good throughout the stay but I was particularly impressed that they could serve fish to over a hundred people without it being over cooked. I would happily recommend.
2; I stayed here recently for the blues weekend. We all had a great time, food was nice with good choices, chalet was decent and the activities a bonus! The price for all this was very resonable,  The restaurant is in the same room as the entertainment so there is a rushed feel to dinner as they need to clear everything away before a certain time - but then we were there for the entertainment. The waiter we had was excellent but the female waitress often appeared grumpy and stressed trying to serve lots of tables at once. I would say overall I would recommend this for a themed weekend. Hayling Island also has some nice pubs along the sea front :) 
2; Skegness is a great place for kids and adults. There is plenty off fish and chips bar and pubs to go and eats amazing rides that are really fast! I love going in the beach with my family and playing with them. 
2; I used to stay in this Holiday Inn quite often but haven't stayed for a couple of years. I had a really nice (upgraded) room and my colleague and I were able to use the public/bar area to work. We were disappointed to be turned away from the restaurant which seemed to have become fully reserved at the time we wanted to eat due to a bus party, so we had to eat in the bar area. The food was fine, not great but okay for bar food. The reception staff check-in and check-out was cheery and welcoming but the lady checking your room number for breakfast was quite the opposite! 
2; I stayed here for two nights with my daughter & two grandsons when we were on a coach trip to LEGOLAND &Warner Bros Studios. We were in a family room which had two double beds which we used and a spare camp bed. The room was clean, the beds very comfortable. The outlook from the window was over generators but we were hardly in the room to look out so weren,t particularly bothered. The food was buffet style which we liked although there wasn,t a huge choice for dinner, it was good though. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again. 
2;I enjoyed my stay apart from the heat in my room: it was boiling. Very large windows and inefficient air conditioning made the temperature in the room almost unbearable. There was no way of introducing fresh air into the room and it was very unpleasant. I contacted maintenance and there was nothing they could do to reduce the temperature. There was a wired in alarm clock which someone had set for 6 and I could find no way to turn it off because the LED was so dim it was almost impossible to see. Breakfast was very good
2;I booked two nights at the Alverton for a weekend away with myboyfriend. The hotel is beautiful as you approach it and inside just as lovely. Staff in general were very friendly and helpful. Our room was a garden view room which was gorgeous! The bed was huge and extremely comfy. Worth every penny.  I really enjoyed our stay, thanks to the staff for arranging the surprise birthday cake and Prosecco to be placed in our room for our arrival. Lovely weekend.
2; We stayed in the junior suite overlooking the canal, it was nice except it needs some tlc also the sofa was marked and torn. The staff were impeccable as expected. This is the only hotel we will stay in from now on in Leeds. Fab service from start to finish 
2; Had an evening meal at the Roslin, great views over Southend Seafront, food was very good although rather pricey in comparison, service was good although rather slow, took 1 hour from removing dinner plates to receiving dessert, took the shine off a nice evening 
2; Extremely friendly Hotel in the middle of London just across the road from Warren Street tube. We had a room on Tottenham Court Road which was a little noisy even with the secondary glazing. Very impressed with the eco-friendly touches and the double shower. The bed was very comfortable. The Internet seemed to be a bit 'slow'. 
2;" Stayed here for one night with friends and, from what our friend who booked it told us and from what we experienced, it couldn't have been better. Apart from maybe the bar staying open after 11.30pm on a Saturday night. From beginning to end, the staff here are fabulous. My friends and I all live in, or near, London and it was our &quot;Christmas&quot; weekend away to catch up, chill & relax. Our room was ready even though we arrived earlier than the usual check-in time, spotlessly clean, house-keeping staff checked that we had everything that we needed and thewindows could even be opened! I realise that's not a major point for many people but having spent a few sleepless nights in stuffy hotels where you can't open the window it was a welcome relief believe me.  Holiday Inn's have become a little soul less in some areas but not this one - honestly, the staff were great and it's in a fab location. The bar opposite has a long happy hour - though we didn't visit this time and it's a very short stroll away from what I think is a Wetherspoons pub where we had lunch on the Sunday. Yes, I know there are LOADS of great places to eat nearby especially in the market but we just wanted to sit down and relax before going home. The food may well have been microwaved & not haute cuisine by any stretch but it was value for money & we could hear ourselves talk - nope, I'm not that old (not yet anyway,lol) but it was a friendly busy place. Anyway, it's the hotel review you're interested in but just incase then this is close by and not intimidating if you're on your own. Also a few steps away from the hotel is Wagamama's. We went out on a Saturday night & hoped to come back early & have a couple of drinks in the bar but surprising, and a little unexpectedly perhaps for a hotel, they call last orders at 11.30pm. Being in Camden, with a multitude of choice in bars, this probably isn't a problem for most people but had I been on my own and just fancied a nightcap in relative safety and comfort then I'd have been out of luck. This would be the only slightly less than positive thing I'd point out. If you're on your own & not in the mood to brave a packed pub then just be aware.....if you like a tipple, best to bring your own unless you go to bed early! You can safely leave your luggage & collect when ready. Yes, this is a standard that I'd expect in most if not all hotels but one can sometimes be a little concerned or you can be made to feel like you're asking the earth. Not here - best hotel staff I have come across in a long time. Stay here, relax & soak up the atmosphere of Camden knowing you're never far from anything you may need! "
2; Stayed here two nights visiting a concert at the Royal Albert Hall just a walk across the park,very comfortable bed a good view from the 8th floor,breakfast was excellent and evening meal,try the burger, location is convenient to oxford street. The staff are very helpful will definitely stay here again. 
2; Stayed at the hotel in January and had a lovely room and very pleasant stay, returned this weekend and very disappoinnted, Our room had various faults definately not refurbished, painting going on in hallway, such a strong smell of paint that my friend who is astmatic was reallly unwell due to this and therefore we had to leave earlier and cut short our trip .We were told we had a newly refurbished room,decorating not finished and no rain shower which we had last time.   We did complain on leaving the hotel and emailed once home, and to be perfectly honest the hotet reservation team were extremely helpful and understanding and even telephoned us at home and personaly talked through our issues their customer care was excellent certainly 5 star. We will be returning to the hotel sometime in the near future, and are looking forward to our stay.  Thankyou very much for your understanding, kindness and sincere apologies. 
2; My husband and I stayed here for a mini city break to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel is very clean a spacious room with great walk in showers and complimentary toiletries. The food is excellent and the bar area on the second floor is fabulous with free pool table and play station use for guests. The decor is beautiful with lots of comfy chairs and sofas to relax while having a few glasses of vino! A special thank you to Emily and Tom for a warm welcome at arrival and help with information of what to do and see. Also to Chloe and Jessica nothing was too much trouble from these two lovely friendly girls. Thank you for making our stay an enjoyable one. Paula and Stuart Foster 
2; This hotel is situated on the banks of the Thames opposite Canary Wharf, and by offering a free shuttle service across the river, and with a good Underground service back to the centre of London, it is a great 'chill-out' destination on a busy sightseeing schedule. The staff were lovely and the room we had was spacious and had a great view over the river. Recommended! 
2; 8 of us stayed at the weekend as part of an overnight spa break, the price was reasonable so wasn't sure what to expect. The spa and treatments were excellent, health club a little small but had everything you'd need really. We loved the heated seats in the relaxation room! We had afternoon tea included in our deal which was SO slow, seated at 4.30 but didn't receive it until 5.15, which felt like forever because we were all starving - the food when it did arrive however was lovely, very tasty warm scones! We had similar feelings with the evening meal, the restaurant did seem quite slow to serve.  The hotel rooms were night on the whole, however our room had a lot of ladybirds in as the window was left open. When we called and asked to move rooms the staff were happy to move us and didn't make us feel like an inconvenience. Thanks to the duty manager also for a bottle of prosecco to apologise, was a nice unexpected extra!   All in all I would certainly return for another spa break as I did feel it was value for money but the slow restaurant did let it down a little bit. 
2; We were on a special deal from Waitrose magazine so knew we were going to get good value: champagne, chocolates and a fruit bowl in the room as well as dinner and breakfast.  We were staying in the Orangery (in room 50, which has been mentioned as being above the boiler - we didn't find it a problem). Our room was huge, as was the bathroom. Patio doors led onto a terrace with attractive seating. Unfortunately, a bit cold and windy at this time of year to make use of it. The main building has attractive public rooms, with welcoming log fires. Our dinner in the restaurant was exceptionally good. I was not expecting much of a choice as we were on a special deal, but in fact it was hard to pick as they all sounded delicious. We enjoyed all three courses and received excellent service. Indeed, the staff generally were really friendly and helpful, not at all stuffy, which can be a problem in some hotels.  Our breakfast was also very good, with a wide range of continental options and an ample full English. We used the sauna which was clean and comfortable with lovely thick towels and robes. Overall, a lovely base for a Cotswolds trip - highly recommended. 
2; Very well organised, was greeted with a map of the area, and a personal explanation of suggestive places where to visit and eat, Rockfish in town highly recommend, fish melts in your mouth. Room was lovely, very clean, en suite, the only thing I did not care too much for was the sanoflo toilet system, think it leaves a slight odour, however did not damper stay at all. Breakfast was perfect, right amount, and huge selection to choose from, the only think I found unusual was breakfast is served from 830 to 9 only, but I'm sure if asked they would accommodate other requests for timings?? Thank you 
2; Excellent value spa package. Upgrades were not expensive. Atmosphere lovely and calming. Made a great birthday present for my husband. Restaurant menus were full of choice and drinks were good value. Service is outstanding. 
2; We visited here on our way up through the Cotswolds as it was recommended by my sister who has stayed there before.  Staff were really friendly and accommodating which is an asset in a hotel of this quality.  There was a very comfortable seating area with a great selection of papers and magazines to relax with.  We decided to share two pizzas and were impressed with the quality of them, we really enjoyed this and struggled to finish them!  Although the atmosphere was fairly relaxed some of the music did cut through this at times and could be a little intrusive but on the whole it is a beautiful place which I would recommend. 
2;Breakfast really good and with a big variety of products.  Really nice and clean room, the only two bad things:  1) we could hear the noises in the corridor and sometimes from the other room. 2) the bed was a bit noisy  Close to the center and bus stop just outside the hotel.  Staff very kind!
2; My husband and I arrived back to Heathrow at 10pm following a long flight from Sri Lanka. The holiday Inn was perfect for a stop over so that we could rest before travelling home to the West Country.  Check in was a bit slow but then there was a lot of people trying to check in/out and only one member of staff. The rooms were a little on the small side but very functional. The buffet breakfast was exceptional quality with great choices. We would definitely stay there again  You do have to pay £10 per night for parking if you have not bought their park and fly package. 
2; Arrived on Sat midday and our room (9) was ready. Quaint room, nice decor and comfy bed and duvet, which is always a thing i like to rate. Comfort is the key. The staff were a bit of a mixed bag, lovely receptionist on arrival and check out. Restuarant has to be booked for both lunch and dinner or you get told off, we decided to eat elsewhere though as for a light lunch it was very pricey. The food we did have was lovely and nice selection for breakfast inc a great Bloody Mary bar (which i didnt have). The hotel is a 5 min walk to the beach and other cafe's so deffo worth a walk down Old Lydd road. Plus lovely Rye is 10 mins up the road. Also, this is a fab hotel for a wedding as the attached marquee style room was really pretty with the single gardens and outside seating area. 
2; This hotel is within the Open University complex and is obviously used extensively by visiting students, staff etc.  The reception and restaurant staff were extremely helpful - nothing was too much trouble. The food was surprisingly good at a reasonable price, something we don't always experience in other hotels.  On the downside the hotel itself is extremely shabby in the common areas, corridors and rooms. The bathroom was in dire need of a facelift and the shower in Room 336 is not to be recommended - not so much a shower as a few spots of rain! The room was large with plenty of storage space but no fridge and again, dreary and in need of a facelift. If you like firm beds - this one is for you!  That said, we would use the hotel again if only because of the friendly staff 
2;This was the first time we had stayed at this hotel and we found it excellent. The Brasserie is the best choice for both breakfast and the buffet dinner and also good value for money. We've always found the bar a little too pricey though.  Lovely bathrooms (although the bath is a bit high) but I loved the shower. Instant water at whatever temperature you want!  Good location if you want to go plane spotting too and if you need it there is a McDonalds right next door.
2;we stayed in the presidential suite and organised for balloons and prosecco to be in the room. They were a little late doing this which meant a bit of a wait. When we arrived in the room they had added the wrong name on the cake. All of this we laughed about and the room was spotless and stunning. We felt the customer service was a little lacking, ie we weren't shown where our rooms were, offered luggage service and in fact we had to go and find a cleaner to ask where we needed to go as only one lift went to the presidential suite. While we were waiting for our room we weren't offered any where to sit, and they didn't alert us when the room was ready, we had to keep queuing to go and ask. Also our tv and music didn't work and the engineer couldn't fix it. I would have expected to receive a slight discount because of this, as a nice gesture but we were not. Compared to other hotels you do feel a little forgotten about, its almost like staying in an apartment rather than a hotel. Having said that the breakfast was fantastic and the room and location also top notch so we would stay there again. We would lower our expectations on the service though so we are not disappointed. We may try other suites in London hotels to compare though?
2; We have stayed in this hotel before and it is very convenient for Stansted Airport....we really like this hotel as we are well looked after and can leave our car safely in their car park...very clean and very comfortable stay.....restaurant rather expensive however the waiters etc were all very attentive...we will use this Hotel again, I am sure  
2; I recently visited the Sandman Hotel when attending my christmas works do! which was idealy situated across the road at St. James Park. We had a good deal of £80 per room for the night inc breakfast. On first entering the hotel its very modern and chic...complete with a giant horse in reception! Our room had been upgraded to a twin which is also classed as a suite, this meant we had a great kitchen!!!! who would use the microwave, cooker rings, toatser etc in such a city centre hotel I have no idea but it did make me feel quite luxurious. The fridge was a bonus and kept the cocktails nicely chilled. The decor and furnishings were all very nice and good quality, the only down side to the room was the bathroom. The shower has 2 shower heads, one a power shower, one a rainfall shower, very nice but both will flood the floor as the very small drain lip is not enough, and dont bend down as you will likely singe your rear on the large very heated towel rail. The door for the bathroom was an attempt at industrial chic.... however it was a wonky sliding glass pane that didnt fit, didnt lock and meant little privacy. Breakfast was a buffet style selection, however do ask for the porridge if you like it as it wasnt offered, but when I enquire I was told i could have it and it was lovely.  Parking is available right opposite the hotel in the St Jmaes Metro station carpark, you need to go past the hotel (on your right) then go left and left again. You then get a ticket from hotel reception for the carpark. We had decided to go shopping the next day in Newcastle and take advantage of the location, however when my friend asked for carparking till 5pm she was told no it was for 24hrs and she had arrived at 3pm so only till then. I had been asked when I wanted my carparking ticket till and was given a 6pm pass!! parking did cost £8 payable when you check out the hotel but this was good value for city centre parking and convenience. The hotel is attached the the Sharks Gastro bar ( breakfast is located in here) and we did go in for drinks after the party. The prices are quite high but I would recommend a cocktails as you do get the whole shaker to top your drink up with so worth the price. 
2; We stayed here for 3 nights midweek (room 16) for our 20th anniversary and to be honest, there's not a lot you could fault it for. I've known of this hotel for years and always wanted to stay there, but never dared look as I'd assumed it was way out of my budget league. How wrong was I?? It was an excellent price, not only for the standard of hotel, but for it's rather glam location (and accessibility to central London of course). I requested a Georgian Junior Suite as did not want a modern room and we were given a great room on the ground floor with two large floor to ceiling windows in the old part of the hotel. The room itself was fantastic (couple of minor issues that didn't really bother us). The only issue we had was the size of the bathroom/bath and its lack of ergonomics! The shower had a personality as well ref temperature/pressure, which combined with the lack of space made for a disappointing appendage to an otherwise fantastic room. Breakfast was good, a comprehensive choice. There was a gift waiting for us in our room for our anniversary which was lovely. The reception at check in was very efficient, warm and welcoming. On checkout, there was a financial error (the fault of the hotel), which we realised when we got home and on contacting the hotel and then our bank, it was soon remedied by the hotel contacting our bank, which was a relief. The swimming pool was available, but not quite as 'exclusive' as one would like with a hotel like this and we didn't use it. The room was air-conditioned with a king size comfy bed. All round, except the bathroom, we'd both stay there again without hesitation. 
2;Stayed after attending a party in the hotel restaurant. The bar area is lovely and food good. Breakfast coked to order and served in front restaurant area which was bright and well attended.   Decor and ambience is nice - certainly not a budget hotel. Downstairs is lovely and modern with old style features such as the beautiful spiral staircase. Rooms were neutrally well decorated with only a few creaky floorboards (old hotel charm!)...All in all very romantic feel to the place.   Well stocked tray in room - although 2 bottles of water would have been better esp after a night partying in the bar!   The bed was enormous and so comfortable. ...pillows were best I've ever had in any hotel world wide so defo a big thumbs up in terms of quality of sleep.  Only downsides were noise from other rooms (how quickly we become accustomed to isolated rooms from other hotel chains!) and the temperature - it was sooooooo hot and only had 1 window (no AC). I'm always cold normally so i can't imagine how hot - blooded folk would cope in there! Oh and the lighting. ...lovely romantic low mood lighting but terrible for applying makeup before an evening out!!!  Those niggles aside it was a lovely couples get away. Staff curteous - even slipping a note under our door to advise us of noise from party as we were at back of hotel ...We were at party but did go back to our room at one point in evening. ...OMG it was loud so I'm very glad we weren't tring to have an early night/felt sorry for the room next to us with a baby!  However all in all I would definitely recommend this hotel ....probably not for one with the kids, but great for a romantic getaway!
2; We were in Sidmouth for the Folk Festival and, dying for a cuppa on our way back to the coach, chose the nearest place, the Rivieira Hotel on the Esplanade! It is a beautiful building with extensive outside space for al fresco dining, which is where we sat. We were served quickly and efficiently by the attractive staff, but were miffed to find that two cups of tea had cost £7.50. However, after our tea, we climbed the luxuriantly carpeted stairs, following the arrow to the delicately titled Powder Room, which was immaculate. This is an up-market hotel, so of course we paid the price but it was worth it, really! 
2; Myself and a group of 6 girlfriends stayed on a Saturday night. The hotel is gorgeous, really unique with amazing period features. Very centrally located right next to New St Station and close to everything really. The breakfast was beautiful and the staff lovely. The only downside were the TINY double beds in all of our rooms. Luckily we were all girls sharing, but if I had come with my husband we would never have fitted into one of these tiny beds! Also the pillows were really lumpy, so not a comfy nights' sleep unfortunately. The bathrooms are massive which seems a little excessive and they could fit larger beds into the bedrooms if the bathrooms weren't so huge! But overall a lovely place to stay! 
2; A friend and I stayed in this hotel for one night. The hotel itself was very clean, tidy and quiet. The rooms were spacious, well equipped with complimentary water bottles and again very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room temperature was easily controlled. The receptionists were very helpful and did everything for us to make it a peaceful stay. Would stay there again. 
2;Stayed for now night before going on holiday , we booked the best room on a bed only, it was very nice night sleep, very clean and tidy . We had a drink before dinner that was £12 for 2 drinks in the bar , only 2 gin and tonic nothing special , the dinner was very nice and we found it cheaper to buy the bottle of wine than 2 glasses . All in all it was a good Hotel for an Airport with no aircraft noise at all , will use it again
2;I know Bournemouth well and used to work within the tourism industry so booked this hotel based on previous knowledge.  The hotel itself is completely fine but I am not sure it quite lived up to 4*. On arrival the check in process was a bit slow and we had to wait around to find out if our room was ready. I did ask the girl what time check-in was but rather than giving me an answer she proceed to check me in - so I assumed we were not early.   Our room was lovely with a nice big bed. However it was incredibly hot. We were on the ground floor so leaving the windows open wasn't something we felt comfortable with and there was no air conditioning or fan in the room. After trying to cool the room down I did call for a fan at front desk and it was quickly sent to us. However this was not enough to keep the temperature down for the whole weekend.  The shower was a bit of a pain as I couldn't turn it off and sent water all over the bathroom when using it. That said it was perfectly clean and the complimentary toiletries were very welcome.   We left our room at 10am on the Saturday to go for breakfast and do some shopping. We came back at 2pm to freshen up before getting some dinner and our room hadn't been made up (despite leaving the sign out to have it cleaned). This was a shame as we needed new towels - from the drenched bathroom as a result of the shower! We had to chase down the porter for some fresh towels and tea/coffee and he was very helpful.  We then had a knock on the door from someone who wanted to check the mini bar. He then claimed we had eaten some pringles - we were never given any pringles. We explained this to him and he suggested that we make front desk aware that he would have to charge us for them. This didn't seem right to me, I'm not sure why I had to raise an issue that wasn't my fault.   All in all everything was fine on check out. The hotel is fine, the staff were nice, the area is perfect and the room was clean and tidy. No parking and some house keeping issues has resulted in my 3 star review as it wasn't worth the £210 we paid.
2; This well-located hotel is attractively-furnished, rooms are extremely comfortable, and staff are friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and warm (but not stuffy). The atmosphere was relaxed and there is a pleasant seating area in which to have a coffee or meet friends. Right in the middle of London, you only have to step out of the door and so many sights are within walking distance. An added bonus are a couple of patisserie shops/cafes right next door with EXQUISITE pastries in the window, beckoning you inside! With Boyds Brasserie within the hotel precincts, offering scrumptious breakfasts, lunches and afternoon tea, and Bianco 43 Italian Bistro just along the corridor, this is the perfect hotel for a stay in London. Thoroughly recommended 
2; We booked a 2 night package in March as our 'mini-moon' and we really enjoyed our stay. At reception, we were met by the lovely Fabiola Perez who made sure we enjoyed our stay (gracias, Fabiola!). We were shown up to a nicer room than the one we had booked and found a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us. Every member of staff we met asked if we were enjoying our stay, which made us feel very welcome. One of the reasons that I am not giving this review a 5 star is the food choice. My husband is vegetarian and the only options in the package deal were pasta for both lunch and dinner. He could have chosen from an alternative menu but he shouldn't have had to. There definitely need to be more vegetarian options available.  The other reason for a slightly lower grading is our experience at the Conversatory one evening. We asked for the larger cocktail list and were curtly informed that this was the Conservatory, not the Cocktail Lounge. When I asked whether I really would have to go to the Cocktail Longe (a few steps away from the Conservatory) for a cocktail of my choice, the waiter backed down and offered an alternative. The drinks took a very long time to arrive and were eventually brought to us at our dinner table. To be fair, the waiter salvaged the situation quickly and nicely, but it didn't leave a good initial experience.  Meals in the Brasserie felt a little like a canteen, but the quality of the food was really good, especially at breakfast and lunch. We had a few spa treatments which were excellent. Lovely, friendly staff in the spa as well. The swimming pool area got quite crowded, but not overly so. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning soon. 
2; Booked this for a friend and I for a Birthday Treat , Found the sfaff v friendly and the offer quite good value considering the price paid , maybe more of the sandwiches and less of the cakes and scones but still happy with it all .  Hotel 5 mins from Paddington Station so good location and Hyde Park opposite , had an enjoyable day overall.. 
2; We stayed in a lovely room, very clean and comfortable. Also very quiet for a city centre hotel. Although the balcony made it feel like we were slightly imprisoned because of the metal stopping birds sitting on it. The view wasn't fabulous but it's only Bristol. The breakfast was delightful. Such a wide range and freshly made pancakes and omlets on request.  Would stay here again 
2; This is a traditional and quirky place to stay with a nautical theme. We had a lovely welcome from the lady on reception who couldn't have been friendlier. The rooms we had were quite small but had everything in them that they needed.  The hotel is decorated throughout with nautical memorabilia which make great talking points. It's worth having a walk round the various rooms, lounges and bars to see the collection. The main bar downstairs was always packed with a great atmosphere. Plenty of local beers and ales to try.  We ate in the restaurant here one night, it was OK but nothing very special. 
2; Location was excellent with parking close by. The room was extreamly clean and had plenty of extras such as tea / coffee making facilities. Staff were efficient and friendly. Overall a very satisfactory and enjoyable stay 
2; Great hotel and in good location ,very clean and breakfast well worth the money . ONLY DOWN PART was we asked the Manager to book us a taxi ,and was told no , we were told it was hard for taxis to get into the road ,and if we walked to the end of the road , in the rain we could flag a taxi down . This did spoil the overall experience of our stay. 
2;Attended with friends on a very busy evening. Friends have attended often and so expected it to be an excellent night. the food was very good with plenty of choice, check your wine as our white wine was not a full bottle. it was changed with apologies, nevertheless would not have expected this to happen.  there were several groups dining and we were in the separate room usually at an extra cost, but we were not charged for the room.  will attend again.
2; My husband and I have been coming for years and would recommend it to anyone. Such a beautiful place with lovely staff. Food delicious, the whole experience is just deal for us. Not cheap but you pay for what you get and i is worth the fe exrapounds 
2;Spent 2 nights here 22nd-24th July. The hotel is very central for all the main attractions and within walking distance to them The hotel was lovely and clean and the room was large and very comfortable and had Aircondition The bathroom had a walkin shower and towels were large and very fluffy.Was on the 5 floor and on the quiet side of the hotel. Had breakfast on both morning and this was excellent and all you could eat. Also had the £12.95 meal deal on the Friday evening and this was very nice Had a snack on Saturday evening before going to a show this also was very nice .The hotel is in a great location for all the Theatres Will certainly stay this hotel again when visiting London great value for money
2; Room very clean and comfortable, within the Gatwick North Terminal, perfect for a night before or after a flight. We had a double room with sofa bed. Only downside was the prices in the bar, very overpriced. Didn't stay for breakfast due to early flight. 
2; Had one night here for a family party nearby. Lovely hotel and setting. Rooms small but well appointed, although the 2 rooms we had on the 1st floor didn't have air con and became very hot and stuffy. We also had a room on the 3rd floor, which had very effective air con. Reception staff were not very friendly when my daughter tried to check in ahead of me (and my credit card!) 
2;Excellent location for Royal Ascot, the staff were very helpful in allowing is changing facilities as we arived before our check in time. Highly recommended and great value for money, pity about the high prices being quoted for the same time next year so we will have to wait and see!
2; We stayed here for 1 night as part of a bundle with airport parking. Found it reasonably easily (blaming my sleep deprived brain!!) Warmly welcomed, and seemed nicely decorated throughout on first impression. Our room was fine, not huge, but plenty for us, really comfy beds, lovely clean white sheets, and great pillows (important!) Loads of hot water, so a nice hot bath (although the bath was a bit small), and warm towels thanks to the heated towel rail. We were only given a single towel which was a bit weird, although I guess I could have asked for more felt a bit cheeky doing it. Had a great night's sleep. Breakfast the next morning was great. Free parking and free wifi also were very welcome. In short, perfect for a single night stay and would be happy to stay here again. 
2;" Each year for the past few years, a luxury Spa Day has been a Christmas present from my family taken just before the next Christmas to prepare me for the holiday &quot;stresses&quot;. I have always found it a lovely day & very relaxing. However, unfortunately, this year I was a couple of weeks later than usual and it was a VERY busy day. Arriving at 9 I was greeted at reception by a friendly helpful member of staff who offered me a tour but, having been before, I politely declined. Looking at my itinerary I then saw that my treatments did not start until midday & then with lunch after the first, they all ran one from the other. They are usually nicely spread out to savour the results of each. Due to the large numbers of people and groups around, I was disappointed that the &quot;quiet areas&quot; were not quiet and I could not find anywhere to sit quietly. The actual treatments were as good as ever and the therapist who did my pedicure before I went home was brilliant and released some of my tensions (as opposed to the expected relaxations) of the day. On checking out I queried about the Gift Package of products which was advertised as being part of this not inexpensive day. The girl appeared bemused until she looked something up on the computer but said she had not been left any packs but would go and find one. (How many others missed out on this). However, after 15 minutes my lift home was getting agitated so I had to leave after being assured that the pack would be sent to me. As yet, 2 weeks later, I still have not received it. I realise that I was booked on a very busy weekend. Having had such positive visits in the past I have requested another Luxury Day for my Christmas present this year! See you all again then! "
2; Stayed at this hotel in 2013 and was really poor and was a shame as had always been good. Recently returned and all improved. Bedroom clean although cold (night staff provided a portable heater immediately) Food fantastic and breakfast to die for! Well placed hotel for Liverpool city centre and nice to see it back on form! x Marriott now has free wifi for all rewards customers son dont forget when it gets charged to your bill to ask for it to be removed! 
2; the church is alovely hotel staff friendly food very nice location excellent for near by york centre rooms lovely small but needs air con thats a must will stay again thanks every one we had a great time xx 
2;" We managed to secure a Friday night in a river view room for a bargain price of not much more than £60.   For the price we paid, the quality of the room was very good. It's in a great location, was tastefully decorated, everything seemed reasonably new, fresh and clean, and even the towels were white and fluffy and not old and tired-looking like you sometimes find. I particularly liked being able to watch and hear the TV channels from the screen in the bathroom.  There were a few little niggles, such as I couldn't get the shower as hot as I would like, though it was in no way unpleasant. Nor could I get the temperature of the air-conditioning as cool as I would like, even despite the sub-zero temperatures outside. These are minor points though and I didn't even feel the need to report them to the manager, and they definitely wouldn't put me off staying at this hotel again.   Of slightly more concern was the sound-proofing between our room and the corridor. I felt like I heard every single person go by and late at night after a few drinks, people aren't usually thinking considerately about other guests that might be trying to sleep. A bit more effort into sound-proofing the door to the rooms wouldn't go amiss, though should I return, I will be asking to be put in a quieter room rather than a river-view room to get round that problem.  My biggest issue whilst staying at this hotel was something that wasn't quite the hotel's fault, but that I think needs to be mentioned - the NCP car park. When we checked-out of the hotel and presented our meticulously kept parking ticket for the 25% discount, we were told by the reception staff that it was unreadable, but not to worry, just press the HELP button at the NCP pay station and it would be sorted out. Little did we realise how long this would take.   The pay-stations would not recognise our ticket either. Pressing the HELP button on both machines resulted in no response from NCP at all. Calling the 0845 number on the machine and trying to get through to NCP's customer helpline for assistance resulted in being placed on hold for several minutes before being dumped on an answer-machine that after leaving all my details and explaining we couldn't get out, so far has not resulted in any call-back. In the end the only way we got any assistance was by pressing the help button on the exit barriers which were eventually answered after about 10 minutes of them constantly calling and NCP resolved our problem some 5 frustrating minutes after that. We were really fortunate that the exit was quiet at that time as we would have greatly inconvenienced other customers. I'd say that we were hanging around in the cold for at least 20 minutes (it felt like longer) trying to exit the car park; something I never wish to have to go through again.  During this time another couple arrived at the pay station, who had been staying overnight at the nearby Premier Inn. Their ticket exhibited the same problems ours did so as I said, this hasn't really got anything to do with the Mercure, but it was such an awful experience, I felt it was worth mentioning. I would think more than twice about bringing my car to this area again unless there was a better exiting solution in place than there was when we stayed, for example if the hotel could issue a parking pass if we paid the parking fee directly to them - especially if the ticket showed as unreadable when they processed it for the discount at check-out. "
2;"Absolutely loved staying here. Unfortunately, we were only able to stay for one night, but will definitely be staying again. It is everything you expect from Malmaison; with quirky features and fabulous interior. The room we stayed in is laid out differently to a normal hotel room, which in my opinion gives you more space, and a huge bathroom! Something i noticed too was the lovely smell in the room, it was as if someone had gone round and sprayed perfume, i don't know what it is but it smells gorgeous! Breakfast was nice, and completed what was a lovely stay :) thanks to the staff and everyone at the manchester malmaison."
2; We only stayed at the Hilton for a night, but we were very satisfied with the whole stay. The hotel looks in great shape, modern and clean, and it's a shame we couldn't make use of the pool or the sport facilities, as they looked really nice. Staff at reception was very helpful and pleasant upon arrival, answering our question regarding the room, meals, shuttle bus the morning after, etc. The room was nice and clean, TV -with personal message for us- and other devices all working and in good condition. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone in need of a place to stay close to the airport. Or even for a nice, relaxing weekend! 
2; Great hotel for a shopping trip, situated in Leeds city centre within walking distance from station. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Some of the decor is a little tired in places and breakfast although of good quality could have been hotter. Room service was excellent. 
2;" The hotel has welcoming staff - all very pleasant. I visited overnight with my son. The rooms are very clean and comfortable with lovely fluffy pillows and quilts. Great bathroom with a good shower. Had a good night's sleep although the room was a little too warm and couldn't open the window. We had a nice meal in the evening. We enjoyed the food, and had a couple of drinks. Not too impressed with the service charges that are added, but these were removed from the bill at our request as we prefer to make our own &quot;tipping&quot; amounts. The reception staff were very helpful and rang us taxis when needed. Although there was building work taking place at the hotel, this did not prove a problem to us. All in all an enjoyable stay and would love to visit again in the future. "
2; We went to hotel straight from our wedding reception, the staff were very welcoming, and it is a comfortable place to stay and so convenient for the airport, just a short walk along the elevated sky-way. Our one concern was lack of storage place for clothes, it really is geared for one night bookings, any longer and you have to live from your suitcase. As it was our honeymoon, it was good to be welcomed with a bottle of chilled bubbly. With a room overlooking the airport it was amazing how very quiet the room was. 
2;My husband and I have just returned from a 2 night stay booked with Superbreaks and we found it a great place to stay.  We were checked in promptly and were pleased when we got to our room to find it spacious and clean.  We had our evening meal included for the first night as part of the package. We found the staff to be friendly although it did take a little time to get the specials menu and we did having to ask for an accompniment to my starter. On the whole the food was good. I had belly pork for my main which was a bit fatty but both starters and desserts were superb. The drinks were quite expensive in both the resturant and the bar so we just got a couple.  My husband and I had a lovely night sleep but would agree with previous comments that the mattresses are soft. Although this is what we like it may not be for everyone.   Breakfast was great and we were really please it was open until 11am which suited us as we were there for a romantic break. The sausages specifically were good. Again I food the staff friendly.  The leisure centre was lovely and clean. It was rainy when we went so we were able to fill in time relaxing there using the pool, jacuzzi and sauna.  All in all we had a really great time and would be return again.
2; Ate in The Feathers on Sunday Evening. Helpful staff, good size portions and reasonably priced. Had the lamb dinner, very tender and lots of meat. Asked if I could have a yorkshire pudding and they said yes no problem. Would go back again. 
2; We opted for the bubbles and dreams package...a bargain at £99 as it included a lovely room over looking the Millennium Bridge, a glass of fizz and a continental breakfast (which could be upgraded to a cooked breakfast for just £2). The room was a really good size and came with everything you could ask. The rooms were clean, beds were very comfortable and the shower was fab! The staff were really friendly and went out of their way to ensure brilliant service was provided. Having gone for a mid-week break some friends we wanted to check out the Spa, we were disappointed to find this was just a very small sauna room and a relaxation room (however we were basically told that this was for paying clients who were waiting for their treatments), needless to say we therefore didn't bother using the spa.  All in all a lovely stay and we will be returning. 
2; We booked into this hotel on 10 3 12 for an early flight the following morning. We were able to leave our car in the hotel carpark for the duration of our 4-day trip to Poland, which was very convenient. The hotel is charming with its art deco style. Our bedroom was clean, quiet and very comfy. We enjoyed dinner in the dining room before a good night's sleep prior to our 5am wake-up call. We were supplied with a good picnic breakfast to take with us. The staff were excellent - very polite and helpful. We would certainly use this hotel again if we needed to stay close to the airport. 
2; Stayed in this hotel for 1st time in September had several issues. However came back to stay in October and I must say it was a MUCH better stay 2nd time around. At check in the member of staff was so polite and friendly. We had the business class white rose room which was beautiful. Room was clean, spacious. It had a fridge, walk in wardrobe, large bathroom with bath and separate shower, our room has water, tea/hotchocolate and a coffee machine, tv, and cabinet with glasses and wine glasses and a large study desk. We tried the desert which was chocolate brownies was beautiful. I recommend staying here. It's quite a romantic hotel as you get bath robes and slippers and it's a comfy cosy hotel to just unwind in. There is parking facilities next to hotel it's £13 for 24hrs it's in a parking complex so your car will be safe but you have to take ur parking ticket /coin to reception and they apply a discount so u get ur parking for 13 pounds. Also in the complex attached to the hotel is a nandos, zizis, cafe rouge, browns 
2; Was meant to stay there for a gig at arena but it was cancelled so we came anyway to chill and see the sites. Discovering an offer for champagne afternoon tea for 2 for £19.95 put a halt on site seeing and off to the restaurant we went. Bit of confusion with offer by eventually resolved. The afternoon tea was great there was no rush to finish and view was fab onto the gardens. Cheap start to the day. Room was big very clean. Really comfy beds, AC free wifi big slow but still good.  Staff were friendly. Would stay there again but it's a real shame that I can get a better deal using 3rd party website rather than going through reception :( might want to look into that.  Breakfast had good selection but a bit more care needed with cook to order items. Had eggs benedict and there was way too much hollandaise sauce had to scoop it off only 1 overbooked egg and bacon was dry. There's a huge buffet though so wasn't left hungry by any means. I think this was just a hiccup as rest of food was good 
2; Stayed there with my partner for a couple nights, we has a double room with ensuit and kitchen facilities fully equipped. The level of cleanliness within the rooms was very good, i had no problems with the state i found it in. in fact i found it looking very spacious, modern and we were very comfortable. The location is convenient to where we wished to go, close to transporation and major attractions. The receptionist who checked us in, directed us to a beutiful breakfast and lunch area and provided us with 20% voucher dicount as a referal. and so i am very surpised at the negative feedback this place has been getting. Some people need to be fair with their comments. 
2; It was all going so well until breakfast. Flying Fish restaurant was excellent, food and service could not be faulted. We came down to breaksfast at 9.25, there was no fruit salad, empty bowl for the duration of our sitting and there were empty trays where the bacon and something else should have been. Never did see that filled up. It took at least 10 minutes for the bacon to arrive, by that time I had to do with mushrooms and egg. There were no glasses for the fruit juice. We were told we good order extras from the menu but no one came to take our order. 
2;" Not first time we have stayed and what a beautiful and &quot;grand&quot; hotel it is with stunning views over the ocean towards Brixham and looking over at Torquay town. The staff are excellent - friendly, professional and nothing is too much trouble for them. The chef is to be complimented - the menu is good , food excellent and well presented.....could haved stayed in the Restaurant all night!! The pools are wonderful and very clean. Such a shame though that some of the rooms are still in need of some tlc.  With definite decorating/upgrading needed in some of the rooms and bathrooms. Needs flat screen TVs installed - been a long time since I have stayed in a hotel room with such old TVs!! Even with the constructive criticism it won't stop us going back and hopefully the refurb will be in place for our next visit! "
2; My husband & I stayed here for 1 night before we flew the following morning.  The hotel was very busy but we found somewhere to park and were checked in quite quickly.  The standard room was large (great for when you have large suitcases), the bathroom had plenty of toiletries, fluffy towels, and the shower was very good. I know hotel showers can vary quite a lot! The room had nice touches such as biscuits to have with hot drinks, 2 chocolates and also a 'sleep assist pack' consisting of pillow spray and a rollerball for pulse points.  There are a good choice of bar/restaurants to choose from while stopping here but they were very busy when we visited. We ate at The Grill and had good food and service. Check out was again very fast and the shuttle to the airport terminals leaves on demand! 
2; A Peaceful, quiet location in residential street.   Very close to Olympia, Kensington High Street, and Underground.  On street parking free on Sundays. Parking restrictions/charges at other times.  A warm, friendly welcome. Stylish, contemporary, well equipped, comfortable room. Plenty of places to eat and shop nearby. 
2; I arranged to have our annual team conferance at this hotel in early December. I was delighted with the professional caring attitude of all the staff.Every need was catered for during our day of meetings which were held in the cosy library overlooking the picture postcard views of the water.There were plenty of fresh refreshments even strawberries and grapes on our table. The bedrooms vary in size but are all of a high standard and very snug. The only fault we had was that the dining room , whilst nicely appointed was very cold and draughty which somewhat spoiled our dining experience. I would recommend this hotel for small business meetings and most definately for a romantic weekend in an idylic part of England. 
2; The hotel was a fantastic venue for our staff party for nearly 300 people. An excellent city center location for those who with local, and discounted parking and accommodation for those further away. The staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful on the night and in the organisation of the party. The night was a huge success and the room looked lovely and festive and we would certainly consider using them again! 
2; Just come back from another stay at this hotel, as always the room was clean, fresh, and comfortable, and the staff friendly and helpful. I always stay here on business when I'm working in the area. I've stayed in a couple of rooms now and they've all been to the same standard. I think they're really good value for money considering the room rate. The restaurant is good,and the meals always feel like good value for money. There's a really nice bar in the restaurant. Bit surprised by the previous negative comment given the overall upkeep and presentation of the hotel, I've stayed in a few upper and lower rooms and I can't say I've ever come across any room to that condition or standard. I'm sure if they weren't happy with the room and they raised it to the staff immediately they would have moved them straight away. Can't say I've ever taken much notice of the road noise. I'll be staying there again next time I'm in the area. 
2;Booked this hotel within 2 days of visit. Had lovely suite of rooms with panoramic views of Seahouses harbour. Evening meal & breakfast were both excellent. Bathroom was small, but adequate. Rooms were very clean and staff very helpful.
2;" Room - had a small suite, a lounge and a bedroom. Lounge was small and comfy with nice TV. Bed was comfortable and we had a good night’s sleep. Shower was excellent; we were positioned in a good location with little/no noise - except we didn’t have a view. Spa - Lovely swimming pool, and my treatment (massage) was excellent, staffs were friendly and we had a small terrace area to sit, outdoor bit was the best! Lounge/Bar - Nice seating areas, with some private tables to snuggle up on. Staff were attentive and talkative, especially the 2 bar men who served us (I'm sorry I dont remember thier names, both tall), and they also made excellent coffee. Restaurant - Food was ok, service was alright, When i asked a question about the menu the waitress paniced slightly and ran off to ask someone else, I expected a bit more from a 4 star hotel. Breakfast was a bit old-fashioned with someone serving you and you not being able to serve yourself - perhaps they thought i would take 5 pieces of bacon or something!! On the other hand the barman who helped us choose the wine before dinner was delightful and knowledgable. Location - Excellent for Southampton and Portsmouth, situated close to the motorway but you couldnt hear any road noise! Easy to find. Overall, a good stay, very clean and tidy, will probably return. "
2; This was our second visit to The Angel and although we enjoyed it just as much as our first visit some parts of the hotel are beginning to look a bit sad and in need of some tlc......new carpets and a lick of paint in some areas wouldn't go amiss. 
2; what a beautiful place to spend a romantic date, the view of the canal was amazing and refreshing to see in the middle of a city centre. The sky lounge has an amazing view and the cocktails were tasty. staff are friendly and efficient. The rooms are not very romantic they are modern and airy and the imac computer was a big hit with my boyfriend,floor to ceiling windows made waking a special sunny moment after an amazing nights sleep for both of us . cant wait to stay again. 
2; When I read some of the negative reviews about the hotel I wonder if people are talking about the same hotel I stayed in or just being picky for the sake of it. I stayed 1 night as part of a theatre break. The staff were very friendly and could not do enough for us. Our room - although small - had all the amenities you require and who stays in their room in central London other than to sleep. It was quite a warm night and so we left the window open and did not close the curtains - no problem. The beds are very comfortable and very clean as are the rooms. We opted for the continental breakfast and there was as much as you could eat   I would certainly stay their again 
2;Ideally situated opposite Hyde Park. 25 minute walk through beautiful park taking in the Princess Diana memorial and Peter Pan statue to Knightsbridge. Lancaster Gate tube station 2 minutes walk from Hotel. Friendly accommodating staff. We had a lovely room comfortable bed coffee machine and tea making facilities in room which was a nice touch. Food in hotel was nice, we ate breakfasts and evening meals here and food was consistently good.
2;" The room I booked via a booking website was all that I needed - within my limited budget, booked quite late, walking distance of Paddington and feeling safe to get there as I arrived late, on a road that did not have night clubs nor shops opening early !----; good free WiFi service and the time to book out was more relaxed than is usual, which meant I could do some work in the morning without balancing papers in a station cafe. I dont usually do reviews but have done because of the service, and particularly the staff were helpful , including the bar staff getting me something that was not in the bar,  the room was comfortable, it was dubbed a deluxe single and felt like a double in most hotels. "
2; I stayed here for 2 nights - really clean, modern and comfy. Food was good and the staff in particular were friendly and really happy to help. Room service food as also good which is where some hotels fall short. I would definitely stay here again - recommended  
2;"This was our first to Manchester so a central hotel was chosen The Midland did not disappoint as it's city centre position was ideal for a short stay The entrance hall and reception were very impressive Reception and concierge staff were friendly and attentive. The public area in the entrance hall, serving drinks and snacks ,was always busy but slow service was disappointing although well staffed. Our bedroom on floor 5 was large and quiet although a bit dated . The room was spotless The large bathroom looked as though recently decorated and was of a high standard. We had breakfast only once in &quot;Mr Coopers&quot;. The choice of food was poor and the quality of an average standard eg 2 sliced breads and small white batons only, very limited choice of fresh fruit no bagels no fried eggs and only 3 rashers of bacon left . These comments may seem petty but the breakfast cost was over £17.00 per head !!  However the evening meal in the same restaurant was excellent a good menu choice very attentive staff and reasonably priced The Spa area was obviously recent. The pool rather shallow for swimming but the gym and relax area excellent. i would stay again because of location and friendly staff"
2; Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Room very comfortable, although air conditioning a bit noisy, ear plugs would have been handy. Breakfast very pleasant and again staff pleasant and hard working. 
2; Stayed at the park plaza for one night in April prior to a job interview. The hotel itself is large, clean and sleek but some of the features such as the face on the wardrobe door are pretty distracting and a bit spooky when your trying to sleep!   The pool and spa are a great feature for a London hotel and I enjoyed a swim and sauna Im the afternoon once I had arrived. The central location means there are loads of different restaurants nearby, and the breakfast buffet the hotel provides is tasty but not worth the change! 
2; We were married in the Raddison's observatory 10 years ago & wanted to return for a pre dinner drink on our anniversary. After contacting the hotel it was arranged for us to visit the 'now' business class lounge for drinks & canapés whilst enjoying the wonderful view - just brilliant!!!  We then had a delicious meal in the restaurant with a complimentary glass of Champagne ! Thank you to all the staff that made our anniversary such a wonderful evening !!! You fussed over us now just as much as you did 10 years ago. 
2; We stayed at the Crowne Plaza due to a show we were going to at the Rock City venue on Saturday night (literally a two minute walk from the hotel which was perfect). The hotel itself is lovely and the staff were incredibly helpful and gave you a warm welcome.   The room was of a very good standard (beds very comfortable, slept very well!), I felt that the room service menu was quite expensive but the breakfast was lovely, well set up and very enjoyable.   The only thing to note is the £12 overnight fee for parking but in such a built up area just to have a good place to park your car and directly next to the hotel is a plus despite cost especially given the completely lack of parking at other hotels in the area.  Would definitely stay again for any future visits to Rock City - very handy location. 
2; Comfortable hotel, good, clean modern rooms. Ordered room service - lovely and very good service. Right across the road from Gloucester Road station. Front desk were helpful.  I also used the gym which is unmanned but has the basic equipment you'd need.   Overall, it wasn't overwhelming or WOW!, but I'll definitely return. Good value for a London hotel and has everything you'd expect from a Crowne Plaza. 
2; The Hotel hosted our Christmas Lunch for 100 personnel and we cannot fault it. Everything works so well, the room, the tables beautifully decorated, the food and the service, we cannot fault the day, thank you again for all the hard work put into this to make it such a success 
2;We got a great deal through Travelzoo and are so glad we went although we did think twice about it beforehand because the weather forecast was not good.  We stayed in a Porth Veor beach view villa (not to be confused with the Beach House). The villa was excellent, very clean, nicely furnished with a view of the beach, a small garden & balcony and our own parking space. We had asked for somewhere quiet and this was perfect.   On our first night we tried their restaurant (Beaucliffes) in the hotel’s conservatory. It was so good we ended up having all of our breakfasts and evening meals there.   The hotel and apartments have free wifi but unfortunately our villa (12) was just out of range to receive it so we had to go into the hotel whenever we wanted access. Not a huge deal but it would have been useful to search for things to do on a rainy day without having to go out into the rain to do it.  The location was good with the beach nearby and it's a pleasant walk into Newquay (although Newquay itself is not for us). We were also hoping to do the coastal walk in the other direction to Watergate Bay and to eat at Jamie Oliver's 15 restaurant but unfortunately the rain prevented us from doing that. The National Trust properties Trerice (5 miles) and Lanydrock (20 miles) are well worth a visit and the Screech Owl Sanctuary is 8 miles.   We will definitely return when the weather has improved. The staff were so pleasant and helpful and we loved the setting. Many guests are return visitors to the hotel and villas and I can completely understand why.
2; Stayed for 2 nights and had a lovely stay. The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Bedroom very comfortable and quiet, plenty of room and spotlessly clean. Cooked breakfast very tasty. Would highly recommend if staying in Sheffield and would definitely return 
2; I have stayed at this hotel before, its the most reasonably priced hotel in the centre. I stayed here on business with 3 colleagues. Breakfast was really nice, plenty of choice and the staff very friendly. Bar staff were very friendly, good seection of drinks.  Good checkin / checkout experience. Remember to get your car parking ticket validated for the discount.  The room decor is very nice, only down side is the tram noise in a morning. I would definately stay again. 
2; We were part of a wedding party and had booked a superior room for our overnight stay. Our room was a brilliant size overlooking the grounds of the house. Please note the rooms do not have air conditioning which was unpleasant on a very hot day and night. Throughout the day there was a constant flow of drinks to keep the guests happy, food was delicious considering they are serving on mass. The toast master was great who stayed with us throughout the day until the evening. He kept all the guests updated. Anyone looking to have a grand wedding with lovely interior and excellent views this is the place to book!! Wifi isn't great it never seemed to work but I know other guests didn't have the same problem. 
2; We spent two nights here over the valentines weekend. It was really easy to find from Ealing Common tube station- maybe about 10 min walk max. We had a deluxe room which has a huge bed but yes the room is a bit small. I found it cosy but my hubby was a bit disappointed. If you walk about 15 mins down a straight road you will end up in the Ealing Broadway area with tons of great places to eat, supermarkets and shops. It seems very busy there even late at night.  The hotel has great transport links- we were able to get a bus just across the road that took us all the way to the Wembley Designer Outlet!   The breakfast was alright but it can be really hard to get the attention of the staff members. They don't give you teapots so for a refill of tea or coffee you need to stop someone to ask them which can be a bit tricky. Also if you are veggie, you again need to find someone to ask for veggie sausages and then wait awhile for them to be cooked. The pancake machine redeemed them though- so incredibly awesome to get pancakes plus honey and maple syrup available. But beware! keep an eye on your pancakes being made because some folks might try to steal yours if you look away.  Had an issue with a door being repeatedly opened and slammed shut on 2nd morning- I think it was a staff door but the noise started at around 8am which disturbed my sleep. We did complain and got complimentary coffee and tasty Doubletree cookies to take with us on our journey home- really cute gesture :) 
2; I stayed here with a friend in February 2013. We spent one night here and didn't partake in breakfast.   Positives: - Very friendly and attentive staff - Fabulous location, it's incredibly close to Holborn tube station - Good amenities close-by (Starbucks 2 mins away) - Comfortable bed - Our room had a kitchenette, with a grill, fridge, kettle etc - Clean - Reasonably priced for London - Nice modern looking décor - Quiet (I only woke up once in the night)  Negatives: - We requested a twin room, but were given a double bed - No biscuits, no hot chocolate and a tiny amount of milk given with the teas/coffees etc  Overall, very pleased...would stay here again 
2; Room was excellent with modern hi tec features. Facilities at the hotel was also a bonus. Little disappointed with evening meal which although excellent quality was lacking in quantity. I had stuffed chicken and had 3 small circular pieces which i thought was not enough. 
2; I picked this hotel more for location than anything else but myself and my sister enjoyed our stay. The room was clean, the beds comfy and although there were no windows this was actually a good thing as it was lovely and quiet. We botn slept very well. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The breakfast was a continental breakfast but very much enjoyed. Fresh fruit, toast, croissants and great coffee. All in all great value for money, would definitely stay there again. 
2; Stayed here for one night. Great location walking distance to the train station and shops. Check in was stress free. Very quirky rooms, comfy beds. Would of been nice to have a bath in the room. My partner had the best nights sleep he's had in ages. Check out was at 12 so enough time to have a lay in and we even managed to squeeze in some time for a bit of retail therapy. Would definitely stay at this hotel again. 
2;Just spent a lovely 2 night break here and had a lovely time the receptionist when we arrived was really cheerful and explained everything to us meal times etc even down to the fire drill had a lovely room not much of a outlook but it was lovely would not complain about anything evening meals were superb so was the breakfast all staff were friendly we would definitely go back
2; I recently stayed at Hanbury Manor on a 2 day course. Hanbury Manor were informed of my dietary needs along with my food allergies.  I am a veggi with a severe fish allergy !  On the first day - mid morning snack they served up salmon on soft cheese - not a problem for others in my team but for me a big no no ! when I ask what they would be supplying for the veggi option they hadn't taken that into account - any ways they did finally bring me some thing to eat ........... a ham and cheese toasty ,,, yep they gave ham to a veggi.  It gets better: for lunch they provided every fish under the sun even to a smoked fish quiche, they filled the room with fish where some one has a severe fish allergy .... the mind boggles ! again asking them what was the veggi option they again hadn't taken that into account.   2nd day: thinking they had learnt a lesson or 2 from the day before: they bought in a mid morning snack of ................ bacon sandwiches again not a problem if your a meat eater .. when asked what the veggi option was again I was met with nothing ..... they did supply egg rolls in the end !   FLIES !!!! don't get me started on the amount of flies and watching them crawl all over the food, not only what was being provided in the meeting room but also in their restaurant .... when I mentioned this to them they said it was a big problem and there was nothing they could do .......... errr YES COVER THE FOOD !!! 
2; Although we had a 'deal' with Travel Zoo for one night stay with 3 course tasting menu, glass of wine and breakfast, our experience was really, really good. First impressions, staff very welcoming, the hotel very relaxed in a beautiful spot right by the dunes. Rooms well equipped although little small - would have preffered a slightly larger bed, but ok within the size of the room. The food was outstanding, as was the service. Felt 'tucked up and cosy'! Breakfast was great, full of flavour and well presented. Will certainly return. 
2; The food and service was of a high standard. Enjoyed the carvery selection. Unfortunately due to other events at the hotel, I felt that the Jazz music was over shadowed. It was such a lovely trio. Enjoyable day overall. 
2; I love the rooms in this hotel, especially the family rooms or suites where you get the additional sofas to relax.   It's always been a pleasure staying here. Clean soft comfortable beds.   The buffet lunches are the best and you don't need to be a guest to enjoy them.   Great hotel, nice staff - good value!! 
2; Recently won a 3 course meal for 2 including wine, so went to the restaurant with my husband to celebrate our wedding aniversary. The service was really good, nice friendly staff. A good choice on the menu and the food was really nice. I would definately eat there again, and maybe next time stay over 
2; I chose this hotel because of favourable Tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed. Our standard double room was a good size with a massive, comfortable bed and quality bedlinens. The bathroom was also very good - spotless & well kitted out with toiletries, fluffy towels and a powerful shower. The buffet breakfast was plentiful, varied and of a pretty good standard. My husband particularly liked the porrridge which he said was delicious!  The location of the hotel is not what you would call central, but it's a maximum 5 minute walk to the Tube which gets you into town in about 20 mins. I think the room rate was good value (£128 a night for bed and breakfast for 2 adults and 1 child on a Family Package) perhaps because it's not bang in the centre of things, but the more central Marriotts were much more expensive and (for us, anyway) the location was not a problem at all.   What impressed me most about the hotel was the staff - friendly and welcoming at all times, they really helped to make our stay enjoyable. In a city where indifferent service is quite common, the high standard of service here really stands out. 
2; Efficient & effective check in, Business Class amenities explained to us and room keys give, nice room on 4th floor overlooking the river/Cathedral. Only problem, it was 1 kingsize bed (we were 2 friends travelling together), back down to reception, no problems in getting another Business Class room with twin beds. This room overlooked the roofs at the side of the hotel and the car park, would have been nice having the lovely view! Spacious room with plenty of wardrobe/cupboard space, a small office and seating area. Large bathroom. Good selection of movies and TV channels. Small fridge that was useful for chilling water/soft drinks that we purchased in the town. There was not a mini bar, however, wasn't an issue for us.  The wi fi was efficient and good speed too (we didn't experience the same problems others have noted)  Managers Reception at 5.30pm - 7pm was very poor, 1 choice of each white/red/rose wine (not good or nice wines either) or beer/soft drinks.... any other place I have stayed with Evening rinks Receptions/Package have had a greater variety of drinks available, also, there were no snack/canapés either. Service was good on the Fri evening as it was much quieter, however, Saturday evening we had to queue for a while to get a drink from the bar.   Breakfast was good, great selection of foods and replenished frequently, took a while to be served coffee tho!  Pool was nice,also, towels were available from Gym reception and Gym was well equipped.  This hotel is ideally situated, would I stay here agin? possibly, although I doubt I would pay for the Business Class rooms/package 
2;Lovely hotel. I visited with my two children and paid extra for a Superior Premium Room. My children loved the opaque glass in the bathroom! Really pleased that the bathroom was spotlessly clean. The room was nice, but we were disappointed not to have a 'room with a view'. That would have really made the stay special. I do have a slight niggle. Why are the mattresses not covered with mattress protectors? (Room 523) I discovered this at bedtime but we had unpacked and I had two exhausted children who just wanted to go to sleep, otherwise I would have mentioned this to reception to see whether we could change room. I didn't mention the problem to my children but I spent the night wondering whose bodily fluids I was laying in. Not pleasant! I would expect better from a 4* hotel.
2; My husband and I were bought a champagne afternoon tea by my parents for our 1st wedding anniversary. The hotel is very well maintained inside with tasteful decor and nice finishing touches. The staff were pleasant and attentive. The food itself was tasty and sufficient although I have had more elaborate and excessive afternoon teas elsewhere for the same money. We were offered more cream/jam/tea if we'd wanted, which we didn't but the quantity of scones/sandwiches isn't as plentiful as Bovey Castle or Endsleigh Hotel, both places I would rate above the Salcombe Harbour Hotel. Having said that, this is still a decent feed! The view is somewhat spoilt by the unattractive flat top roof outside the restaurant area but that is not the fault of the staff, more the owners! We were allowed to park in the hotel car park and leave the car there while we wandered into Salcombe after our afternoon tea which was a welcome touch. The reception area and toilets are clean and sparkly, with a fire and comfy sofas. Lovely hotel but not so good that I'd go again. 
2; A very pretty hotel from the outside. Arrived and parked in the hotel car park, slightly odd as reception is based at the back of the hotel and is very small. Reception doubles as a bar, therefor we had to wait quite some time before we were acknowledged. We arrived after 2 as the reservation stated rooms not available until 2, to be told our room was still no ready, so a little annoyed as wanted a short rest after a drive. Got instructed to go to Waddesdon and they would out our bags in our rooms, so not time to get anything we made of needed for the afternoon from our bags as they were whisked away. Returned to the hotel about 5 after a walk around the grounds of Waddesdon, there was wedding go out at this time, but we were shown to our room (after walking across the back of this wedding). I had ordered a bottle to be in out room on arrival for my boyfriend’s birthday – no bottle was there, so I had to phone down and ask for it, ruined the surprise for my boyfriend. The bags looked like they had been dumped on the floor, mine was upside down. The room was at the front of the hotel on the top floor. Request a lower floor if you have mobility issues as the stairs to the top floor are very small and tight. We did not experience any road noise, the room was very spacious and very pretty. The bed was extremely comfortable and to room was warm. I would stay again as my complaints are very small and the overall stay was very good. 
2; Nice hotel, good food, room we managed to book as late booking was furthest from anywhere especially hard when pushing a wheelchair. The chef did me proud with a lactose free diet even to surprise puds! Not impressed with the entertainment the guest entertainers were not great and as for the teams 'piano greats' got lost as to where the piano came in. Rooms very comfortable and staff all very friendly and helpful 
2; My 3 friends and I had a 2 x double room for a hen night as we wanted a room we could all stay in together for getting ready etc. we had a great time, we stayed 2 nights, the room was a good size, clean and had everything we needed. We used the hotel bar both nights and it was really nice, although public (with doors out onto the street) so nowhere quiet to have a drink. The street was also very loud when we went to sleep but we did have the window open so we could have reduced the noise by closing it. We would definitely use this hotel again. All I would say is that to get the extra star we didn't have any help up to the room. We were offered help by the check in staff which we gratefully accepted, we loaded our own bags onto a trolley as everyone was busy and then stood and waited for 10 minutes, at which point (after a 4 hour drive up) we just wanted to get into the room so we took it up ourselves. 
2; A friendly welcome, and a beautiful old, traditional English pub in a setting that is too good to be true. Lacock feels untouched by time even though it remains a thriving village, doubtless helped by the film crews who are often around. The room was fine, rather spoilt by the lack of a cover on the bed base, which seemed a strange oversight. Food was average, but plentiful. Come for the surroundings, and enjoy. 
2; This would rate as a five star but the reason for only four is because we asked and paid for a sea view we got a sea view but also looking at building works as well .I do think we should have been told also on the third floor with no lift .this was awkward as we had a disabled person with us ,Now the hotel was clean ,staff very helpful really was first class apart from the building works and no lift to the bedrooms . 
2; We stayed here this past weekend as treat to ourselves. Our double room was very spacious, clean, tidy and had everything you would need for a stay of one or 2 nights. Our room was in the Garden Cottage where a function was being held. This said, we heard no noise from the party at all during the night. The room was quite warm but a fan was provided, an upgrade of an air con unit would help for Summer months but it was bearable.  We chose eventually to eat in Oakes Grill the menu was very simple with little options for a fussy eater however my husband and I both ordered the Hanbury Burger and it did not disappoint, it was in fact one of the best burgers I have ever had. Food and drinks is on the expensive side but we were there for a treat! In the morning we made use of the swimming pool facilities, this is a lovely area very peaceful we may have timed it right! I can imagine if you were using the full spa facilities it would be great! Our room rate included breakfast which was handy as it was £20 per person, however the it was a very good breakfast with lots of options!The grounds and house are lovely and well kept and great to wander around. The only downside was the pricey cocktails were not made particularly well one was pure sugar however this could have been a fluke! We would definitely come back again even if only for the Burger! For little bit of Luxury for a get away it was perfect. 
2; I stayed here on business for an award ceremony which was held in one the hotel function room which that and the bar area was decorated well. I was also impressed with the meal. My hotel room was nice and clean however the water when using the shower was only luke warm and the shower curtain caused a few mishaps with it laying the the bath tub which at times cause a trip hazard with being slippy. I didn't care for breakfast so cannot comment, all in all, nice hotel in central Leeds. 
2;Stayed at the hotel for 1 night for my sister's hen do. We went to the zoo and checked into the hotel in morning and stayed overnight. The room's were of a good size and had everything we needed in there. The rooms are slightly outdated but other than that they were comfortable.   The staff were very accomadating, and were always happy to help. I didn't see one member of staff without a smile on there face..   The Reception gentleman John was very helpful and the manager was very helpful.   The spa facitilies were OK and we enjoyed the use of this.
2; The room was quiet, clean, comfortable with plenty of space. A late night menu was available with a good choice for breakfast. The staff were very pleasant and helpful.You need to use the shuttle bus from Terminal 5 to the hotel, if you go by Airport Black taxi it will be very expensive as the hotel is located outside the London price boundary. Local taxis from the hotel are much cheaper as they are not bound by this price rule. 
2; The imperial is a gorgeous, grand, comfortable hotel. Ignore the first impression which is a bit plain and run down. Once inside you'll appreciate the chandeliers, the wide corridors and just a general feeling of old fashioned class. Your welcome is warm and the reception is organised and friendly. We had a sea facing room - really good size, comfy huge bed and a large lovely shiny bathroom, found it all spotlessly clean. It was our 2 nd visit and both rooms were fab. The views from the restaurant, rooms and bar are beautiful. We sat having a nice cold glass of wine after evening meal looking across the whole of torbay - stunning! Drink prices a bit steep, but not unexpected in a four star hotel in such a setting. Bar staff friendly and efficient and fun! The one area where improvement is needed is the restaurant- on the first night they did not have our booking, did not matter as seated us no problem, but was sign of things to come... The issue was the wait! Both nights service very slow, and disjointed. Staff seemed overwhelmed, maybe not enough of them? Some were polite and enthusiastic and keen, some not looking so happy in their work! Food took ages to come out, it's a set menu, it should be ready to serve at kitchen level. You were given a bread roll, 10 mins later Your order was taken, another 20 mins a bowl of soup.... and so it carried on! It was just annoying to have to call someone over to ask to get a drink, they are waiters - they should be watching their tables. On 2 nd night we waited 40 mins for our main course, eventually we asked someone - they said ' your order did not get through, some mistake with the computer ' just poor I think and embarrassing for us, we felt like going elsewhere but it was awkward. Our meal arrived after and was okay, the portions are very small please note! Trendy eating I know. We did not see the glass of bubbly which was included In the deal we booked either night and did not want to ask.  They did give us a complimentary drink to compensate for the error with meal.  Staff need major training, as the previous reviewer said - Gordon Ramsey style! They seem inexperienced, but even then someone needs to take control and guide them. And once you get good well trained staff, value them, keep them? Moving on. ... Breakfast was fine, great choice, replenished regularly and hot. Anything you fancied, hot and cold and help yourself We walked through the hotel grounds And noted they are well kept. The pool looked nice, plenty people using it. The hotel is in great position for all that torqusy has to offer. I think if restaurant service were to improve to the 4 star level expected then this hotel should be no 1 on trip advisor not the poor number 55 it currently is, if I was the owner / manager I would not rest until I was there, at the top of the pile, the grand old imperial deserves it! 
2; I must say, Not sounding rude, the area the hotel is in itself isn't one of the nicest I must admit. Only wishing I had read on a review before I booked! The hotel itself is lovely! Incredibly nice. As I work for a holiday inn myself,the welcoming for me and my boyfriend was exceptional even receiving a cheeky free Starbucks each! Which I really appricated. Stayed for two nights and no hassle through out the whole stay. Apart from awaking from a nap with a member of staff coming into our room with room service! But no fault, would recommend. 
2; Hotel was well placed for both tube/ walking. The room (twin) was small but very comfortable. The common areas of the hotel were impressive (although building works ongoing when we were there) but the room and upstairs corridors were a bit shabby and could do with a lack of paint/ touch up. That said, the service was great, the breakfasts were great, it was quieter at night than other hotels have been. The gym was small for such a large hotel, but adequate for the traveller's requirements (!). There were a lot of North African/ middle-eastern type eating places all around if you wanted to eat locally. Overall, we were really pleased with our choice. 
2; My boyfriend and I stayed here twice, in July and Early August. The hotel is very convenient for the tube and in a nice location close to plenty of good restaurants.  The Room was clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and the complimentary breakfast was good. I was particularly impressed with guest toiletries provided in the bathroom, especially as a vanity kit was also provided which so many hotels seem to miss out. The one thing that I feel could have been improved was the hairdryer which wasn't particularly powerful.  Overall we had a really pleasant stay and would definitely return. 
2; Me and my boyfriend stayed here in sometime in March just as a quick get away - and we got a good price from secret escapes so thought - why not?!  We got to the hotel around 12:30pm - when we wasn't supposed to check in until 3pm but the receptionist was fine with this - she had checked our room was clean so let us go up. Which was really good for us.  The hotel itself is very moden, clean and welcoming. Our room was a standard room, which was again very clean and nice - just a little on the small side but for the money we had paid we couldnt complain.   We had dinner and breakfast in within the deal - both of which were both really nice.  The location is ok - we went and had a look around the shopping centre which is pretty much opposite the hotel which was good to have a little walk around. There is a cinema in the shopping centre too if you fancied getting out.  Overall it was a nice one night get away. 
2; We had a lovely day in Bournemouth this hotel was in the perfect location just a short stroll from the gardens and shops. We arrived early and our room was available but not quite ready but they allowed us to use the rooms facilities and finished whilst we were out. It wasn't explained to us that you needed to get towels for the pool at reception so had to get clothes back on to go find towels. Our room was large and comfy. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment i opted to have cooked and the potato and sausage were very peppery which overpowered the taste of the rest of my breakfast so much so i couldn't finish it. The desk staff were friendly and helpful. 
2; Stayed here for 2 nights end of May for our 42nd wedding anniversary. Got a special deal. Room very nice and comfortable and clean but a bit on the warm side during the night as the hotel still had heating on winter rate. However staff said they would fix it. Not their fault really as the English summer decided to put in an appearance for the weekend. Only downside was service at dinner-very slow so food cold when it arrived. To be fair they apologised. Would stay here again but not bother with dinner. 
2;" My boyfriend and I visited this hotel for Valentine's. We added a meal to our room and were contacted 24 hours before the stay to be told their was a website mistake and we shouldn't have been able to add the meal to our stay. The management didn't take this as a big deal or make it seem like it was an inconvenience to us. Luckily my partner and I were able to find somewhere else in Highcross to eat, but this could have been a disaster considering it was a busy night. The room itself was gorgeous; it was very clean and spacious (we went for a deluxe room). The bed was massive, the shower and bathroom were lovely and the toiletries provided were also very nice. In the morning we had a lovely continental breakfast (the hot menu options were a little pricey ...) and they had a wide variety of juices, granola bars and homemade muffins, and bread and cheeses. We went up a few times and all in all were very happy with the food provided. I would definitely recommend this hotel; we were a young couple (university age) and we had a few worries that we wouldn't be taken seriously or would be looked down upon slightly. This was not the case at all, we were treated like any other customers and were treated with the utmost respect. All in all a lovely visit, expensive but definitely worth it because of the massive room and luxurious bed! "
2; Initially I was going to book the Macdonald Windsor Hotel however I was put off by the fact that parking cost £30 and my friend and I were both taking a car so £60 seemed a little excessive for a 1 night stay! I then found Savill Court who have FREE car parking and a spa - perfect for a relaxing weekend with a good friend of mine. It was my birthday and we were upgraded to an executive twin room - not huge but separate bath/shower. The hotel is in a great location, a few miles outside of Windsor and whilst we didn't venture out I can imagine that you can experience some lovely country walks during the warmer months. There is a local pub approx ten minutes walk down the road (I only know this as I got lost on my way!). Hotel is very clean, staff are polite and the price was very reasonable for B&B and Dinner - dinner was good with lots of choice and the self service breakfast was a good standard and again with lots of choice. We used the spa, fab swimming pool - immaculately clean. Would definitely stay again, great place to stay for a girlie weekend or with a partner - not really a place to take kids unless you are looking for accommodation in the warmer months and going to Legoland!! 
2;My daughter and I decided on a day spa treat. Weve had treatments before so knew what to expect. The morning wasn't great as apart from swimming and a very hot sauna there weren't many places we could sit. All the loungers around the pool had towels on them even though there wasn't that many people in the pool! So sat on a chair feeling very hot & uncomfortable from the pool.(2 days later Ive gone down with a sore throat and cold!) The treatments we had were wonderful and staff very friendly. I would say the table where you put your face in a hole was nice and wide but could do with more padding around the face. My daughter had problems focusing all evening after her treatments and had to drive home which was a bit scary. Food was great but the plates were whisked away as the last fork full was going into our mouths! I would go there again but not for a full day just the treatments as we left feeling a lot better.
2; Such a beautiful hotel in the middle of busy sutton. Lovely reception greeting and directions where to go. Lovely to look around this hotel again as our daughters wedding was here six years ago and its still as stunning. Anyway, afternoon tea, we were fortunate with the weather so had a table out on the sun terrace. The tea menu soon came with a huge choice of teas. My husband had fresh coffee soft drinks are also available. Firstly came the sandwiches, brown and white bread, salmon, egg and cress, ham and mustard and cheese and cucumber. All tasty and beautifully presented. No rush to serve u quickly a nice pause and we were asked if we wd like the cake stand. Absolutely gorgeous aray of cakes scones cheesecake. A really lovely tea would happily recommend to everyone !! 
2; Stayed here last weekend, when we first walked in I thought it looked great, one of the best lobby I have been in, but our room was not nice, the air conditioning was rubbish, as it was the hottest weekend that London had all year, we really needed the air conditioning unit, the out look of our window was a brick wall with no view,the bed needs replacing my husband said the springs was in the way, my pillow was so thin it was a waste of time, their was stains on the carpet, the whole room needs up dating including the bathroom, on the plus side the hotel is in a lovely area, plenty of restaurants 
2; We don't normally go for Hotels but as far as this one goes it's very very homely nothing is too much trouble the rooms are spotless the food is excellent the staff are very nice, Mike & Ellena made us feel very welcome in the bar which sold a very good choice of ales if you can fit anything more in after the meal, we will be back to see the dining room when it is all finish but that made no difference to the breakfast as that was excellent in the smaller dining room 
2; Stayed with friends and really pleased with the room & facilities.  Great shower. Comfy bed. Friendly staff. Good breakfast offered. Would recommend, as well as return. Outside looks just the ticket for the summer. 
2; We've stayed at The Queens a couple of times now and just had another lovely stay. The staff are absolutely exceptional so well done to whoever is in charge of recruiting and training these staff to such a Hugh standard.  Our room, whilst dated, was charming and exceptionally clean - great city view too.  We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment. The best bit is the hotel's fab location - handy for everything going on in Leeds.  We'll definitely be back at some point in the future . 
2; I stayed at the Mint Hotel on 16th and 17th November 2011. The hotel is very new looking and extremely modern. The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable.  The technology included an Apple Mac TV incorporating a computer. This would have been excellent if the picture didn't freeze so often.  The food was excellent but perhaps a little on the pricey side for some dishes.   For the ladies (and maybe some men!) it had the best hairdryer I have ever found in a hotel. I would highly recommend it and for me it would have had 5 stars if not for forgetting to put out shampoo and conditioner on the first night!  I have used Jury's in the past but this beats it hands down for a good night sleep and location. 
2; Great hotel in beautiful surroundings - huge bedrooms and bathrooms particularly the rooms overlooking the golf course. Polite, helpful staff at the reception and in the restaurant - Excellent all round! 
2; We went here on a Groupon deal - £89 for one night, dinner, bottle of wine, B & B and use of spa, gym and pool area. We really enjoyed it. Staff very helpful, efficient and friendly. Room one of the best we've stayed in on a Groupon deal and had everything you need. Public areas all very nice, including a room with tourist information and free use of the computer and Wi-fi. The bar area was a bit spread out and sparsely furnished, so didn't feel very cosy. I would say this could be improved upon to make for a cosier atmosphere. Food was lovely although the menu for Groupon was fairly limited, as you might expect. The wine on its own would have been £21 so this was very good value. We didn't use the pool area so can't comment. Breakfast was very good - a good range of different food especially the hot buffet. Would definitely recommend. 
2; We booked the hotel through a discount site and received a very good rate for the evening (including breakfast). The hotel was in a great location for both our night out in the city and a short sight-seeing trip/walk we took in the morning - it's 5 minutes to the river and then a short walk to the Houses of Parliament.   The hotel was very clean, modern and welcoming. The guest services teams were very good, with efficient check-in and explanation of the car parking process (be aware that at the time of writing, access to the car park is at the back of the hotel which involves a short drive round. Check-in before you park is my advice to save waiting at the barriers).  The room was clean, tidy and in good condition. Free wifi in the hotel was a great addition as was the iMac in the room which gave free internet access.  Breakfast was good with a reasonable choice however it can be chaotic, with large queues for the cooked food, so be aware if you are in a rush.  Overall - a great hotel and location. We'd be happy to stay again 
2;Stayed via staff discount so cheap, room very small, had to fight the curtain to get into the bed. However staff in bar brilliant. Staff on reception similarly very friendly but took at least more then 1 person to answer each query as so many of them were either trainees or new to post.
2; We stayed here as we had a function at the Hilton and had family staying, so even though it is close to home it was a great location for friends and family coming from both the m3 and m4. The function was very well managed and although the quantity of food could have been better the quality was good. We have had a few functions her over the years and the standards are very good and customer service is great.  I have friends who are gym members too and even though I'm personally not a member my friends are very happy with their membership. 
2;" Our first stay in Lincoln, and we are please we found Doubletree. Warmly and efficiently welcomed (plus a warm chocolate cookie). Room decent size and very clean. Hotel quiet but very central. Car park limited, but we managed to get last space. Food excellent. Not cheap but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We would stay there again!! Only one slight problem. We were given a &quot;Disabled Facility&quot; room. Not really a problem except basin was very low down and I had to sit to wash my hair. "
2; Stayed here for two nights with my husband and grown up daughter. My husband and I had been allocated an executive room but unfortunately the bed was broken....the duty manager kindly upgraded us to a suite and also gave us a complimentary bottle of wine as an apology, they had had a couple of weddings over the weekend and perhaps this was the reason for the damage to the bed!! My daughter also had to ask a member of staff (receptionist) to clean the toilet in her room as it had not been cleaned properly after the previous guests, not what you would expect from this standard of accommodation. Dinner on the first night was very good as was breakfast, we had afternoon tea on the second day which was fantastic, finger sandwiches, lovely scones and lots of little cakes, the best afternoon tea I have sampled. The staff were very helpful but we did feel that during the evening meal on the second night the waitress had to do everything - seat diners, take orders, serve food, clear plates etc, as there was little sign of any other waiting on staff in the dining room until most diners were leaving. There were more staff on duty for breakfast and the head waiter was attentive, friendly and appeared to enjoy his work. 
2; The most striking thing about this hotel is the huge kidney shaped pool with a bar in the middle and tropical plants around, making me feel I'd gone on holiday instead of to a conference! Unfortunately the tropical theme continued into the bedrooms, where the antiquated temperature control made it hard to control the room temperature, resulting in my waking in the night several times as I was too hot. Otherwise the rooms were sizeable but a bit dark, and the bathroom functional but with a rather low (thigh height) sink.  If you are coming here from Central London use the free buses from Hatton Cross station (285, 423 or 555) and get off at Harlington Corner. There are also free buses from the various Heathrow terminals (see TFL's website for details). Don't be ripped off by the Heathrow Hoppa which the hotel promotes. Public buses are free within the Heathrow area which includes the hotel's location. 
2;I was really looking forward to our overnight stay at the Malmaison which on reflection was indeed very nice BUT! It is so dark inside, dark walls, hardly any lighting! You may say well it's trendy, it may well be, but the whole hotel was bathed in a veil of depression and believe me Newcastle can get its fair share of Depressions, rain, wind etcetera. Please, you need to have a balance surely. The suite we had was so comfortable and the view was great, just a bit light! Not to much more would make such a difference. I enjoyed my stay, fab by the river and the quayside is stunning. Please invest in some light bulbs!!
2; Although I was a little disappointed at first as this hotel did not have the same feeling of grandeur that the Novotel in Sheffield has, we soon came to love this place. Children were made to feel so welcome. They loved playing on the computers and wii at the main reception and the pool was child-friendly too. The rooms could have been a bit bigger. As a family of 4 we found it a bit cramped at times. But all in all we were happy, the staff were lovely and we left smiling... 
2; Great location and building. Plenty of choices for veggies. Starter rustic veggie board was lovely (olives could have been better quality) but would suit 3 sharing. Spaghetti main was a let down. Quite cold and not a lot served on a flat plate with rocket salad and balsamic vinegar. Garlic bread was a lovely flavour but very hard. We heard the main waitress ask one of the chefs who had been out to buy something if our spaghetti was done and he said yes ages ago!! 
2; I have been a non resident visitor to The Headland hotel for many years. But as it was a special occasion I did a stopover and it was most enjoyable. I had a lovely room with a panoramic services and a Four Poster bed. Thank you. 
2; Visited the hotel on 2nd April for one night as a couple, perfect little getaway to spend time without the kids! The hotel is set back lovely with great views. We had a warm, welcoming reception but our room wasn't quite ready so we went and sat in the bar and had a drink whilst admiring the views. We were told we would be shown to our room but we ended up having to go and ask when it got to 4 as nobody came by. The bar area also didn't have anyone serving in it so was a little frustrating waiting but when the bartender came he was very attentive. Our room was an executive suite based in a separate building. We had a lush big bed with rose petals sprinkled on, a box of chocolates and champagne chilling for us. Our room also had a lovely jacuzzi bath. We had a three course meal that night which was absolutely delicious and well presented. Worth every penny. Breakfast the next day was delicious but restaurant extremely busy and felt they didn't have adequate staff to keep up with the demands of some people and there were mix ups with seats being given to different parties. There was a lovely Irish waitress who kept all the calm bless her. Would definitely visit the hotel again and recommend to all. Thank you xx 
2;Stayed 1 night in August during the Bournemouth Air Show. Hotel was very busy, but this didn't seem to affect their level of service which was good.  Reception check in was fast and efficient.  Overall good experience, got a free drink from the bar as booked direct on the hotels' own website. Overall good value for money.   Clean comfortable room, very comfy bed. Good pillows, not silly feather pillows that disappear to nothing !  Only criticism is that our room had a thin connecting door which meant we heard the people in the room next door, quite clearly  Good breakfast, although all food is cramped into the same corner of the dining room. Industrial size toaster offering the usual delivery of hot bread or burnt to a cinder.  Would stay again
2; I just come back for a lovely stay at the Billesley Manor. The restaurant and bar staff were excellent nothing was to much trouble. However I wouldn't say that about the spa. I was booked in for two half hour sessions. I arrived in plenty of time had to wait to be taken into the room late ,then I had to wait at least 12 minutes before the facial started. I then went onto have a pedicure which was not very good . Even though the session started late it finished early , so I certainly did not have an hour session more like 45 minutes!! I then had to go back as the nail Polish was not even on very well so I had to go back and ask them to touch them up . Also the pool was freezing and the sauna didn't work . 
2;We booked three rooms via a Secret Escapes deal. This included a taster menu on the evening of the stay.  Firstly, the negatives... The outside seating area could be better, as it was just a couple of tables sat near to the car parking area. Also there was a limited cocktail menu which didn't appear to match what was online on the hotels website. Two very minor details which would not put me off returning.  Now, the positives. We asked for a room with disabled access which was nicely provided. There were six of us travelling and the other two rooms were upgraded due to some problem in the originally booked room. We got two executive suites, Room 11 & 12. Both very different but lovely spacious rooms. Our room had a roll top bath and separate shower, very relaxing.  The taster menu was very nice, one party had asked for vegetarian, and although this wasn't remembered straight away, they advised us of the options as soon as asked. It allowed us all to try things we hadn't before and the presentation was very nice.  The bar staff were excellent, offering advice on different drinks they offered and being very patient with us all selecting something different!  The atrium area is a lovely place to relax or meet up with your guests if you are travelling in a group. Nice, quiet and airy.  As we were travelling for a family celebration, we provided a cake which the staff happily stored for us and presented at the end of the meal. Nice touch.  All in all, a pleasant experience. Not sure I would pay the full price of the hotel, but on the offer we had with Secret Escapes it was well worth the money.
2; I treated my partner to a surprise stay at the Monkey Island Hotel for his birthday and what a treat! Spectacular grounds, beautiful Regency buildings completely surrounded by the River. Rabbits, squirrels, ducks and peacocks have made the island their home and it was fabulous to gaze out of the window and see them in the grounds. We had a garden view room, but could see glimpses of the river. True - £100 a night can get a room in a contemporary hotel somewhere, but I doubt you would have the same fantastic views and air of tranquility that this hotel provides and this is what you clearly pay for. I would agree that the rooms are in need of updating. The decor is very 1980s and could do with being bringing up to the 21st century, but the room was spotlessly clean and with such a wonderful setting why would you want to stay in your room?  I think the breakfast facilities must have changed since some of the other reviews on here. The room we ate in looked like it had been recently refurbished. Again spotless with crisp white linen tablecloths. Breakfast was made to order...I had kippers with poached eggs (cooked to perfection!) and my partner had the full English which was piping hot (not left to keep warm in dishes). We didn't have dinner in the restaurant - would recommend the Riverside Brasserie at Bray Marina (a 10 minute walk away) which was a superb dining experience. Somewhat difficult to find, but the staff happily showed us how to get there - again, would disagree with some of the other comments on here which said the staff were rude, but I suppose you take as you find.  All in all an unforgettable experience, perfect for a relaxing break away from it all. 
2; Went to stay at this hotel for two days after receiving a phone call into buying into a holiday plan the presentation lasted 3 hours and must admit was wondering if we'd ever get to the price this was not for us the idea and concept was good but as we told Nigel  Buse our rep we met who was a nice man and very informative and covered everything we asked about at the moment had other commitments the grounds are beautiful pool jacuzzi breakfast was brilliant evening meal we found was lovely I have read other reviews and can only say couldn't fault the food and staff were very friendly and helpful  Best cream tea I've had for a long time !! There was nothing I could find fault with in this hotel just as its a bit secluded you do need a car to go out and about !!! 
2; This is a good hotel in a lovely position, we had fantastic sea views from the balcony of our room. The majority of the hotel is in a very plush decorative order however the swimming pool facilities were looking a little tired (the indoor pool and spa were lovely and warm though). The hotel staff were friendly, helpful and very pleasant. The full english buffet breakfast was fantastic, served hot and fresh with lots of choice. 
2;" Had a two night night stay at this hotel 4/5 December. I was keen to stay here instead of the other hotel on my employers &quot;official hotel list&quot; as I have had the great pleasure to eat at Michael Caines restaurant at Gidleigh Park Hotel, Dartmoor.  Pleasant reception staff whilst checking in. I was allocated room 302, third floor facing the front of the hotel; very clean and tidy room, however a little small for my liking. Think my room was at the budget end of the range of rooms. The room was very hot, despite it being a very cold day. I turned the radiator off, but because of the exposed heating pipes, the room stayed warm - too warm for me ! Huge windows with secondary glazing, and I discovered that if I opened the secondary panel, it was just like opening a window !  Despite the hotel being situated on a main street, it wasn't too noisy. Very conveniently situated near the Arndale Shopping Centre, trams and Piccadilly Station.   I can high recommend the room service breakfast, which was on time and excellent ! Choice of a breakfast, bacon or sausage roll, which turned out to be a huge baguette, plus cereal, fruit and a pot of tea.   Helpful staff in the bar and bistro restaurant and the Australian Shiraz was just what I needed ! "
2;My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights(May BH weekend). It is a perfect loctaion for a visit to Stratford, just across the river from the RSC theatre. The bedrooms were very clean and comfortable. Our room overlooked the courtyard and only had a shower. If you want to dine at the restuarant it's advisable to book as we had to wait for a table to become available. The beer garden is across the road, but has excellent views of the river and we spent a happy hour watching the boats. Breakfast was adequate, but the young staff are lacking in the required skills to provide a good service. On each occasion we received our food before the drinks as the staff had to be reminded that we required tea!
2;" I use this hotel preferentially when staying close to Heathrow and always find the staff pleasant and attentive. On this occasion, I was told at check-in that I was being upgraded - always a nice thing to hear. However, my &quot;upgrade&quot; was to the standard of room that I normally get, except it was disabled-accessible. It was fine, although it had no desk or dressing table, and to be told it was an upgrade was misleading. The wet room floor was lethally slippery - watch out, disabled users. All in all, though, I had a pleasant stay. The bed was comfy and my room temperature was perfect. The room and the bathroom were spotless. "
2; We stayed here overnight before leaving for an early morning flight. The room was very clean and comfortable. And the staff were very friendly. On the evening we went to the restaurant where I found the meal to be a bit of a let down and a bit overpriced. I would suggest you try the bar meals as an option. But overall a very pleasant start to our holiday. On return to Manchester at 4 am, I asked if we were able to buy a coffee in one of the bars or restaurants. I was told it was all closed for the night, but if we could wait, they would put their kettle on for us. A very nice, thoughtful touch. Well done Bewleys. We will definitely stay there again. 
2;" Great location for accessing football ground with easy access by taxi from railway station. The service was first class; very clean and well appointed. The only small negatives were no table in the room, limited choice of menu and the bed was exceptionally hard. However, would definitely recommend and stay again. "
2; I stayed on Bermondsey square hotel for two days with my partner. We had a double room which was okay but has a weird set up with bed going to the side :)  The suits how ever are wonderfull and some have a jacuzzi with views of the shard so i would definitely pick that one if i was coming to London next one. Petra at the reception was very lovely and explained everything. Staff is polite and doesn't ask too many questions.  Hotel is close to lovely London brifge and has many bars and restaurants around and you can walk over the bridge and in to the chaos of London. Public transport is really close as well.  Con : The only downside is the restaurant service. Dropping orders on the floor, forgeting, asking me if im finished with food when I literally just sat down and put the food on the table. Also every time i asked for water they told me to get it myself instead of bringing it anyways then telling me, i had no need to explain my foot was hurt, i believe when you are paid to do something you do more than that and that makes a great employee. These are the only things stopping the hotel from being a really great one.   Speaking of food:  Menu needs a bit more diversity and the chef should stop putting vinegair in the water to keep poached eggs in shape because that is one of the worst mistakes a chef can make. It tastes like vinegar.  Interesting fact:  Hotel doesn't serve alcohol but has no problem accomodating you with buckets and glasses of you choose to buy your own. Strangley i like it like that.  And in the end :) i like the hotel, it's cute and I didn't feel pressured by the staff at all. Everyone was great and hotel is very clean   Would reccomend :)   Didn't manage to tranfer enough photos from camera to post so no photo proof this time :) 
2; I had a short stay for business in London. The hotel offered me everything I needed for that purpose. My room was clean and warm, very nice on a rainy day, though a bit small. Location of hotel is great, very convenient. 
2;Location great, hotel amazing. Lily suite is so relaxing and beautiful views. Hotel clean. The only thing that lets it down is the staff. Very rude and they don't understand customer service. We stay there very frequent in the Lily Suit but never have we been recognised or welcomed back mentioned. Lost a key card and got questioned and made to feel bad as to why I lost it. Also don't try to check in early as the rooms are never ready. Love hotel and location but staff need a lesson in public relations.
2; Stayed here during business trip to Bournemouth earlier this month. We were on a deal so value for money was excellent, haven't checked what the proper prices are. However, hotel was excellent and the service friendly and efficient. Nothing was too much trouble. The property (and our room) appeared to have been recently refurbished to a very high standard. We dined in the hotel restaurant on both nights of our stay - chosing a la carte on the 2nd night - and all the food we ate was beautiful. The breakfast was especially good - freshly cooked to order which is always preferable to congealed eggs and sausages as in a buffet-style breakfast, I find. We were in a superior room with a balcony overlooking the harbour however, as were were checking out I overheard a gentleman asking what type of room he had been in because he was so satisfied with it he would like to book again in the same quality room - it was one of their basic rooms - so, that would appear to be a good recommendation for their 'standard' rooms. We will use this hotel again next time we are in the area. 
2; Overall a good stay, but the spa staff leave the hotel a bit behind to be honest. If you go for a couples weekend, don't have very high expectations on the spa massages. The food is amazing, specially the steak, just be prepared to pay extra for it if you are in a package like we did. Worth the extra money though. THe staff at the restaurant was amazing too. 
2; I've stayed at the Hilton twice and have loved the experience. The hotel inside is lovely and well decorated. The staff are all polite and helpful. The rooms are really nice, small, but well thought out. The balconies are a nice bonus as they open out to the rest of the hotel and allow good access for smokers. The beds are comfy, the bathrooms are clean and the dining room is spacious. Our package included breakfast, which was delicious. It was a buffet, so definitely great value for money. The atmosphere is lovely, especially when events and conventions are going on. Room service was fast and tasted lovely and the staff were friendly.  I love staying here, but with it being the Hilton it cost us £300 to stay Friday-Monday, besides that it's a lovely place. 
2; Took my mum for afternoon tea as a birthday treat, The sandwiches were freshly made and were very tasty as were the terrific range of cakes and mini desserts we particularly liked the choux pastry swans, we had plenty of tea and coffee too and nothing seemed to much trouble for the staff, also we both took doggy bags home with the cakes we didnt eat , which was nice too, we found the experience very relaxed and we did not feel we had to rush ourselves, on the whole a very nice afternoon, would come again. 
2; Close to Warren street and Euston station. Staff very welcoming and friendly. Room was clean and a decent size. Ordered room service which was reasonably priced. Breakfast room was a little chaotic. I requested a decaf tea, which was stone cold when it arrived as was the breakfast but there was a good selection of other foods, cereals and yoghurt. This would not put me off staying again. 
2;We stayed here for a weekend. The hotel rooms were lovely and decorated well. There is great access to the Mailbox and its range of restaurants and shopping. We thought the location was great for the city centre and there was a high standard in the rooms. Breakfast was lovely as well, cooked to order and a nice buffet spread with healthy options.
2;Nice contemporary hotel, clean sleek lines. Had voucher for lunch at Outsidein restaurant. Food was very nice although slightly hard to understand the menu as was a la carte typefood. I had their Beales burger with fat chips which was delicious. Desert Special board Sticky toffee pudding with ice cream beautifully displayed was yummy. Sering plates were unusual but very nice. Overall a lovely meal not to sure of one the waiters attitude and he did mix up who wanted ice cream or just cream. Receptionist was very polite & helpful as was the barman. Nice outside patio area but no garden.
2; The hotel is very conveniently situated for city centre shopping and is opposite the train station. It is a pity there is no parking but the Q park the hotel advised us to use is only a two minute walk away and you do get a discount. Our room was simple but very clean and freshly decorated. The bathroom was small but well fitted and everything was in good working order. We were very surprised to find the TV was so old and scruffy looking with a very poor choice of channels. The staff were friendly and helpful and we would use the hotel again 
2; We booked a night away for my birthday. Room was clean and very big. Bed was a little hard. Bar prices were reasonable and a nice atmosphere. Spa was a nightmare to get hold of both prior to the trip and on the day. Clean building and close to city centre. You need to pay £8 for parking which is a little steep as the rooms are pricey enough. Asked to pay £50 on credit card only as a refundable deposit which was paid back but it would be nice to be aware of it prior to the visit. We would stay again ! 
2; New stay in Durham after many B and Bs plus other hotels. This is good for parking, quiet venue, cathedral and castle views, business class rooms etc although breakfast buffet a bit mass Market ! 
2; Most impressive spa and golf resort hotel. We stayed with my elderly mother over Christmas. The staff were exceptional. Efficient, delightful and nothing too much trouble. Rooms were comfortable as were beds and pillows. Impressive. 
2; Have never stayed here, but have been here for several business conferences and have always found the catering to be good. Most recently it was a set two course sit-down lunch - miraculously about 120 of us all seemed to be served at the same time. Food was good and hot (very hot plates!) and service very efficient. Water replensihed automatically and specific diets catered for. Exactly what was needed with a full agenda to get through. Parking facilities good too. 
2; The University Arms has a great location and parking ( £16 per 24 hours). It also offers an extensive breakfast buffet and dishes made to order at no additional charge. Coffee at breakfast was excellent compared to the hot water served in other places! The hotel certainly could do with a bit of refurbishment but nothing other than freshening the decor is required. The public areas have old-fashioned grandeur and space but it is in the bedrooms ( at least, if the one we had is anything to go by) that a make-over would help. That said, our room was spacious and clean with a very large and comfortable bed and the sheets changed every other day. We found reception and breakfast room staff very pleasant and helpful. If you can overlook the drab wallpaper and chipped paint, this hotel is good value in every way and we will certainly be booking it for our next stay in Cambridge. 
2;" We have recently returned from a two night stay at Coombe Abbey Hotel which my husband organised for my 30th birthday. We visited with our recently turned 3 year old who was made extremely welcome by all members of staff, unusual in a hotel of this caliber. My husband had briefly mentioned to the booking staff that the trip was for my 30th birthday and the staff had left a birthday card for me, the first of many personal touches by dedicated staff who clearly care very much about the hotel and making guests feel welcome. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds and is exceptionally well maintained. The interior is spotlessly clean and the cleaners are polite and low key, no banging on the door at 7am like I have experienced in other hotels.   There were a few issues that unfortunately prevented me from awarding this lovely hotel a 5 star review, most notably the restaurant. We had booked in for an evening meal at 7.30 pm and were seated promptly. The service, although extremely polite, was painfully slow! We didn't receive our food until 9.20 pm, almost two hours after we sat down!!! We noticed other tables who had arrived much later than us being served their food whilst we were still sitting with menus in our laps waiting for our order to be taken! I notice from other reviews that service in the restaurant seems to be an ongoing problem so I am unsure why the management has not done more to address this matter. That being said, the food when it arrived was lovely.  Also, on checking out on Sunday I noticed empty cans of Fosters lager discarded in the bushes at the front of the hotel, had I been the bride and groom who were celebrating their wedding that day I would not have been too happy having the remains of last nights party in the background of my wedding pictures!  Overall, I was very impressed with this hotel, it's locality and it's staff. I would like to make a special mention of a few members of staff who went the extra mile to make us feel welcome; Michelle on reception who was extremely polite, professional and knowledgeable and made our son's day by giving him a Little Lord Coombe teddy bear to take home with him which he has not let out of his sight since. The gentleman who took over our service in the restaurant on Saturday night (I think his name was Stefan? He did mention he had a 3 year old son if this helps to identify him) And Tammy, who served us breakfast both mornings, she was welcoming and friendly and made a fuss of my little boy, giving him a bag of bread to feed the ducks with. These staff members are a credit to their employers and I hope they are truly appreciated.  I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anybody and look forward to visiting again. Just a few tweaks to dinner service and it would be almost perfect! "
2; Great modern hotel, bar & restaurant with welcoming, friendly & attentive staff. On arrival, management were more than happy to send glasses & an ice bucket to our room for a bottle of champagne we had brought with us. Nice modern rooms, very comfy beds, spotless, sparkling bathrooms. Slippers & robes provided. Early in the evening we found a small leak in the bathroom (these things happen). This was attended to immediately by the manager herself and within 10 minutes we were given a room upgrade with a complimentary bottle of wine. An excellent example of how it's not the problems that matter but the way they are dealt with that counts. Nice contemporary bar with reasonably priced drinks & good tapas. Well located for central manchester, walking distance to bars, shops etc. Only slight negatives: Priority club members get late check out til 12pm (2pm in some other CP hotels). No pool & sauna. No discount on £15 car park charge (NCP across the road). Overall, I would say the level of service and standard of accomodation is higher than most other 4 star hotels I have stayed at. Very impressed - would definitely stay again & recommend. 
2;" So it's not a very posh luxurious hotel but then you get what you pay for. I think it's been refurbished recently as it has a bit of a mod feel to it. I've stayed 5 star in loads of places but for the location I don't think this hotel is shabby or bad. I've actually just booked my next stay here again.   It's definitely better than the Hilton at Cobham! The other thing I would mention though is I think there are two parts to the hotel and maybe one part has been refurbished and the other hasn't. Not sure but my room ended up being in the &quot;not so new looking&quot; part and the room was not shabby. However the hotel has a nice feel when you walk into the lobby. The breakfast was really good too. Got vouchers for breakfast - £9 per person and free for my 4 yr old. Again I would say not bad for the Hilton standards so give it a try. There was a trainee girl at reception who was really helpful - I think her name was Aisha.  Lastly, there were signs everywhere about thieves at the car park! Not sure what had happened in the past so I was a bit apprehensive when we drove in. They were all police signs saying to not leave any valuables in the car. I expected my car to not be there when we came out lol! But seriously, nothing happened and I guess it just made us more careful. There was no noise from the roads as well, had a great night sleep unlike at Cobham. The pool was a bit cold but the sauna and steam room made up for it. Will definitely stay again. "
2; Parkhouse motel is a great place to stay if visiting stone henge or other parts of Salisbury. The rooms are large and spacious, nice size bathroom. The evening meal was excellent really top class restaurant food, I had the belly of pork that melted in the mouth for my main and my friend the lamb shank which the plate was only just big enough to hold. A fantastic nights stay which we will be using again. Only thing stopping me giving top marks was the shower was weak. 
2;" I booked a spa day with a friend via a Living Social deal for a treatment, use of spa facilities and lunch. Unfortunately I was very late (3 hours!) due to there being an accident on the motorway en route. The staff could not have been more accommodating; they served my lunch when I arrived and changed the treatment times so I would not miss out. The spa itself is very relaxing and has good facilities. My only criticism is that there is only small changing room facilities and one shower! However, I would recommend this spa and will be returning. "
2; I stayed here mid week for a business conference at another hotel, and had a single room. Yes, the room was very small however it was well laid out with nice furnishings so for a couple of nights it wasn't a problem. The shower room again was very nice but also very small - fine for me but larger guests may have had trouble! Not sure if this would have been larger for a double/twin room. The walls were quite thin though as I could hear guests in the adjoining room talking quite clearly. Disappointing that there wasn't a restaurant for an evening meal, however there are lots of places to eat close by near Paddington station. Breakfast was nice, plenty of choice. I didn't have any problems during my stay so didn't have much to do with the staff, but they were friendly at check in and check out. I see this hotel being more suitable for business travellers for short stays, not the kind of place I'd go to for a week's holiday or a romantic break. 
2;We were lucky to come on a Groupon voucher with an overnight stay B/B With use of spa and afternoon tea all for £99 for two , so a really fantastic deal and nothing to complain about , however if I were paying full price I would of been disappointed with the spa as the hot rub was outside no indoor tub or pool and the sauna and steam rooms were in the Ladies/gentleman changing rooms so couldn't enjoy the facilities with my partner . The rooms were fantastic, big and beautifully decorated and the shower was fabulous . I didn't get up in time for breakfast but my partner said it wasn't great and I have to comment on the afternoon tea which I must admit wasn't that great , it consisted of Tea/coffee and two tiny scones each ( but that might have been because it was inclusive with the deal). To sum up, the price we payed it was fantastic, so keep your eyes peeled people for an offer on groupon !
2;My boyfriend and I stayed here one weekend in March 2007. We mainly chose it because of the spa description and reviews. We managed to book a standard room for just £65 per night on Hotels.com.  The hotel was easy to find with a large car park. Our room was in the newer wing of the hotel, a few minutes walk down a corridor. The room was fairly nicely decorated, with a new bathroom. The only negative was that we were disturbed by noise from the next door room a couple of times one night, with people shouting and laughing. However, we did not report this to the staff, who were very helpful when we did require anything (e.g.free leftover newspapers, ear plugs). The spa was wonderful - a 50m indoor pool, with indoor and outdoor jacuzzis plus sauna and steam room. There is also a good-sized gym although we didn't use this. The continental/full english breakfast was very good on the morning we tried it, though not cheap! The hotel is only a couple of miles from a village called Heswall, which has several good restaurants. It is close to several viewpoints of/walks along the Dee Estuary (mud flats with lots of birds). Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. 
2; Stayed here from 8th October for 3 nights. Travelled with my Mum and Nan and we all had a single room each. My family have been bringing me here since I have been very little and I must say that I absolutely love the place! First thing to mention is that the dining room / food is amazing, literally the best food. I think the feel to the dining room is so luxurious and relaxing at the same time, fine dining at it's best. Breakfast is fantastic too. Our waiter throughout our stay was called Peter and we found him very lovely and he took great care to make sure we were happy with everything. Yes the rooms are dated but I don't mind that. I stayed in room 114 and I loved the big bathroom. The room was clean, very practical and had a homely feel to it. The gardens are beautiful. The pool is great too. Overall no complaints and I really enjoyed my stay. 114 could do with a new tv though, mine didn't work very well at all, but I didn't go away to watch tv, so I didn't say anything whilst I was there. I will be returning next year for sure, it's like a family tradition for us. 
2; Thanks to Szilvia for great service in the Urban Cafe. Good food, relaxed atmosphere. We had the fish and chips (not too greasy, tasty fish without being overpowering) and the Louisana Chicken burger (very tasty). Nice to have liqueur coffees made well and without canned cream! Lovely evening. Happy holidays and hope to see you all next time. 
2; Just got back from an excellent weekend in London. Stayed here Feb 20 & 21st. Paid £10 to check in early which is 12 instead of 3pm however after paying they allowed us to check in early at 9.15am as they had a room ready. The first room however still had someone else's luggage in. After a trip down to reception we were given another room. The staff on reception very apologetic and friendly and we were just pleased to be able to dump our bags.  Room basic and clean perfect for a short stay. Fantastic location- which meant we could walk home later that night after watching a show. This is the second time I have stayed at this travelodge and will continue to do so as excellent value for money. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel - instead used a little cafe down the road called Wings. The only thing this hotel lacks is a luggage storage room but that's the same with all Travelodges, don't let this deter you though. It's fantastic location more than compensates ! Can't wait to go again !! 
2; Great looking hotel right on the quayside.The reception and surrounding ares are a bit dark,but is quite fitting for a boutique hotel.The reception staff and anyone we came in contact with were at all times friendly and courteous.Our room was absolutely stunning,with views across the Tyne.We had booked bed and breakfast for 2 days but sadly only made it once,which was a big mistake,the choice was great,the service was however a bit slow.Overall my impression was a good one. 
2; Hotel very friendly, rooms ok and very clean with great bedding and towels. We used spa and had a treatment which was lovely. Highlight was the food, evening meal and breakfast were divine. The Italian Resturant manager was very helpful and friendly so a special mention for him. Would recommend 
2; My husband and I went here for a two night break just to relax. The spa is very popular and unfortunately I could not secure an appointment in the salon so if your reason for coming here is the spa, ring them first before you book a room. The setting is in lush countryside and there is a nice walk from the hotel that continues to national trust land. The staff are fantastic and very accommodating. Downsides: no aircon in room and it got very hot. We had to borrow a fan from reception. The food was good but restaurant menu very pretentious and over-priced. Chiboust or bresanne anyone? breakfast was yummy, great selection of healthy and not so healthy food.  Overall, I would recommend Lythe Hill and I look forward to coming back here. They also have lovely Elemis products in the bathroom! 
2; Recently stayed at the Radisson Blue at Heathrow and the team were great. Especially Charlotte Graham Front Office Manager as nothing was too much trouble as despite having huge number of guests checking in, her team were attentive and helpful throughout my stay. They made it all so easy - thank you. 
2; We booked this hotel as a family member was having a wedding at the hotel. We had travelled a long way and were pretty tired when we arrived but lucky enough to be able to grab some food at the bar before heading for bed ready for the busy wedding day ahead. Unfortunately our first night's stay was ruined by some other guests being very rowdy into the early hours, which was no fault of the hotel, they cannot control who comes to stay with them. The night manager was very helpful and made arrangements for the next night so we would not be disturbed by the same group again. The room was great, we enjoyed using the swimming pool once we found it and had a great time at the wedding. Breakfast each morning was very good. I would be happy to stay here again 
2; Stayed at this hotel twice now and both times where excellent. Staff very friendly and hotel clean and stylish. Close to the city centre and 5 min walk away from the docks the location is excellent. Sky tv and a fridge etc available.Tesco around the corner and costa coffee shop up the road. The room was a little hot but air conditioning worked a treat. Well done Hotel Indigo keep up the good work. 
2; We stayed at the Bridge as a treat for my husbands birthday.It was part of a travelzoo deal.The staff were very pleasant and attentive and the food very good.We also took advantaage of the travelzoo offer on the spa deal and also found this a pleasant experience and once again helpful staff.We went to the spa 4.30 on the Sunday and found this ideal as it had quietened down.All in all a pleasant break. 
2; The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, the hotel was well presented , very cosy and clean! Will definitely stay again if visiting Manchester. I stayed in a double room which provided me and my friend with everything that we needed for the evening 
2; Stayed in the Novotel for one night over a weekend, hotel is very central for Leeds city centre only a couple of minutes walk and you are amongst all the shops, bars and restaurants. Room was very spacious and clean. Nice big bed and comfy pillows. TV in room with sky channels, also a mini fridge, hairdryer, Iron and Ironing Board. Bathroom was clean with big towels. and toiletries. Nice bar area, however quite expensive for drinks. Couple of bars near the hotel - one we went to Coast - had a nice atmosphere, we also ate in a nearby Restaurant Nawaab which was a great Indian and really reasonable. I would recommend this hotel if you want a central hotel thats clean and friendly 
2;" Stayed here for works Christmas party. Hotel was very busy. Very impressive and spacious hotel, with a number of bars and some large function rooms. Parking in front of the hotel is practically impossible, most spaces reserved for company exec's and VIP visitors. The walk from the alternative carpark is ok if the &quot;side door&quot; to the hotel is open, otherwise if it is raining you have a 5 minute walk up the road so probably need an umbrella. Finding your way from the side door to the reception is a bit of a mission. There need to be some clearer signs inside the hotel for finding your way around to reception, the bars, restaurants etc. Reception staff were polite enough, mostly Polish, although seemed a bit robotic and impersonal, but that may be because the hotel was so busy. Standard Double Room was excellent, modern, large, spacious, massive double bed, large desk, armchair, plenty of sockets, nice bathroom. Could not fault the room. As the hotel was busy it was not the best nights sleep, people up and down corridors, doors opening and closing, flushing toilets at 4am, but there were some very large Christmas parties going on so that was to be expected really. The next morning I was rather too hungover to be brave enough to sit in a restaurant full of people so unfortunately I cannot comment on the breakfast but our Christmas meal was nice so I'm sure breakfast would be too. "
2; Stayed here on a Friday with the family.  Rooms are clean, staff friendly enough and slept well. Even though we were alongside the road, we weren't awoken by the traffic. You could start to hear it around 9am, which is fine. Walls are a little thin, just because we could hear bits through the walls.  Some areas really could do with a lick of paint and some furniture replacing - where the mini bar used to be, the cupboard was all scracthed etc. Carpets starting to look a little dated.  We could only have a twin room, however we were pleasantly suprised - they had been pushed together and were pretty much like one double.  The breakfast is excellent - honestly, the best hotel breakfast I have had in a long time and the staff are attentive and very friendly. They were great with treating the kids too and even made up a birthday plate for one of our family members.  Only thing that concerned me is the smoke alarm was covered in bubble wrap and a plastic bag? Makes me wonder if previous guests had done that so they could smoke, it needs removing/sorting though.  Would stay again. 
2;The room had regular amenities, tea/coffee, soaps, towels, etc. Good quality furnishings, very classy looking room, it was let down by the beds however. They were incredibly stiff and gave me one of the worst sleeps I have ever had.  This may just be down to personal preference, but me and my friend both agreed that they were not for us.  I can imagine that the views from some rooms are rather nice, as much as London can look nice. We arrived at a bad time though, as there were improvement works going on just by our window which looked out onto the back of the hotel. It didn't affect our comfort however, and we still had the interesting sight of the BT Tower from our window.  The lobby and corridors of the hotel are stunning, decorated in a style which is half modern and abstract and half marble grandeur of a long forgotten time.  Staff were nice, and although we did not take up any offering from the bar/restaurant , it did look like top notch service all-round.
2; I booked Slaley for a quiet relaxing weekend away with the hubby to unwind and refresh.   The hotels best asset is its staff, wow! The service from the start of our long weekend to the finish could not have been more amazing!   We arrived at the hotel around 12.00midday, way too early for check in - but was it? nope, our car was parked for us and we were able to check in straight away with the very welcoming, helpful ladies at reception.   We arrived in our room which was an upgraded executive room, lovely! Although we wished we could have had a golf view rather than the hotel reception courtyard but hay it was quiet, modern, plush and very comfortable. I noticed around the hotel there are some not so modern bedrooms so the trick is if you want a refurbished room pay more and upgrade as I think these tended to be the standard doubles.   We went straight to the spa area, for a hotel spa this was brilliant, juice bar, loungers, huge pool. The only criticism was the lighting by the pool in the day could have been a little better. It was wet and miserable outside and the dull lighting (although relaxing) was a little too dark and made you feel as if someone had forgotten to turn the lights on.   The gym was fine, usual hotel gym but had everything you needed. It would have been nice to see a few more classes perhaps yoga as we love to work out while away - it means we can afford the calories for pudding in the evening :)   We finished at the spa area and went to the bar for a light lunch. The staff here are brilliant - Mahmut and Carl were there for most if not all of our weekend stay. I have never seen two people work so hard with a smile on their face the whole weekend, genuinely pleased to help and serve you a true credit to your hotel. Its these types of people that make your stay welcoming and relaxing. The bar area is great and a lovely area of the hotel plush sofas and seating areas, great relaxing lighting.   On the Friday evening we went through to Hadrian's for dinner, ummm Hadrian's.... what can I say?! Its the only part of the hotel that I feel is lacking! Compared to the rest of the hotel this canteen feeling restaurant lets the side down. Large, open, impersonal, stark lighting, no atmosphere, very dated décor/furniture and serving a Sunday roast on a Friday night! We quickly left our table before ordering and went back into the bar area for dinner instead. With a little love and investment this could be a fantastic restaurant but at present its very below standard from the rest of the hotel.   On the Saturday evening we dinned at the Dukes Grill, one word.... exceptional! The décor, lighting, feel of this restaurant is perfect! Once inside you feel as if your in a swanky restaurant in London not a hotel grill. The menu is pricey but its more of a treat so in turn we felt more then comfortable with the level of service and food to be paying the premium. And the food...... WOW!! We ordered the steak and Lobster and it was unbelievable, I urge anyone to try this as its best steak I have ever had! At £80.00 for two people it sounds a lot but you will be wishing we had a larger waist band when you leave, it is well worth the price tag! Damaciano who was the head of the restaurant made the whole experience one to remember, he was fantastic! Attentive, well spoken, knowledgeable and very welcoming.... I think his service was one of the main parts that made this experience that little more upmarket. Thank you for a lovely evening Damaciano :)   All in all QHotels this was a fantastic stay! The only other improvement I might suggest is perhaps a games room or pool table. If like us it was a wet and miserable weekend, with the hotel being in the countryside I think this would be the perfect asset to have when its too wet to venture out, maybe in one of the lounge areas on route to the bar. 
2; Second time visit for us for the New Years Eve package. Central location....next to the Railway Station. Very attentive and pleasant staff. Good food and entertainment. Have to say the rooms are average but they are clean and comfortable . Have really enjoyed both visits. 
2; My husband and I stayed for two nights June 2013 to experience the golf. All hotel staff very polite and efficient, room was great except for the air conditioning (which seemed to have a mind of its own) but air conditioning, you either love it or hate it!! Lovely view. Golf was great, caddie masters, course marshals fantastic, friendly and welcoming. Both courses very challenging (if you're a high handicapper beware!!!!) but a real pleasure to play on. Breakfast buffet was great, a wide choice of food and extremely efficient service. We ate in the bar in the evenings, food was nice, (plenty of it) and was reasonably priced as were the drinks. Friendly service. All in all we enjoyed our short stay and hope to return in the future. 
2; Got a Great deal through groupon for 2 nites B&B and having tried it, would definitely go back. Great location just few minutes walk from town centre which has a good range of shops and restaurants/bars. Welcoming reception. Lovely contemporary interior, spacious rooms which are well equipped, clean and well looked after. Shame the lift was broken for the duration of our stay as we were on top floor but provided good exercise for us!  We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant and also had dinner in the signature restaurant in the basement which offered a fixed menu of 3 courses for just £19.99. Food was excellent. Disappointed we had to pay for parking as they own the at park - felt it should be included in normal room rates which are upto £140 per night. Also the Internet was non-existent in our room. Other to that loved it and would definitely return. 
2; Excellent and peaceful location near Heathrow and Hampton Court. Delightful gardens and views over local parks. Service and staff helpful. Breakfasts excellent but A La Carte evening meals not good value.  
2;Was staying there and was asked to move down the street by the receptionist to smoke which I thought was kind of patronising and uncalled for as I wasn't offending anyone and I was nowhere near the front entrance
2; We were visiting The Salisbury Playhouse where our nephew was directing a play and decided to stay the night. The hotel was in an excellent position to just park our car and walk to both dinner and the theatre. We found the hotel to have friendly helpful staff and the decor to be clean and fresh. Our only minus point was the lack of lift but found the staff willing to help us carry the cases upstairs. Our included breakfast was excellent and well organised. 
2;Just returning from a 3 night break. Nice hotel in lovely grounds. We stayed in a VIQ room on the 1st floor with a balcony over looking the golf course. Very pleasant if occasionally a bit noisy with doors banging. The food was good and the spa facilities very nice. Would recommend having a massage!! By far the best part of this hotel though was the staff. All the staff from reception, the bar, the restaurant and the spa were lovely. We had a couple of minor issues which were dealt with efficiently and without any quibbling. Staff greeted us in the corridors with smiles and hellos as we passed them and we're all very chatty asking how our day had been and offering advice on trips out, directions etc. Thank you to all the staff. You really made our stay.
2; great value for money weekend. The hotel staff very very helpful and pleasant. rooms were clean, nicely furnished and were well equipped. food dreadful.. over cooked, sloppy, greasy and very unappetising.. 
2; My family and I stayed at this guesthouse for a couple of nights. The rooms were spotless and the hosts were extremely friendly and jovial. We were cooked a hot vegetarian breakfast as we requested.   We would definately recommend this guesthouse as a great value place to stay in Torquay especially in the peak season. 
2; The staff are welcoming, friendly and attentive so instantly made us forget about the long drive to get to Reading between Christmas and New Year! I was relieved that the staff gave us the post code for the Car Park very near by rather than the hotel as it would have meant a drive around the ring road to park!!! Despite the funky, extremely dark decor the hotel has a calm and relaxed feel to it. The bar - lounge area is lovely with its large comfy sofa's, soft lighting and candles in lanterns. The log burner gave warmth and added to festive feel good spirit. Our room was great ,the only criticism the air conditioning system took an age to warm the cold room. We ate in the Brasserie where the relaxed atmosphere continues and the menu is varied and the portions are generous. 
2; Went to Nutfield Priory for an overnight spa break. The hotel was beautiful, service impeccable, and views amazing! However, we were disappointed that the spa facilities were in a separate building next door to the hotel which did not uphold the standards of the main hotel building. Not only were the spa facilities open to the public (membership only) they were also filled with children (it was a weekend I guess!). The spa area was probably on a par with the rest of the hotel but the surrounding pool, sports hall, fitness centre and cafe area were more like 2/3* level.  We had an amazing meal in the Cloisters restaurant whilst looking out across the beautiful Sussex downs, and the service in there was faultless! Likewise, breakfast in the Cloisters was very tasty - geared up for a full-English style breakfast as opposed to a continental/buffet. We got totally stung by our pre-dinner drinks - £15 for a beer and a G&T but it was worth it for the deal I got with the hotel and dinner was such good value! I would definitely recommend the hotel but don't think the hotel should be sold as a Spa hotel. 
2; Just returned from a weekend break. Abs lovely hotel. Staff very friendly and approachable. Food very nice. Rooms very nice and clean. Mini bar was well stocked. Resturant food was OK and reasonably priced.  Only downfall was the main lift being out of order. But these things happen. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to family and friends. 
2; Stayed for 1 night - arrived late due to attending a concert at the BIC - left early so wasn't able to take advantage of the hotel's facilities. Comfy beds - nice to have a teapot!! Decor a bit old-fashioned En-suite miniscule! 
2; I took my mother to the Headland for her birthday for a two night stay. It's in the most amazing position and looks very striking. The staff were warm and welcoming and their friendly professionalism is definitely part of the Headland experience. Whether we were at reception, the bar or in the restaurants, the service was top class and always with a smile. The hotel itself is beautiful. Our room was very spacious with fabulous views of the ocean. A few minor gripes were that we didn't have a fridge in our room and the shower was not very good. I think the bathroom could also have done with a hook as there was no where to hang anything. My mother found our room a little bleak, for example, there was only one curtain on the window which made it looked unfinished and the walls were very bare. But the beds were very comfortable, it was spotlessly clean and we loved the view. In addition to the lovely staff, the superb location, the sumptious interior of the hotel, the food was absolutely wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed every meal. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and full of flavour - I would say that the chef definitely has the x-factor! All in all it was a really enjoyable few days and not only will we definitely return, but I would recommend the Headland Hotel to anyone. I look forward to our next visit! 
2; I was booked by my Company to stay at the Strand Hotel for one night. What a fabulous location. So central. On the night we arrived we walked a few yards along the Strand to the Adelphi Theatre where we saw the most enjoyable Kinky Boots show. We also had a walk the other way over the Waterloo Bridge from where we had a great view of Big Ben and the London Eye all lit up. The next morning we walked to Trafalgar Square then down the Mall to Buckingham Palace. Back up to Westminster and Big Ben then back down the Strand and Fleet Street to St Pauls. Also fitted in Covent Garden. Hotel is in such a good location. Nice sized room with comfortable beds and good sized bathroom. Breakfast was tasty and served in a pleasant dining room. Lovely welcoming reception area where it was nice to sit an relax between jaunts out. Only negative was the noise from traffic. We were on the fourth floor at the front and the traffic noise was constant even with the shutters closed. Can't be helped being on such a busy street. 
2; We stayed through secret escapes, we had a superior room which was very good, open bathroom, king size bed and balcony which was a lovely touch. if i was to be very picky with the room, the mattress was a bit saggy but had a good mattress topper on, and the quilt was at the end of its life, all the filling in clumps in other places just material. and the bath plug did not fit very well and had to keep the water running. We eat in Acorns from a set menu, the service here was very slow, we had to wait 20 mins just to get our bottle of wine, and over 20 mins for each course, although the food was nice for a set menu,  overall a very pleasant stay and we would return. 
2; Stayed here for one night with Partner and 7 year old son, we had dinner and breakfast included in the deal. I chose the steak for dinner and was a bit disappointed as i asked for it medium and it came more than well done. The rest of the meal was really nice just a shame about the steak! Room was really nice although we were high up in the turrets and there are no lifts so was quite a mission to get to/find the room. Buffet breakfast was perfect. A really nice castle would definitely go back again 
2; I choose this Holiday Inn due to its close proximity to both the A1& A19. Staff helpful & friendly. Room - clean & comfortable with a choice of soft or firm pillows. Breakfast was excellent, with plenty of choice. We had evening meal here both nights, food was good with a good choice unfortunately the first night we waited about 45mins as there was only one chef on but the second night was much quicker. Would I stay here again - yes there is a swimming pool, gym & spa but I didn't use these facilities as was to busy day tripping. Wi if was free. 
2; Stayed1 night here and cannot praise the staff highly enough. Friendly attentive and helpful. Great breakfast and the loveliest cocktails. Our room was slightly on the small side but this did not affect our stay at all. We were even told where we could park for no charge just 1 minute away from the hotel. 
2; I recently stayed at this hotel for one night for a wedding. The whole day ran smoothly. The rooms were great! An iron and ironing board were provided which was great! The bar stayed open until 2am for us and the staff were very friendy   The food during he reception was fantastic! The only downside to the duration of the stay was the breakfast the next morning. Although there was a wide choice of cereals, the full breakfast was very small. However, this is minor as it was still enjoyable! 
2; It costs £94 according to the website and is set to increase to £99 later this month, we booked via Thomas Cook and paid £199 for 2 nights including dinner on the first night and breakfast both days. The food was fantastic both for the evening meal and for breakfast. The rooms were sizeable, but fairly standard and the bed wasn't the most comfortable I have slept in. I was also a bit surprised to find that the windows didn't open especially in the smoking rooms. The location is fantastic and Bristol is a great place to go for a night out. Taxi's in Bristol are expensive, so I'd recommend asking the hotel for a map and walking - it's actually quite easy to navigate. 
2; Fantastic central location, directly opposite Exeter Central Station and 5 mins walk from the shops and sights! Breakfast was included in the price of the room and offered much choice. The Hot Chocolate was delicious :) Most staff were polite, friendly and approachable. The only downside was that there wasn't many sockets in the room and the ones available were not were the bedside cabinets are, so not ideal for charging your mobile. Also the room was hot at night time and when the windows were open you could hear the sound of Seagulls very early in the morning (I would recommend wearing ear plugs). 
2;" I stayed here on business for 1 night in January 2013. The hotel is in a great location, right in the centre of the city but it is quite and has a comfortable and friendly atmosphere. I booked via Laterooms.co.uk and got a great discount compared to what you would pay on the day so it was very good value for money. I stayed in a double room - they are not huge, but have everything you need; including an impressive looking bathroom and very comfortable large bed. I didn't eat at the hotel that evening, but had breakfast in the morning. The breakfast facilities were surprisingly minimal, but not so that I would comment badly on the hotel - if you are looking for a great deal of option for breakfast however you may want to look else where. There is a very small buffet serving sausages, egg, bacon and tomato’s and some croissants or toast available. Other than that I happened to spend most of the day working from the hotel the following day - and they were very flexible allowing me a 1.30pm late check out at no additional cost. Parking was fine and cost £8 for 24 hours. I then worked in the restaurant and had a lovely salad and was well looked after with free internet for about 4 hours. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to others. "
2; The hotel was in the perfect location for our visit to Buckingham Palace. Our room was spacious and very comfortable and very clean Nice friendly staff who made our stay very enjoyable. Would stay there again. 
2; Stayed for one night with 7 days parking and paid £70 so quite a good deal. Hotel itself is lovely, really impressive and clean. We parked in the underground car park so in our opinion this was a bonus ie not left out in the snow! Although note no lift to hotel reception so bit of a pain having to carry suitcases up the stairs (who wants to put their back out before they go away?!) We always enjoy a few drinks and some food before we go away (who doesn't!) however the pub was a huge disappointment. We actually walked out at first (live football on a large screen that no-one was watching, would have been nice to have some music, also a bit cold) and decided to try and find the local pizza express (it seemed safe enough to walk however as someone else had mentioned, no-one else was out walking which does make you wonder sometimes) Anyway, found pizza express and it was total chaos in there so walked out and tried the pub next door only to be told they were not serving food (on a Sat night) So we had to bite the bullet and go back to the pub in the hotel. Choice of food could be better and below average quality (how difficult is it to do a decent wrap with chips and sausage and mash?) Two drinks each, total spent £40 so we decided to have an early night, probably not a bad thing but not the start to the holiday you want. All in all if you are not bothered about eating in the hotel (Italian restaurant not really our cup of tea) then stay here. Shuttle bus did not run the next morning as only 4 of us going so we had a people carrier to take us to airport and this was fine. Coming back, we rang (after we collected our cases as instructed) and ended up waiting 45 mins for another taxi (apparently late as stuck in traffic, apparently, although not rush hour) so this wasn't the best as freezing cold waiting outside. Taxi driver not at all bothered about being late. For us, we would probably try another hotel next time. 
2; This hotel even though further out than hotels we normally use, was sufficient for our needs and met them fully after a few hiccups pertinent to our specific booking, we enjoyed our two night stay. The accessible room 102 was excellent for our needs with a good turning circle for a powered wheelchair but we found the shower seat too small 
2; Although I only made a tentative telephone enquiry, Katie was so friendly and helpful I just had to write and let you know. My recent experience with other venues has not come close to Katie's sincerity and enthusiasm - thanks Katie - you have truly found your vocation. 
2;Little touches make it better than other Heathrow hotels: the takeaway coffee cups in the room (if you want to take your tea out) for example. What could be better: be aware that breakfast included is continental. It's really good, but if you're a bacon and eggs fan you'll need to get your wallet out. Check-in is also questionable, with it's terrible ergonomics, horrible little booths, and impersonal staff. But the staff in the bars and restaurants were really welcoming.
2; We stayed in July for 2 nights. Friendly service, nice spacious room and very clean. Could have one with a few more tea bags though! The only downside it was right on the main road, High Holborn and it was quite noisy. The central location however, made up for any downsides. Easy walking distance to covent garden, soho, trafalgar square.  Will stay again, brilliant value for money. 
2; Absolutely great place to stay! Definitely be staying again. Would've been a 5 however there were a few damages in the bathroom. But apart from that it's a really great place to stay. Loved that there were films in the room free of charge! Great atmosphere in the bar too. 
2;We used this hotel as a stay over before an early morning flight to Lapland. We chose it because of 'Ask Alfred' which is a childs package. Charles was well looked after and made to feel special. Our room was spacious and clean. Only 1 restaurant or bar food so not too much choice with a small one. All staff very helpful and courteous.
2;" Had a great 3 days at the Royal Bath Hotel, Bournemouth. Would advise upgrading to a sea view room which was well worth the extra i.e. large room & balcony and super views. It takes a while to find your way around this hotel which is part of its charm. Exiting via the back door through the lounge/bar area takes you through the gardens and directly onto the cliff path. The one downside was the catering. The staff were charming and the food was good but you got the feeling it lacked management. For example, soup served without any bread; main course fish served with no accompanying vegetables and there was not an option to order these on the menu. Lunch time snacks in the bar consisted of pre-prepared sandwiches, i.e. the ham & mustard could not be served without the mustard. There was only one person in charge of restocking the breakfast buffet and a request to other staff to refill the marmalade met with no result. Having said all this, we had an enjoyable stay. A few tips: book the valet parking ahead as this was full up when we arrived; take your room towel to the leisure centre to avoid a £1 charge. "
2; The room was very clean and comfortable. Modern & well equipped. The only thing that let this hotel down was the exceptionally long wait to be served dinner, 3 staff for a packed restaurant, no apology for delays, had to ask more than once where our food was.  Other than this, I have no complaints about this hotel. 15 min taxi to North Terminal from here. Yes I would stay again despite restaurant delays. 
2; WE booked this hotel to stay for 2 nights as wanted to visit Drayton Manor. It locatin was ideal for this trip and the family room we had was ideal. Teh kids enjoyed using the pool and the food was very family friendly. 
2; Me, my sister and our friend stayed here for 2 nights in February. The hotel is gorgeous- our room was lovely, definitely not lacking in character. The staff were all nice and the location was idea of us - lots of nice places nearby to eat. My only complaint was the heat in the room, I felt as if I was in Greece or something and that was with air conditioning, and it was not hot outside, so it made sleeping/hanging out in the hotel a bit uncomfortable. Apart from that though, it was a really nice stay. 
2; If you're a bit fed up with the crowds, noise, and need just to chill out and relax, jump on the train to Thorpe. A bed and breakfast option for a day or two, I think is money well spent. I had a back massage which was very good. Used the pool almost by myself even though the place was pretty full. Tasty food, very friendly staff, but most importantly nice atmosphere, and lovely setting. I came back energized and definitely going back. The only thing was too soft mattress. 
2; Luxurious rooms, enjoyable a meals and picturesque surroundings. Relaxing spa but book in advance to avoid disappointment as you are unlikely to be able to book treatments in the day. I would recommend meals from the al a carts menu rather than buffet, they were a different class but you have the option of either. Lovely helpful staff. The following needs improvement -  Bathrooms were a little dated but had everything we needed and swimming pool changing rooms and showers were a bit grotty. Pulse nightclub downstairs also needs renovation. But we still managed to have a good night. 
2; We stayed here for just one night and couldn't fault it. Great location in the centre of Sheffield and 24hr car parks close by. It's about a 10 min drive to Meadowhall. The staff were very friendly and the room was spotless and very spacious. Didn't try any food so can't comment. Overall we would definitely recommend and hopefully we stay here again in the future. 
2; Spent three nights in this quirky hotel in Brighton. It is very well positioned in the town and an  easy walk from the beachfront and most of the sights to visit. Good restaurants are within easy reach. We did not try the Chillie Pickle restaurand at the hotel but it looked fun and were told that it is really good. We enjoyed our funky room it was very different - but in a fun way. Enjoyed the lively bar too! 
2;Went for a two day spa break with my sister and had a super time. Our room ws large and well appointed with a nice view over the gardens. The two restaurants were good, very different one posh and the other more of a pub, food in both was excellent although the service in the pub was a bit slow. The spa treatments were lovely, you must try the muscle ease wrap! The staff were all friendly and helpful. Only slight downside was how busy it was, the relaxation room was overtaken by a large party, not the fault of the hotel but ,made it hard for other spa guests to relax (maybe a separate area for large groups would be an idea?) Overall good value for money and I look forward to going back.
2;" We (my Husband and I) booked a great package through Travel Zoo to stay at The Savill Court Hotel on 1st & 2nd October to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Deal was £99.00 per night for room, breakfast, 3 course dinner on 2nd night, wine, chocolates and fruit in room on arrival and vouchers for Spa and Food/Drink.  First thing I did before arriving was upgrade our room to a feature room as I had read previous reviews of how the standard double rooms were very small, so I paid an extra £29.00 per night to upgrade.  Hotel is in lovely grounds, with a great location right next door to Windsor Great Park (more of that later), plenty of parking and lovely looking hotel on arrival. Check in was a breeze and staff very friendly and helpful, plus throughout the weekend we found them to be very nice, polite, curteous staff and always smiling.  We had room 164 (see photos) in the Garden wing on the first floor, it was a nice size with a lovely view of the gardens/grounds (pity about the rain). More of an Executive room than a feature room, but then again I have not seen the executive rooms at this hotel so maybe I am wrong. Expected it to be more quaint or special, being a feature room and one down from the best rooms available. Was nice enough though and very clean and comfortable with mullioned windows (reckon that is the feature).  On arrival we had the stated bottle of wine which was red and a very nice Merlot, not a cheap house wine that I expected would be there. Fruit was one small orange, one small apple and one banana in a bowl wrapped with cellophane and a bow and the chocolates were four small (very nice) chocolates in a box.  Bath robes in the wardrobe were a nice touch and very soft also, as were the towels in the bathroom - bring a flannel or wash cloth as hotel does not provide these. Toiletries consisted of shower gel, shampoo, shower cap and soap.  Room was nice and our only fault would be that the lighting in the room and bathroom is very poor, cannot do your make-up in the room in the evening/night as poor lighting.  Breakfast on both days was lovely, fresh, tasty and well replenished, never ran out of anything while we were there, staff very friendly and helpful.   Dinner on 2nd night (free with package) was a bit of a farce, waited in doorway to restaurant, of which entry is through the bar, several members of staff saw us waiting to be seen, but totally ignored us. Finally I asked a passing suited person who I thought was the Maitre'D and he said to wait and he would send over someone. Eventually the real Maitre'D came over and showed us to our seat in the centre of the room (restaurant a large room at the side of the hotel with circular windows overlooking the grounds, but very impersonal and not cosy for a couple as very open). We waited at our table for a long time before someone came and took our drinks order, then another long wait before our food order was taken. Our reservation was at 7.30pm, we placed our food order at 8pm and we waited 1.5hrs before we were served our starter. In the meantime after another wait, someone brought over a &quot;slice&quot; of bread each and we expected to get the balsmic vinegar and oil to dip our bread in as stated on the menu, but that never materialised. We were getting annoyed as people who came in after us were already served their starters, so we asked where ours were and were reassured that they would be along soon. Eventually the starters arrived, my husband had the Pate and that was very nice with crackers, I had Goats cheese, a bit bland and no crackers or bread to eat with it. We waited another 45 minutes for our main, while watching the chaos ensue around us as other people complained about the wait and several left, saying that they were checking out of the hotel because of the service in the restaurant! Our mains arrived, steak for my husband who said it was really good and well cooked, medium rare as asked and I had the lamb & mint burger which was equally nice, both came with chunky chips which were more of a let-down as they were almost burnt on the outside and not the best potato inside. We were almost scared to order dessert because of the long waiting times, but we had a laugh with the waiter when ordering this as he assured us this would not take long as it did not need to be cooked i.e. just served. When asked why food had taken so long, we were told it was because there was a wedding on as well - not a good excuse as there is a wedding every day on the weekend as far as we could see, one on Friday night as well.  The weddings being held in the hotel are a plus though as they bring a lively atmosphere to the bar and the bar is a lovely room with an open fireplace and comfortable sofas and chairs and good service.  Had a quick look at the pool and spa downstairs in the basement, but did not use so cannot comment on this, look very good though.  Our first night we ate at The Harvester (The Bell) a short drive from the hotel, food as you would expect a Harvester to be, my burger and chips were lovely, my husbands steak was awful. Drinks good and cheap though, unlike the hotel which was quite expensive (as hotels are) for drinks. There is also a pub (Fox & Hounds) within walking distance from the exit of the hotel (exit different place to entrance to hotel) just before the entrance to The Great Park and I looked at their menu which seemed very nice.  Best feature to the hotel is it's location to The Great Park and if you are up to it, just under an hour's walk through The Great park into Windsor, or you could take the horse drawn cab from right at the entrance to the hotel (where the horses are stabled) to Windsor Castle. Spoke to the drive of the horse drawn cab, the only registered horse drawn taxi cab in Windsor and a hundred years old, passed down in the family to the current driver who looked about 80 but was very nice and helpful with directions etc. Also offered to give us a lift back to the hotel at 5pm if we wanted on his return back home. We walked to Windsor through The Great Park and through the Deer park with hundreds of deer, a great sight (see photos). It is a lovely walk and does not seem that long when you are walking because of the view and the pebble dashed drive/walk to Windsor Castle (The Great Walk). Had a lovely day in Windsor on the Saturday, boat trip down the Thames, great Ploughmans in the Wetherspoons pub on the High Street opposite Castle.  Overall a lovely weekend, nice hotel, good room, great breakfasts, the only let down was the poor lighting in the room and the service at dinner. "
2; Found this hotel on booking.com for overnight stay for Proms in the Park in Hyde Park, and it could n't have worked out better. Ideally situated for Hyde Park and Oxford Circus. The hotel room was clean, although it would have been a challenge if the lift was out of order, as we were on the 7th floor. We decided to go down to the restaurant by the stairs in the morning, and the staircase winds round and round so I was a bit dizzy by the time we got there, but the breakfast was good and plentiful. Room was very good value for such a well situated hotel with continental breakfast included in the price. I will certainly use it again in the future especially as it is very close to the tube stations. 
2; We booked this hotel via Cruise Direct as recommended by them. After booking we read all the adverse reviews on Tripadvisor. We approached our stay with some trepidation but thought as it was only for one nigh, and a bargain rate, we'd just put up with it. I think we must have been in a totally different hotel than the previous reviewers! The staff were courteous and helpful. Initially we were allocated a room with a very small window which we were unable to open. As the room was warm we asked to move to somewhere more airy. This wasn't a problem, the change was made immediately. The new room was large, comfortable and clean. The restaurant meal was very tasty if slightly over priced. Following a 4 30 wake-up call we used the shuttle bus service to the airport. On our return to Gatwick we used the shuttle bus back to the hotel to pick up our car. The whole process worked like clockwork. If we fly from Gatwick again we will definitely stay in the Cambridge hotel prior to our flight 
2; Visited for the first time in June for a friends birthday, easy to find and plenty of parking. Check in/out was swift and pleasant, our room was spacious, very clean and quiet. Several other guests from our group arrived early on the Friday to take advantage of a deal that was on Groupon or Living Social for treatments and all said they were excellent. Gathered in the bar which had a nice ambiance and wasn't overly priced. The entertainment was 60's night, many people got into the spirit and dressed for the occasion which enhanced the party atmosphere. We were served with a 3 course meal and despite the numbers it was hot and tasty with music playing throughout then it got lively (louder not raucous) as the disco went on into the early hours. We all took advantage of the swimming pool the following day and relaxed in the sun room area to the side. All in all a really enjoyable stay which prompted me to jump at the chance of staying in the same chain in Leeds in October of this year. 
2; My husband and I stayed here for three nights as a surprise birthday treat for me. Overall we had a very enjoyable experience. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the hotel itself is in a nice area close to Paddington station. Our room was small but perfectly adequate and spotlessly clean. We ate in the hotel restaurant on two evenings and especially enjoyed the Indian food which apparently is cooked by their very own Indian chef! Would definitely recommend this hotel for its friendly staff, great location and great food!! 
2; We booked a one night stay at Wyck Hill House mainly to use the Spa. The facilities were very nice, we spent the day in the relaxation area along with having a couple of treatments. When we nipped up into the main hotel for lunch the service was fast and friendly despite the hotel being busy with a wedding.   The dinner was also nice although the vegetarian choice was limited. The hand made sweets that came with the coffee at the end of the meal were an especially nice touch. The food isn't cheap but it is very nice.  The room was very light, airy and spacious with a wonderful view of the countryside.  Altogether a lovely, relaxing stay. Staff in all areas of the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We are already planning our next visit. 
2; I have stayed here on business a couple of times now and I like the hotel, the staff are friendly, the rooms are generously sized and the pool is really lovely. I've had room service which was fine and I enjoyed breakfast very much. The bedroom furniture is a little tired but the beds are comfy, thew only real criticism is the layout of the hotel....you have to go down stairs walk across and then back up to get to the majority of rooms which would be a pain if you had loads of luggage or mobility problmes but overall I like Dunston Hall and will stay there again. 
2; We arrived hen party to be told only 2 rooms had been booked although we had paid for 3 rooms Staff where nice  Rooms are nice and big, spacious and great if your staying a few nights  Beds uncomfortable and I have bad back ache now Clean   
2; Enjoyed our nights stay to attend WI AGM at conference centre. Good self service breakfast. Bathrooms very modern and beds comfortable. Nice to have a small fridge and safety deposit box in the room without extra charge. Underground parking excellent and you get discount when staying at hotel. Would recommend 
2; my husband and I have been to this hotel a few times now and will continue to return. The hotel is a very modern looking hotel with great staff and good rooms. The restaurant and bar are really nice and serve great food and also the most amazing cocktails. There is hotel car park but this is on a first come first served basis however if you can not get a space there you can use the NCP across the road at a discounted price. There is a lovely swimming pool too. We have stayed in both the standard room and the executive rooms and to be honest with you there's really not that much difference other than a large floor space, free WIFI, use of the coffee machine and bathrobes...Oh you can have the contents of the minibar but don't get to excited as it only contains water :0). There really is not too much difference other then the price. We would recommend taking up the breakfast offer as they food is lovely and the staff are really nice to, they take the time to talk about your evening before and seem to remember your face which is really nice also. 
2;The breakfasts and dinners were both very good, and conference facilities excellent. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms weer fine but for a hotel of this standard I would have expected bottled water in the rooms and perhaps minibars in the superior rooms.
2; Stayed in this hotel for just one night whilst in London for a concert and was very impressed by the value for money and level of service.  Location wise it was fine... a little bit of a walk to Pimlico or Westminster stations (10mins), but a nice one.   The room was lovely - simple but clean, with everything you could need and lovely and quiet. Part of the iron was missing, but we managed to get it working and the staff were so lovely, I'm sure there would have been no problems getting another.  We ate dinner and breakfast in the hotel, and both were excellent, although the side dishes ordered with dinner seemed to be very salty (the tuna made up for it though!).  I have to stress how wonderful the staff were. They advised on getting around, ordered taxis and generally bent over backward to help. You would expect this kind of service from a good 4 star hotel, but I have been to several where it was not the case.  Overall for the price paid this is the best value hotel I have stayed in and would definately return next time I go to London. 
2;" Spacious clean room, with great views. Staff couldn't have been nicer. Welcoming, friendly, efficient and helpful. On occasions though they were unavailable and there was an element of &quot;do it yourself.&quot; We had a small balcony, too windy to use when we were there but it looked like it could have done with a little TLC - a tidy up and clean. Close to amenities. Several discounts available on local facilities. Continental breakfast was delicious. Bar prices seemed a little high. Overall, however, we really enjoyed our stay and would return. "
2; Hotel is in an excellent central location. Rooms were spacious, comfortable and very clean. One of ur party uses a wheelchair and staff went out of their way to assist us. Particular thanks to Stewart Wilson in the concierge team for this. No queues for breakfast, but on that day (a Sunday) staff were slow to clear our cereal dishes so when our hot food came the table was overflowing! That's a very small niggle though in what was otherwise an excellent visit. Will definitely stay again. 
2; My twin sister and l had our joint birthday at Marston Farm Hotel. The marquee was beautifully set out for us, and we were allowed in to put up photo's and balloons well before our guests arrived. The staff were helpful and efficient. At no time were we rushed to leave, it was all that we had hoped for, an informal and happy event. Organiser Jan was very helpful and pleasant with a good sense of humour. Thank you to all the staff. Mary 
2; Very picturesque hotel, staff were friendly and helpful, great location with parking - we visited Blenheim Palace whilst there. A few things let it down: breakfast on the Sunday morning didn't seem to have particularly fresh ingredients (it was much tastier on Saturday morning, and the bread wasn't as hard!), the bar prices were very high for 'ordinary' drinks (spirits etc) and we had incredibly loud neighbours. Not sure if we were just unlucky with the last one, but we could hear every word - and I mean EVERY - when the people downstairs were having a conversation! 
2; Booked this stay on booking.com with the thought that it was on Bond street in central London.. turns out it's in Ealing. Wasn't very well communicated on booking.com but we went non the less. Lovely staff and lay out. good decor although there was no fridge/ice bucket for drinks and everything is wood effect and so appears quite cheap rather than quality which I paid for. There is a lack of parking - we had to park in a NCP car park until we could park outside on the road for which there is a big lack of. All in all a nice relaxing trip and you really wouldn't expect it to be there! 
2; A nice clean hotel, with everything you need in a small room. Friendly staff.  The bedroom was small but clean. It was quiet, comfortable, and all you needed for a short business stay. It didn't feel luxurious or special and wouldn't be my choice for a romantic get-away or weekend treat. No room service but a small corner in reception selling small bottles of wine, cans of g&t, snacks, pot noodle-y type food, sandwiches and similar with a microwave available for your use. Again, not luxurious, but it filled its purpose.   Breakfast was lovely, a wide selection, including a waffle iron available with maple syrup and fruit compote and a egg/omelette-chef on stand by. The staff had serious problem keeping up on our second morning, as there was a small rush of people heading to a early conference - leaving the breakfast buffet looking pretty sad with lots of options missing, an omelette pan burning, and a mess of spilled beans and scrambled eggs, sticky HP sauce bottles and general chaos. The staff was topping up some options but didn't think of tidying up as they were going. They also came across as very rushed and stressed. This could have been us catching them on a bad day, but it was a real shame as the staff staying in control, being aware, and managing just a few small things better would have given us a much better experience and last impression of the hotel. 
2; Stayed here one night prior to a conference and would definitely like to stay again. The Hilton at Deansgate lives up to its reputation in most aspects. The actual hotel itself is impressive and our room was too, even if it wasn't enormous. The room was clean and comfortable and mostly quiet apart from a few hours in the evening when there was a gig happening close by (this ended around 11pm though). The breakfast is great, essentially as much as you want to eat of a wide range of different foods with friendly staff too. Great if you want to fill up for the day.  There are only two reasons why I didn't give this hotel 5 stars. One is the fact that the Wifi was useless and I never managed to get it to work, despite being a Hilton Honours member. This is pretty shoddy for a modern hotel in 2016.  The second reason is that, while having the pool/jacuzzi area to go to was very nice, it was difficult to relax once there as there is a grand total of 4 chairs available for guests to use. So we ended up sat on the floor. Could be much better!  But overall the hotel is great and I look forward to (hopefully) staying there again on my next visit to Manchester. 
2; My boyfriend and I recently stayed here for 2 nights (9th – 11th March) for his birthday. We had a privileged room, which was a good size and very clean. We had a large bed, opening windows, plenty of tea/coffee, complimentary water and even chocolate. There was also a Nespresso coffee machine, but unfortunately we didn't find the coffee pods until the morning we were checking out!   The hotel is in a great location for Vinopolis, The Globe, The Tate and Borough Market, all of which were just a few minutes walk away. One evening we walked to the London Palladium at a leisurely pace (stopping along the way) and that only took 45 mins.   We had breakfast both mornings (served until 11.30am at weekends!) as it was included in our rate and it was lovely. Plenty of choice from the buffet, plus a few extras you could order from the menu. I can't really comment on the price of the room as we paid with Tesco vouchers (we only paid £5!) but the on the door price is extortionate (£390 for a privilege room!). I'd suggest shopping around for the best available deal.  The only down side to this hotel was the building works going on in the morning. We opened our windows Friday night to get some fresh air and were woken up at 8am Saturday morning by very loud drilling. Although not the fault of the hotel, a warning of the work would of been nice as no one expects to be woken up at the weekend by builders! 
2; my daughter and i stayed on a saturday night and had a deluxe double which overlooked the sea and pier.... brilliant location and great views. the staff were very friendly and helpful... a nice hotel which a central lobby, the room was a good size with all the usual facilities, good sized soft towels - a bug bear of mine so was pleased with them and nice toiletries. breakfast was good with a nice range, as it was christmas the hotel had parties in the evening and one was in the central lobby but it did not detract from our enjoyment and we were able to 'have a go on their roulette table which was fun'. some of the rooms overlooked the central area and if you had children noise could be a factor but we were away from it so not a problem to us.. all in all a fab stay and would return 
2; Hard to find a more central hotel, but the Strand Palace, whilst convenient, is a bit on the pricey side for what you are getting ... single rooms are very small and the decor is a little old-fashioned. Lifts are tortuous ... 
2; On arrival we were greeted by a photographer who politely asked if we'd like photos, what a lovely touch and the they were so nice we bought all 3. Then onto our glass of bubbly whilst our waitress took us to our table, the room was beautifully decorated and had a very nice atmosphere. We had buffet style but was very well organised and displayed, my starter was the from the fish platter which was outstanding!! Main course was plentiful and delicious, would have preferred it a little warmer but that was my only slight gripe. Choice of deserts which were again mouthwatering. All the staff were absolutely delightful and really made our day, the children got a personalised visit from Santa and very nice gifts. Great day…..Thank you to all staff, would highly recommend. 
2; Enjoyed our stay very much. Comfortable hotel, really friendly staff, great location. Given an early check in on arrival and pleased with room which was a good size, modern, comfy bed and clean. Missed a bath but that is a small issue of preference. Breakfast was good - lots of choice including a make your own waffle machine - very tasty. Bar prices - apart from wine - very reasonable for a hotel bar. Also offered a late check out which was really helpful as we had an evening flight. 
2; Really enjoyed our stay here. This place is achingly stylish and has so many modern features it doesn't compare to most hotels. Beautiful lobby and lounge areas. Staff friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the central courtyard. Very quiet and clean with fantastic big bed and rain shower. The room is controlled by a Samsung tablet, everything from mood light, tv, internet and blinds. No iron but there is a communal ironing room on each floor. Toy rabbit thing in the room was a nice touch but seemed a little out of place as this is not really a family friendly hotel.  I would give a 5 star rating if it weren't for the lack of tea/coffee facilities in room. I consider it essential to have a cuppa when I arrive and especially first thing in the morning. Here you have to get dressed and go down to the restaurant for a hot drink, shame really. Apart from that, I would definitely recommend to anyone needing 1 or 2 nights in London. For anything longer, a more traditional hotel might be advised. 
2; Was here for a business event. Parking is ample. Hotel looked very nice. Staff were very friendly. Easy access to the M6   They serve tea and coffee and the meeting room facilities were very nice.   Next door is a garden centre and the Inn is only 10 mins away from the M6.    
2; Just returned from 2 nights at this delightful hotel where we celebrated our Ruby Wedding Anniversary, along with our daughter and son and their respective husband and wife.  We were made extremely welcome and really appreciated the celebratory half bottle of champagne which we found in our room awaiting our arrival.  The staff were friendly and efficient, our room was spacious and well furnished and the bed was huge and fantastically comfortable. Only slight gripe was that, as it was a garden room and therefore easily accessible from the outside, the French door cannot safely be left open all night making it a bit stuffy. A fan should have been provided as part of the room fixtures. Luckily the nights were reasonably cool and we slept well anyway, minus most of the bedclothes.  The bath and shower were also a bit tricky. The shower temperature could only be regulated from scalding hot to painfully hot and the central push button bath plug refused to lock down properly so the water seeped away slowly, leaving me sitting in a puddle attempting to rinse my hair using the shower fitting, whilst trying to avoid cooking my head!  Dinner was good, apart from a portion of samphire which had a strange chemical flavour, but service was perhaps a little too fast and efficient - portions were generous and we had to ask for extra time before deciding whether to embark on puddings.  Breakfast spectacularly good.   All in all a very happy and enjoyable stay at a friendly, beautifully appointed hotel in our favourite part of Norfolk. I have no hesitation in recommending the Blakeney and look forward to a return stay, although I hope the plumbing will work better next time! 
2; Amazing location with lovely decor and buzzing atmosphere. Rooms very stylish, although be warned that the beach suites only have a partial sea view, so not as spectacular as some of the rooms in the main house. The main bar and restaurant are lovely and breakfast was great. Lunch and dinner were good, but the food was perhaps not quite up to the London prices they are charging. Service was mixed - some really out their heart into it and were very good. Others seemed too cool for school, visibly annoyed when asked to do something and standing around joking with their friends. Waiting 3 hours for the room to be ready wasn't ideal with 2 young children... yes, we were early but 'prioritising' our room to be made up ended up being ready 5 minutes before normal time and then they'd forgotten the cot. No one seemed to be in charge to deal with clients. Little things perhaps, but at these prices this place should have the staff to get things done, be attentive and at least outwardly look like they enjoy their jobs! 
2; We had an executive room...very nice...only odd thing was the toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom..no problem with that but then you have to pop round to the bathroom to wash your hands.. just thought it was a strange set up! Our room overlooked the DLR station, however we had no idea of this till the 2nd day when we decided to look out of the window...there had been no noise from this at all and we had been totally unaware!! We spent our time sightseeing and were amazed at the amount of lovely things to do and see for free or a small fee...spent the weekend there and didn't see everything ...will definitely book Novotel again for our next visit! 
2;"My partner and I had a short but enjoyable stay this week. All the staff were very helpful and courteous.Food was excellent and breakfast was so vast you couldn't wish for better. Our room was on the front of the hotel which is quite noisy (not the hotels fault) and my only other criticism is the bathroom; shower is above bath and it is quite high to step over and the retro hairdryer could do with replacing for a more modern version. All in all its in a good location, staff are excellent especially the lady who takes charge of breakfast and the guys in Longfords bar. Well worth the money."
2; Overall the hotel and grounds were very nice, scenic and well kept. Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Restaurant was good, but had very little variety between the lunch and dinner menus, so if you're eating here, I'd advise having dinner at the restaurant and maybe a lunch at the bar or wait till 14.30 and have afternoon tea, rather than both lunch and dinner in the restaurant.  The spa was nice, however facilities at the spa, like the swimming pool are basic. We really enjoyed access to the classes run at the facility.  Staff were really friendly, and most of the time would bend over backwards to help make our stay as special as possible. 
2; We had a fabulous room, wonderful afternoon in the spa and pool (jacuzzi chilli as it's the same temperature as the pool) but lovely staff in there and very clean.   The only thing that we can and will say is how disappointed we were with the chef! 4.50 we ordered afternoon tea which we were really looking forward to. At 5.05 a member of staff told us that we couldn't have our cream tea as it was too late and stopped at 5pm. We explained we ordered at 4.50 maybe even earlier so we was confused. The restaurant manage who was very embarrassed proceeded to tell us that the chef was refusing to make our cream tea even though he had received it well before 5pm....... I have stayed at this hotel numerous times over the last 10 years and I've never heard anything like it before. It has definitely clouded my judgement on eating there again. Such a shame 
2; Here’s a question for you. To produce a decent cup of English tea do you have to ‘cook’ it? I mean you must boil and add water, stick it in a pot with leaves or tea bag, waiting for it to gestate properly before pouring it, adding milk, and it is ready for consumption. No matter how you answer this question it is at last a debateable proposition. If this is the case, then surely making a bowl of porridge is in a similar category.   But not presently at the Hotel Du Vin in Cambridge.  In a global first where my room rate included breakfast, I was told that I was only allowed ‘one cooked dish’ when I staggered in for my first meal of the day. It was EITHER porridge OR my bacon and egg. I was so stunned that in what, in all other respects, is a quintessential ‘English’ hotel at its best, that I couldn’t get my brain in gear to question the sheer absurdity of this turn of events. As a man with a Sunny Disposition, I am ashamed to say it niggled me for the rest of the day and hence this cathartic post on a site that I rarely proclaim on unless something is out of the ordinary.   And yes this is out of the ordinary, nay extraordinary, for in no other hotel in the world where I have stayed, especially one purporting to be the best of British, does an Englishman have to pay a porridge premium when English breakfast is included in the tariff. An abomination, particularly on cold day when the wind is whipping around the Cathedrals of Learning that surround this lovely little place.  Put this right immediately M. Du Vin. Porridge is not ‘cooked’ it is ‘prepared’ just like the nice tea you serve so elegantly. Stick an extra couple of quid on the ‘with breakfast’ rack rate if you are penny pinching and concerned that Brexit may force up the costs of Oats! (Although surely Cambridge is surrounded by wheat farms?).   Your present set up is a chronic faux paus and completely unnecessary.  PS And before you ask, the reason I ‘staggered’ to breakfast was because I had a dream night’s sleep at this establishment. The bed was simply divine… 
2; My husband and I had our wedding here in September and we and our guests had a great time. The hotel is beautiful, but not too formal and suited out mixed age groups perfectly. The terrace at the back of the house overlooks wonderful parkland. The meal was simple (our choice), but well cooked, presented and served. The hotel is quite expensive - but this is Wimbledon, not out in the country and London prices apply. Recommended. 
2;A very lovely place! The staff were very accommodating, and the breakfast was great. They were very helpful when it came to allergies such as serving extra gluten free bread at breakfast and making everything else dairy free for us. The room was fine, and we slept really well. Great beds!  Overall a great experience!
2; Came all the way down for a wedding on the Sunday and I have to say what lovely place it is. When we arrived we was welcomed by the receptionist who showed us to where to go, and was very helpful. It also stated that we couldn't check in till 2pm but our rooms was ready so she let us check in. We had 3 rooms which was all lovely clean and had plenty of space. The bar/ catering staff at the wedding reception was very polite and didn't keep you long waiting for a drink. There was a fire alarm that went off in the morning but what I thought was the manager was coming round asking if someone was smokeing in our rooms so that was not the manors fault. The only bad point about our stay was the music beside the pond which is ment to go off at 11pm so we had a very long drive back to Aberdeen with hardly any sleep. We did get £20 off each of our rooms as a sorry.if I was ever down that way again as long as the music stopped at 11pm I would definitely book here again and have a spa day. 
2; We booked a two night stay at the Hallmark over a weekend and was very impressed by the service provided by both the restaurant and reception staff. The deal included a 3 course meal in the restaurant on the first night but we given the opportunity to choose which night we would like the meal. The menu was varied and when the food arrived absolutely delicious.   The only problem which arose was the bedroom - the bed was rather tiny for a double room booking and we suddenly discovered that the bathroom area had no door. We were not over comfortable with this arrangement and discussed the problem with the reception staff who could not do enough to apologise and arranged a new room for us.  The location of the hotel is excellent for walking into town and to the sea. The hotel is a little tired in places and on a busy road which can be noisy due to no double glazing but then you can't always have location to town without a little noise. 
2;" We stayed here for one night B&B during a touring holiday. Beautifully located inn with stunning views of the beach. We paid a little extra for a top floor room with beach views - well worth it. The room was large and had an extra dressing room as well as an en-suite bathroom. The bedroom had been recently renovated and was very comfortable; the bathroom was a bit dated and shabby but functional. Ate in the restaurant - make a reservation as it gets very busy. The fish and chips were freshly made and delicious. A friendly welcome and good service. Breakfast was good too, with more choice than the average B&B, including croissants and porridge. The bar is a bit shabby and pubby but the restaurant is light and bright with views over the beach. Parking can be a challenge but the staff help to move vehicles. "
2; The room was perfect would have stayed longer, excellent location , excellent facilities and view to die for kept curtains open all night view of shard, St pauls, and wonderful sun rise over city. Excellent location for all main hi lights of London . 
2; Excellent breakfast better than the village hotel. Service good, staff very helpful. Room very hot and uncomfortable at night, we was given a disabled room because there was three of us staying, couldn't have a shower unless I was bent down or on my knees no bath, so after a hot night could shower. 
2;"Stayed here in Dec 2011 for a work Christmas party. Room was fine and as expected except that it was very cold. Phoned Reception who said that they would &quot;see to it&quot; but nothing was done. Too busy I suspect. The function - Vegas Night - was average. Food predictable and typical of the old style of function fare. The entertainment was terrible. The singer was a disgrace. The casino tables were fun but there wasn't enough of them, particularly as most people were trying to get away from the singer. The breakfast was freshly cooked to order and enjoyable. Would try the hotel again for a leisue break but not for a function."
2; Stayed at the Hussey Manor Hotel for one night, wish it could have been more. The room & bathroom was extremity well decorated and good sized. Lovely comfortable bed and pretty views. Stayed for evening meal, which was very good. Perfect for a quiet short break (couples etc). 
2;" Decided to stay here for New Year's Eve and we're so glad we did. The room was beautiful - with a super king size bed, desk, reading chair and a lovely bathroom too. All was so tastefully decorated and topped off with a wonderful wooden headboard. We stayed in a room with a balcony and harbour views - and this truly made our new year.  The whole hotel has a boutique feel and everyone was so kind and helpful. The bar was pricey but as we're used to London prices we weren't too bothered by this. We had a lovely dinner that night that we'd booked in advance - I think perhaps what let it down was the price tag of £81 each. But with 4 courses, and the quality of the food being so high - we wouldn't complain.   At midnight we watched the fireworks and boats on our balcony with a bottle of prosecco - perfect.   The only reasons we didn't give it 5 stars was that the lift needed some updating and there were cigarette butts on our balcony that we only noticed in the light the next day. We could also hear a lot of noise and walking from the penthouse above but again these are little things that definitely wouldn't put us off visiting again.  Thank you Salthouse and if you're thinking of booking up - don't hesitate; it's worth the money for the views and the staff alone. "
2; We stayed here for one night before a flight out from Manchester Airport (mainly to avoid the awful chain airport hotels!).Stayed in a standard room which was lovely, very comfy bed, clean, well-equipped bathroom with fab rain shower. The bar area was nice to chill out in.  The only reason this doesn't get a 5* review from me is that the staff weren't particularly friendly. They were having some refurbs done when we stayed, so it was hard to get hold of a member of staff when you needed one. Also, we'd paid in advance, and weren't planning on using the restaurant/bar/room service, but they still insisted on taking a credit card deposit on arrival to cover anything we spent. This wasn't made clear at time of booking, and it took 3 weeks to be refunded to our account!  Useful info:  - it cost us £10 to get to the airport in a cab the next day 
2; Went for festive afternoon tea and considered it to be good value and worth the visit. A glass of prosecco on arrival followed by a good selection of sandwiches, pastries and scones all of which were very enjoyable. Service was good and we were asked on several ocassions if we required more tea etc.... My only negative comment is that in total there were about ten people taking afternoon tea in the restaurant which was far too large and therefore lacked atmosphere, with so few people surely they could find a smaller room. 
2; Stayed for 1 night, dbb, in a twin room with my sister and my 6- month old. We received excellent service from the receptionist and restaurant staff. Really friendly and couldn't do enough to help. We ate dinner (reservation needed), the food was great. The service was slow and there seemed to be problems with the computer system. We weren't rushing so it didn't cause us problems but 2 other tables left before they were served. Breakfast was buffet with the ability to order items such as porridge, kippers and veggie sausages.  Our twin room was ok. Great big tv and was clean. It wasn't 4 star though. The bathroom was huge but outdated. Dreadful shower.  So, I would stay again. We didn't hear any noise unlike other guests. The service was good too.  Tip for car park users, arrive as early as possible. We checked in at 4pm and there was only one more space free.   
2; Apart from a slightly disorganised everything was lovely.  More breakfast staff required maybe? No cutlery  Food before coffee Long wait to order Otherwise great visit, cute pub with lots of atmosphere and fab menu.   
2; Always used to use Crowne Plaza until they put their prices up. However, after trying other alternatives we decided that we would pay the extra for the convenience & quality. As always, the food, service and transfers were very good. However, as an IHG customer I was very disappointed to be given a very small, dated room at the end of a corridor and to add insult to injury, the rooms opposite all had plaques on the doors saying IHG Club Member. I suppose I should have asked for a room change, but it was late and we'd had a nightmare journey down the M56 and I just couldn't be bothered to back down to reception and queue up again. We would use the Crowne Plaza again but I would not be happy to pay the price we did for an inferior room. 
2; Hotel was clean and in a great location. Good value for money. The only problem is the lack of bag storage facilities. I remember now why I don't stay at Travelodge. Its a shame really because everything else about the hotel is spot on. 
2; We went to an event here for my husband's work party. We had a lovely time at the event and the food was good, although not the best (I had the vegetarian option and was hungry after - soup was good though!) The room we stayed in was small but adequate and the shower head was too far forward and wet my styled hair when I wanted a quick freshen up which then wet the bathroom too, but what most impressed me was breakfast. There was a great and very generous variety of hot and cold items and the staff were friendly too. We then went for a walk and the grounds are superb, outside would be great for wedding pictures with the ancient trees and river. 
2;" We had room 8, second floor, right at the end. It had a nice big double bed, with separate mattresses and separate quilts, which suited us fine - no rolling down into the centre, no synchronised turning over required. The quilt was extremely thin, but I was provided with a second one when I asked the next morning. The bed was fairly firm which suited me, but husband found it a bit too hard (better than too soft, though). There was a window into the garden, so it was very quiet. Maybe less so in summer as there is restaurant/bar seating in the garden. There was no wardrobe, just an alcove with a rail with 6 hangers and space for 8. The bathroom had a heated towel rail which supposedly could be switched on by the guest, but it did not work. Neither did the heated mirror work. There was a large bath with an overhead shower, something I absolutely detest. This meant having a bath which, of course, takes quite a while to run and no possibility of using a handheld shower to wash my hair. Husband was happy enough with the shower. The basin was the first basin ever I could not wash my hair in without assistance - not enough space under the tap and, as there was no plug, no way of filling the basin for a wash. The lighting in the bathroom is dire, only overhead lighting and fairly dim, even with everything on. There is no way one can put on makeup while looking in the mirror due to the shadows cast. And the lighting in the bedroom is just as dim. There was no heating the first night and the following morning, even though the outside temperature was below 10degC with a nasty wind. The second evening the heating had been put on, but was left on far too late and then came on quite late the next morning. Then it was off again for the last night/morning. This being an old building, there is only single glazing on the windows. I could have lived without central heating, but not without any heating in the bathroom as the promised underfloor heating did not work either. The wifi was somewhat variable due to the thick walls. There was a wireless extender box at the stairs one floor down and a chair on the half landing. I guess if one sat on that chair it would be fine. Wifi in the bar area worked better on one side than on the other. Breakfast was very good. The salty porridge was nicely grainy, not the sludge one gets in a lot of places. We would go back, but would definitely ask for a different room; one we glanced in on the way past even had a window in the bathroom (which we did not). We stayed the last weekend in September. "
2;" I was really impressed by the location of this hotel, and thought it was very good value. It's close to the main shopping area, as well as a variety of restaurants, pubs and clubs.   The entrance was very small, and I imagine it could get a bit cosy if the hotel was particularly busy! Luckily for us, we checked in on a Friday morning and there was nobody else around. The staff on the front desk were polite and helpful, and check-in was quick.  The room was pleasant, a fairly decent size with a decent bathroom. The bedroom area was separately from the bathroom by a wall, which I liked. It was comfortable and the quality of the room was comparable to that I have seen in much more expensive hotels. There was a desk and a radio with an iPod dock, which I thought was a nice touch.  The bathroom was quite small, but had everything you need. I wouldn't attempt to get more than one person in there at a time though, which may result in a few arguments when you're getting ready!  Despite the great rooms, there were two things that happened at this hotel which we felt let them down. Firstly, we had booked a room included breakfast from the Expedia website, but when we went down in the morning to eat, we were told that the rate was room only. It was mistake of Expedia, who we booked through, but the attitude of the staff did make us feel a little bit awkward. I was adamant I had paid for a rate including breakfast, but wanted to make sure before I questioned it. I got the confirmation up on my phone, and it did specify that breakfast was included. Despite this, the staff member on the front desk said he would speak to Expedia and asked us to return to discuss the outcome. I can understand the hotel being cautious, it did make us feel a bit uncomfortable.  Secondly, the fire alarm went off at 6am. Again, I can't really blame the hotel for this, as it's a health and safety requirement, and I'd be writing a slightly more harsh review had there been a fire and the alarm hadn't gone off! It was just a bit unfortunate. We stood outside for about 45 minutes while they checked the alarm and sent us all back inside. Not ideal on a Saturday morning!  I don't hold the hotel responsible for this though (however, I would like to remind my fellow travellers that &quot;no smoking&quot; means exactly that, and having a crafty fag in the toilet does not mean you are exempt from the rule!), and I still enjoyed my stay.   Incidentally, the breakfast was nice and there was plenty of choice, even though we ate quite late (about 9:40am) and I would recommend eating there if you can get a good rate. If you buy breakfast separately, the cost is absolutely extortionate, and there are plenty of cheaper, alternative places nearby.  I would recommend this hotel if you are planning on visiting Nottingham city centre, but please make sure you have a copy of your confirmation if you don't book it directly through their website! "
2;We stayed at this hotel for one night at the end of April. Great location, just 2 minutes from Euston station. Arrived at 12, we couldnt check in until 2 but the concierge kept out luggage until it was time to check in. Very helpful and professional staff. Room was clean and tidy with everything you would require for an overnight stay, bathroom was very spacious with an excellent shower. The room was located on the front of the hotel, the only problem being you can hear the train annoucements being made as the station is directly opposite the hotel. Breakfast was lovely despite how long we had to wait to be seated. Check out was 12 however our train wasnt until later that afternoon so the hotel kept our bags for us again. Overall very good hotel
2; Stayed here for 1 night before day at the theme park and it is a fantastic location for the park. Rooms were fine, little cramped, there were 2 adults and 2 children,we had 2 double beds that weren't really all that comfy. Ate in the resturant in the evening and the food was fine, probably a bit overpriced for what you get, great for kids though, they have little train tables all over the bar/resturant area which keeps the kids well amused. There weren't any trains on them though so be sure your little one takes their own with them to play on it. Breakfast was fine, reception was very busy at check in and check out though, didn't seem to have enough staff on. Lovely decking area out the back of the hotel with a play area for the kids.  The best thing about this hotel is location, not so sure it's 4 star though. 
2; Just got home from a 2 day stay here and the hotel was really lovely. I was dubious as I have high expectations but the hotel was well maintained with nice fixtures and fittings. Kids loved the Triumph bar with the motorcycle. Breakfast was pretty average, not enough choice for children unless they like toast and rice krispies everyday. Some flavoured yogurt would have been nice. The pool area was very nice- although small. Only downside is there is no shallow end. The lowest is 4 foot 6 I think so had to hold my 2 children the entire time- not fun! Beds were nice but the pillows were awful! Also the shower is ridiculous. Took ages as the water pressure is so low I could have spit more water at that rate. Loved the kids body wash included. The pizza at Triumph was average- very expensive. All in all a good time to be had.. Oh- on a side note: The hotel was refurbishing the floors in the Rotunda- made for an awful smell. Could not have been very healthy breathing this in all day... 
2; The hotel looks fantasttic and the rooms were the best I have ever stayed in (I loved the shower!). I would have given the hotel a 5/5 rating if it wasn't for the quality of food and service received in the hotels restaurant Gallucci's. We paid £70 for one of the worst meals I have ever tasted - the chefs were far more interested in the presentation then the taste. The livers were undercooked and the Red Mullet was over cooked!! So I recommend the hotel for an overnight stay before flying from Gatwick (remember to book a place on the courtesy bus to the airport when you check in). But make the short walk into Crawley if you want a meal - unless you are happy to be overcharged for a meal that a 5 years old could cook better!  
2;This was an anniversary weekend. The hotel is fab, with lots of attention to detail and attentive staff. Our anniversary meal in The Brasserie was sadly disappointing. My husband ordered the halibut for his main course. He asked for the langoustine to be held as he does not eat shellfish. The dish was served as a starter size, very small piece of halibut. We would have expected chef to have either added another piece of halibut, or at least to suggest we chose another option. My main course was a delicious steak. I insisted my husband shared my steak as his dish looked so insubstantial. At Breakfast on Sunday we had to cue for about 20 mins for a table and then wait for plates and food stamps the buffet.. Might have been better to provide a private dining room for the wedding party to have their breakfast? The staff were very helpful throughout and our room was very spacious and overlooking the airfield which is a must for this hotel. We even had a Happy Anniversary gift and card from hotel in our room. Such a shame that our dining experience prevented us from giving 5 stars.
2; First impression was fantastic greeting when we arrived. This continued throughout our stay. Good hospitality is about interactions with people and all the staff were very pleasant and engaging from reception, to breakfast team and porters. Room was small ( I knew this on booking and not uncommon in London) but clean, fresh and well appointed. The Hotel is on a beautiful road set back and no traffic noise so a great sleep in a comfy bed. Less than 5 mins walk to the beautiful Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate tube. Will definitely recommend. Only missing 5 stars due to little details , room/shower room size and duvet a little small for the bed. Will definitely return . 
2; The service was excellent and the food was good. The coffee was too strong and the musicians were very lazy they played a few tunes and took a break and after an other couple of tunes went off duty. The place is lovely unfortunately there were hardly any people, parking was easy and everyone was very helpful from reception to the restaurant 
2; Stayed for one night at the end of January on a Saturday night.  A very clean and tidy hotel with modern rooms. A nice touch of a fresh cookie on arrival and the iMac in the rooms is great - even if it took a while for me to work out how to make it work as a TV! Some noise from the room next to us during the night, rang reception and was dealt with quickly.  A tip: this hotel seems to be in an area which at the weekend is deserted! Excellent free on road parking within five minutes walk of Westminster (charged parking during the week). 
2; We stayed here for the night while in London to see the mighty Bruce Springsteen at Wembley! The hotel is ideally placed for arriving at Paddington station and is literally just around the corner. We arrived approx 40 minutes before the designated check-in time of 3.00pm and although our room wasn't ready, we were still able to complete the check-in process and asked to return in approx half an hour to collect our room key. All the staff we encountered at the hotel during our stay were very polite and friendly. Our room was clean and well-presented. The huge comfy bed was very much appreciated after an energetic evening at Wembley. We had no problems with noise but maybe we were lucky as the front of the hotel is on a very busy street and the railway station is at the back! We would definately stay here again. 
2; Stayed here for New Years Eve, and had a fabulous time!! One particular receptionist (sorry can't remember her name) was very friendly when we arrived asking how we were, if we had plans etc). The room was great - only thing I wasn't keen on is the 'king bed' was actually two singles put together!! Not comfortable if you turn over and fall in the crack! Also unfortunately we had some loud people on the floor, but this was of no fault of the hotel!! 
2; I stayed here overnight with a friend whilst attending a conference at the NEC. Everything was the high standard I have come to expect from a Hilton hotel but the evening meal was something else entirely. When I hear 'all you can eat buffet', I tend to think of quantity rather than quality - however, the evening buffet in this hotel was amazing. The quality of the food was top notch, more akin to an expensive restaurant, and the service was second to none. The desserts were all made on site by 'Jerry and the pastry makers' and were delicious. At £28 per person, initially it seems on the expensive side but compare that to approximately £25 each for starter and main in the bar, it is incredible value. Even if you're not staying at the hotel, I highly recommend eating in the restaurant.  The only negatives about the hotel are my usual pet gripes about almost every hotel I stay in - not enough tea/coffee/sugar/milk in the rooms and the showers weren't the best, although adequate. 
2;" We stayed at 'Calcot Manor Hotel and Spa' for 3 nights. Originally, it supposed to be for only two nights, but we liked it so much so decided to extend. There are a few exciting things about this place worth mentioning.  First, the look of the hotel building reminds you of fairytale houses from a few centuries ago. For me, it does, I believe. The interior continues the fairytale mood, with a great touch of freshness and design.  Every corner inside the hotel reflects history and style. It’s like walking into a museum, viewing old maps of England, there are mirrors decorated with sea-shells, antiques with modern furniture and so on.  The hotel restaurant provided us with friendly staff and a romantic atmosphere. Since we were on a diet, we just ordered some amazing side dishes from the chef. And their green garden tomatoes and fresh salad leaves are simply delicious. Also, the restaurant has a wide range of wines from all over the world.  We had a top floor room, with both hotel and the side stairs access. The room was quite bright and spacious. It follows the same concept as the hotel design, with slight changes of colour and style. The bathroom had both a shower and a bath.  The weakness of the room is the absence of a refrigerator and mini bar; also, there is no bottled water provision.   Then, the Spa. It is located in a separate building, a few metres apart from the Hotel.  The really ‘Wow’ effect is when you come to the Spa tea/breakfast lounge, with a glass wall facing an amazing hot tub and fireplace. The Hot tub is the most desirable ‘shelter' to hide from the cold chilly weather. The same romance is created by the fireplace, which is fed with the rich smell of cedar wood logs.  The swimming pool is big and warm; it is almost always empty, so swimming lovers like me can enjoy it. The steam room and sauna are quite small but big enough for the size of the hotel.   For those who like spa massage treatments, I would strongly recommend booking appointments in advance as it’s almost impossible to find any free massage sessions on the same day, or and even if calling a day before. "
2; This is our third stay at this hotel and it could not be more convenient if arriving by train. Handy for the Metro & the City centre shops. Since our last stay Bonbar has opened next door & if you are a light sleeper the Friday beats night might be an issue! Not a problem just pack some ear plugs.  Room & breakfast are both excellent so if you are staying here for the night life the noise would not be an issue. 
2;The hotel was very well placed, as a central spot to see the rest of the city, with easy access to tubes etc. The staff were very polite and helpful and we enjoyed a very pleasant weekend stay.
2; Stayed overnight as attending nearby function. Room was comfortable and clean and the staff efficient. Although we did not have breakfast, had coffee and cake in the lounge which was good. Rate reasonable. Would recommend. 
2; The hotel hasn't been open long and there are some minor issues that need addressing. The rooms and bathrooms are lovely and well appointed. The only thing missing in the room is an information pack about facilities/menus which would be useful. The reception staff were very welcoming and helpful. Sadly the lift wasn't working and it was quite a struggle with suitcases to the second floor. My major issue is, having invited some friends to join me for afternoon tea we went to the bar/restaurant and asked for a table and we're just told to go and find somewhere to sit, but not in the restaurant as it was closed. I couldn't see anywhere available and asked the waitress where she suggested,she gave a big sigh and found us sofas away from the main area. I would have hoped that as a resident paying for two rooms I wouldn't have been treated as such an inconvenience. Maybe a better approach would have been to ask if I were a resident and then find me a table within the (closed) restaurant without the big sigh. That said, I will return and hope that this girl is given further training, reminding her just what her job is and who ultimately pays her wages! The only other awkward thing is the lack of parking, maybe the hotel could make an arrangement with the council where hotel guests could park in one of the nearby car parks for longer than 3 hours with a special permit - even if it costs the guest. 
2; We stayed on a Saturday. It was easy to book online and the price for a double room and breakfast/wifi was reasonable. The hotel is just off the M25 so a great location that was easy to access. The receptionist was pleasant and friendly and made us feel very welcome. We were able to check in earlier than 3pm which was great. She reminded us to log our car registration number to avoid charges (Our parking was complimentary).   There are no lifts but help was offered to take our case upstairs. The corridors seem a bit old fashioned and dark but the room itself was bright, modern, well lit and comfortable. It had everything we needed.  There is a spacious and modern seating area in reception. It is a comfortable and relaxing place to sit and chat. Breakfast was fine with plenty of choice and good service. Checkout was easy and again, the receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Wifi was easy to access and a good speed compared to other hotels.  Overall, I would recommend. 
2; As many other reviewers have said this is a well situated easily accessible functional hotel with good public transport links that is ideal for the business traveller but perhaps a little souless and bland for those wanting a more romantic experience. The rooms are a trifle claustrophobic but are fully equipped and the housekeeping standards appear high. Reception/concierge staff are pleasant and knowledgeable. Breakfast is perfectly adequate but steer clear of the Hotel restaurant - there are several good Mediterranean/ Greek/ Indian eateries of good standard and reasonably priced within spitting distance. There is an attached Conference facility which makes for a busy lobby most of the time. Having stayed here a few times recently the room uptake rate seems high so you will be lucky to get a reduced cost deal.  
2; We had our wedding at Mercure Parkside hotel in July 2014. We found the overall look of the place tasteful. The manager that dealt with our wedding meals was very good. The food was served quickly so that the guests were not waiting long.the food was nice and the drinks often topped up. We found on the taster night of the food before the wedding we could only taste one meal, dessert, drink on the menu. If you wanted to taste more you needed to pay extra. I requested water jugs on all guests tables but was first told by the wedding co ordinator that they do not normally provide this. This was quickly sorted by the hotel manager and we was then allowed this. We found the overall experience a lovely day . 
2; Booked this hotel for December 2016 as we got a fantastic deal earlier in the year. Otherwise I would not have paid the normal price for the hotel. There is not a lot around the hotel so unless you want to get taxis places, be prepared to stay in. The hotel bar had a great Christmas atmosphere with the disco being on. Staff were lovely and friendly.   Only downside to staying over was that we had terrible noisy neighbours so we wanted to call reception to ask them if they could have a word with them. However we could not find the direction number to the reception on the telephone! They had every number but that one. Therefore we had to get ready and go down to the reception to complain. The receptionist was lovely and sorted the problem for us. If there is a number on the telephone for reception this should be made more clear.  
2; Having been to the races on St Patricks day with a friend was very disappointed with the music played at the Hotel, as most of the clientel were Irish would have been nice to have had some Traditional Irish music . Staff were lovely very helpful , nice clean Hotel, 
2; Negative. The firealarm. During Saturday evening we went into the lift there was a group of boys and girls one with a bottle of wine in her hand. I do not expect to see this at a childrens hotel. When I went to the grill for dinner I noticed there was a big function on staff do. when we went to bed that night we were woken up by a firealarm. there was nobody to tell us what was going on you had some people still in rooms and some people all crowded on the staircase going up and down holding babys the lot. at the bottom of our staircase and only ours there were 2 people in drayton manor hotel waterproof jackets these were the same people I had seen go out of the hotel with a bottle of wine by there side.they said they did not work here at the hotel but at the park but just guests trying to help. they stunk of alchahol. if you are not working at the hotel but work at the theme park and it is your night off please keep out of the way when there is a potential fire . when I waited at the reception to talk to someone I had a blonde woman talk to me that works for drayton theme park but not the hotel taking numbers. she STANK of alchahol!!!!!! and was taking someones number worst of all she was chatting to my son. I am still to wait to talk to somebody about it I now have to wait till Friday when the manager is in so have had no choice but to write this review.   Positive Points. Beautiful hotel. Tastefully Thomas themed with lovely little touches. Arrived on the friday night and stayed until the monday morning. Breakfast was lovely however one day it was quite cold. Not all items out but if you asked for yoghurts etc they would bring them to your table. Room was lovely and clean. We had one meal one night in the grill, relaxed atmosphere with big portions and my ceaser salad was spot on. The last night we ate at the hotel restaurant my risotto was beautiful and meal time was easy as in the hotel and restaurant there are Thomas train tables which the children go off and play on for hours on end so you can relax and have a few drinks. The Saturday we spent in Thomas land and the zoo fantastic and spent a full on day there. The sunday we went to Cadbury land and spent 5 hours there another brilliant attraction and shopping in the afternoon at the bullring (Disney shop is a must). That evening we went to the hotel childrens entertainment in the carasouel bar... it's okay but the room is not really designed for children to be in it. The tables have a glass top and it Is small just waiting for a glass drink to be knocked over or children to knock into someone carrying drinks.   We had a lovely time and would of been 5 * such a shame. 
2; I wanted to put in a good word for this hotel because when I stayed there this last week with a friend, I'd booked online (not directly with the hotel), and omitted to say I needed a twin room, not a double. When we checked in the Reception sorted this - and we were put in an upgraded room, for no extra money, that had two queen beds and a lounge area and two TVs and a bathrobe and slippers.:) :) :)  I thought this was very good customer service.  I can also recommend this hotel for those wanting to have immediate access to Durham city, as it's right at the foot of the 'island', and you just cross the road to get to the bridge that leads up into the main city centre (it's a lovely little 'city' and you can see it all, including the magnificent cathedral, in a day - lots of little cafes tucked away, often 'down steps' or 'upstairs' - it's a very up and down place!)(and I recommend the Lebanese restaurant Lebaneat, en route to the cathedral!)  The Mariott also has a car park (very useful in Durham!), and although a space is not guaranteed for residents, I've never not found one. The charge is £5 a night for residents. You can put more money in the next day after check out, to save you moving the car to the Bishop's public carpark.  One minor carp is that even in the superior room we were upgraded to, there is no free Wifi, which I find odd in this day and age - however, there is free wifi downstairs in the lobby, and in the attached Starbucks coffee shop.  The leisure centre/pool attached looked very good - pretty well equipped gym (for a hotel), and pretty pool (but not for laps!). Alas, no kit with us, so couldn't use it.   The hotel gets very (very!) booked out at the start of the academic year in particular (Durham is a university city, and loads of students everywhere!), and at graduation in the summer. 
2;This hotel is very central, close to Euston station and local transport. This hotel is very comfortable we picked a room away from the road and it was very quiet. The staff are so helpful and the breakfast was delicious.
2;We stayed and ate here so this review covers both.  Bar good was absolutely brill. Basic pub grub menu but everything was done very well and the staff were attentive. Special mention for the young blonde male waiter who should be promoted to head of something with those hospitality skills!! He dealt with our large and rowdy group with ease!!  The hotel is well run by the staff. Again, special thanks to Kate who made our stay smooth from start to finish and always with a smile on her face. The rooms are tired though. Comfy beds, lovely linen but tired bathrooms and carpets. Could do with a face lift to get top marks!!  However, both food and accommodation represent great value for money. It comes highly recommended by me and my fellow 10 travel companions!!!
2; Staff were fabulous - very helpful. The room was absolutely gorgeous, overlooking the river Thames and spacious and very comfortable. The leisure spa was lovely. My only concern was I paid for 3 course dinner at £29.00. Very limited choice (just one meat, one fish, one vegetarian) which was too short in my view. In my view the food was disappointing, but the service was fantastic yet again. The breakfast food was pre-cooked, but was very well presented and again superb staff. Definitely will return - but will try the bar or a different menu at supper (wasn't made aware that there was one until the sweet). 
2; Attended my friends wedding reception here and stayed over the night!  Beautiful wedding venue!   Quick & friendly check in (especially as there were quite a few wedding guests checking in at once)   We had two separate rooms in the main house and both very lovely, good size & clean.   You have to go outside to get through to the restaurant for breakfast but we had a lovely selection.   The only negative feedback is that I found bar staff incredibly rude! The girl behind the downstairs bar in the evening was unfriendly and in the morning we say in the bar (it may be called library?) and when I asked for 2 coffees the man behind the bar really acted like I was totally inconveniencing him.   I would say if they worked on the customer service it would be amazing.    
2; We stayed one night because our son had an audition in Brighton. The rooms had a fabulous sea view and the hotel is in a great position. The decor was modern and in good condition, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was first class. There were just a couple of niggles. The french doors that opened onto the balcony didn't close tight so the traffic noise could be heard clearly in the room. Room service was ok - the soup I ordered wasn't quite as expected and the delivery person didn't bring any cash change for bill payment and so had to go away and come back again! Also we couldn't log onto the wifi - the concierge tried to resolve the problem but there was a possibility it was our laptop security and for one night it wasn't worth spending too long resolving the issue. Overall a good value hotel in a wonderful town. 
2; A lovely 'old fashioned' hotel set in quiet parkland with easy access to M5 & M50 motorways, on the edge of the Cotswolds. A fine restaurant & helpful staff. Rooms very comfortable but need air conditioning in hot waether (not installed). On site 18 hole golf course & fitness centre / pool etc. Would definately use again. 
2; Nice hotel about ten minutes walk to the city centre, staff friendly. Hotel far too hot, room was extremely hot with window open couldn't work the thermostat, didn't spoil too much as we did not spend much time in the hotel. Breakfast was lovely, plenty of selection from cereal to croissants to cooked breakfast buffet. Would return 
2; Nice hotel in a great location. Room was good size and had a fantastic view. Enjoyed using the therapy pool after my long walk up Helm Crag.  All together a nice place to say with easy reach to other attractions. 
2; I have stayed at this hotel a number of times, and while I would stay again, I don't think that the hotel is as good as it was.  Rooms are a reasonable size and clean. I agree with a previous post about the lighting being inadequate.   Breakfast is not as good as it once was, The choice may be there, but the quality is not as good.  Lifts seem to have a mind of there own, and you can wait over 10 minutes quite often just to get a lift.  The staff here though make the difference. They are always very friendly and helpful. 
2; Lovely weather enhanced the beautiful grounds of this hotel. Friendly staff who gave us coffee while our room was prepared (we were early). Large, comfortable room with 2 armchairs and well-placed lighting. Leisure facilities excellent and even on a Friday evening there were exercise machines to spare. We were given accurate information on local attractions and the bus service to Chester. As an almost-vegetarian I wasn't too impressed with the variety of food on offer in the restaurant but, as always, breakfast was delicious, with a fantastic array of buffet food. Restaurant service was pleasant and efficient. 
2;I stayed in this hotel with my 83 year old mother when we came to London to see War Horse. The staff were very courteous and helpful, the breakfast was good and the room was very attractive and intelligently designed. For a short stay, the wardrobe storage is ample and beautifully descrete, as is the desk. We shared a twin room on the 3rd floor. It was quiet both from the outside and from the corridor. I would definately stay again if needing a hotel in London.
2; We were very impressed with the Ramada Southport, it is well worth a visit. The hotel is situated next to the lake and a short walk to the lovely shopping centre and train Station. The food is good but was slightly let down by the service on two evenings which was very random. The third evening it was mostly a change of staff and was excellent service, all very efficient. 
2; Spent a very enjoyable Christmas 3 night break at Chesford Grange, The setting is lovely, the hotel is stylish and the staff were very efficient and friendly.The bedrooms are spacious, comfortable and have everything you need including a complementary box of chocolates which was a very welcome seasonal gesture.Although the meals were set menus, the quality was good and the waiting and catering staff did a sterling job in managing such large numbers of guests. I particularly liked the bar area where there were plenty of discreet and cosy areas with log fires. My only adverse comment is the entertainment which was disappointing. Karaoke, Play Your Cards Right and Bingo don't really fit with the charm and style of this hotel. Something more tasteful would have been welcome. 
2;stayed at The radisson Grafton earlier this week with 3 teenagers! enjoy the size and cleaness of the rooms, brilliant staff service, couldn't be faulted. lovely breakfast. very helpful service of being allowed to leave bags pre- and after check in/out. great location just a stones throw from city centre, ideal for main railway stations and visiting British museum and shopping areas. great bus and tube very close by.  only niggle was size of TV and lack of channels would of expected at least freeview but only got 5 basic plus a few other random.
2; I held my birthday party at the Dolphin hotel (Mercure). We met at the hotel first, went on a treasure hunt around old Southampton and then back to the Dolphin for afternoon tea. We had the Jane Austin suite which is a beautiful room. Although there were some minor glitches (e.g. initially we were one table short) the hotel staff were very quick to rectify an problems. The food delicious, the service excellent and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The price was very reasonable. It was a great birthday party. 
2; This hotel is situated in wonderful groups and the building is very interesting.  The staff are fantastic, their customer service is second to none. They really made our Granddaughter's Birthday weekend very very special! With special attention paid to her by all staff. We noticed this applied to another child whose birthday was at the same time.  The food at breakfast was plentiful and amazing, cooked to perfection and plenty of variety. Not the same can be said about the evening meal though. The slow cooked Pork was hard and dry. So why have I given a review of very good? Well this is because the hotel is most definitely NOT disabled friendly! Yes there are two totally equipped disabled rooms that are more than adequate, however they are down 2 very steep sets of stairs and the so called disabled ramps DO NOT comply with the health and safety or disabled regulations. They are nothing short of dangerous! I actually fell out of my wheelchair and hurt my arm on one of the ramps! Come on Royal Berkshire Hotel sort this regulation out and comply with the law! 
2;The reception on arrival was pleasant and professional. The room was lovely, very clean and well decorated. It was quite spacious with good quality furnishings. The downside was that the bed was a little too soft for my preference and the air conditioning unit was quite noisy. However the biggest downside was the fact that we were on 24th floor and above us was the restaurant and the champagne bar which was very busy and which had a live music event which went on to 2am. If we had realised that this would be the case we would probably have found somewhere else to stay as we are perhaps a little too old for the kind of music we could hear through the ceiling. The upshot was that I did not sleep particularly well. We had breakfast on the 25th Floor in the MPW restaurant. The view was spectacular and you will be surprised by how much greenery you can see in Birmingham. The service at breakfast was faultless and the food was excellent. We both had the Eggs Benedict which very moreish. The buffet was generous with an excellent range of food on offer. The staff were attentive but unobtrusive. Despite the disturbance of the music, I would stay again although probably not at a weekend. The hotel is lively and obviously a popular venue which we had expected, we just had not planned for the live music. I would certainly recommend the hotel to those wanting to be central to the hustle and bustle of the city but perhaps for the younger market. We cannot fault the staff, the service or the cleanliness of the hotel.
2; We had a ball in the venue so decided to stay at the hotel.   The room was ok- we got an executive suite- though not nearly as spacious as was advertised.   There was access to the Executive Lounge which had breakfast there- with a decent spread.   The staff were polite and friendly. 
2; I recently stayed at this hotel for a romantic night away with my boyfriend. We had dinner and breakfast which was very nice and the staff were very friendly. Our disappointment was we paid to upgrade to a kings size room and the bed was two singles together zipped together and they were slightly different heights. It was a really uncomfortable night sleep. Other than that this hotel has lovely soap facilities. 
2; Stayed here with my partner for a night during a short break to Brighton. Excellent location, and reasonably priced (midweek stay). Staff were helpful and no problems with the room at all. The car park is small so definitely needed to book in advance. I would stay again when next in Brighton. 
2; We stayed in a classic room which was a standard hotel room of a decent size. The in room safe didn't work though. The spa area is very good with a decent sized pool, steam room and hot tub. The men's sauna wasn't working while we were there and the ladies wasn't all that hot.  At breakfast some of the hot buffet food was cold, not helped by cold plates even though they were in a warmer. We had dinner one evening. Food was good except my main course was served on a cold plate. When asked twice by waiting staff if the meal was alright, I told both of them about this issue and their 'standard' reply was 'Thank you'!! 
2;As we have builders in at home my partner and i decided to have a nice quiet night away, We saw a good deal with travel zoo so we booked it as we have stayed at the majestic before and enjoyed it. We arrived at the hotel at 2pm so we could check in and use the spa BUT! Our room was still been cleened so the lovely receptionist arranged for us to have complimentry coffee in the bar while we wait. After coffee and reading newspapers cover to cover i decided to go investigate to be told i am very very sorry it shouldnt be long now.. I was dosapointed as our day was passing us by. So rether than wait i asked if i could pay to upgrade which i did and we got our room key streight away. Our room was on the 3rd floor which we thought would be nice and quiet.... And as we are not going to have time to use the spa we decided we would have a little nap before we go out, It was impossible, Cleeners still banging doors and vacuming at 3.30 in the afternoon. Guests coming into theire rooms banging doors which i might add are on a very strong return spring and made a hell of a noise if wasnt closed carefully.  We decided not to have a nap and got ready to go out. We came back to the hotel for evening dinner in the main dining room the staff were very nice and so was the food.  After coffee we went to bed. 11oclock ish.. at 12ish the nightmare began.. Bang Bang Bang doors banging all over the place. The fire doors had been closed and every time anybody came through the one on our side or the otherside it woke us up and then the roomdoor slaming this went on till 4am in the morning. Guests voices were noisy which the hotal is not responsible for. At 4am we had a cup of tea and thought about going home as we only live 30mins away. We decided to stay and have breakfast which i might add was beautiful. We had a late check out but didnt use it as the hotel was a hive of activity and we just wanted QUIET!!! So we checked out. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED...
2; The rooms are lovely, beautifully presented, comfortable massive bed, bathroom is contemporary and practical (once we worked out you had to hold in the light switch to adjust the dimmer)   Lobby and restaurant/bar areas all look great.  The breakfast is where this place falls down. You find yourself a table and help yourself to the food as usual but tea and coffee is table service, if you can attract a member of staff that is! The selection of food is quite large and all of a reasonable quality but they are disorganised with staffing areas. Tables were not cleaned or laid up when busy so we had to sit at a table that had not been cleaned, we would have asked but after the 15mins it took to get a coffee it hardly seemed worth it as we had already began to eat.   Overall the most important part is the room and that was great. 
2; We stayed there over a night, staff at the reception was lovely and helpful -girl called Zoe. Room was simple and quite small but clean and bed was very comfortable. Location is good as it's close to town and train station.Shame there was no bath only shower. You also have to pay for parking. 
2; lovely hotel very near to motorway ,lovely rooms very clean checked in very smoothly great christmas party night ,live band, disco, magician,really great party .Food was very good ,hot dogs at midnight if you felt peckish ,didnt hear any noise during the night so slept well room lovely and warm. 
2; Excellent location close to Buckingham palace. Very helpful staff - had a courtesy call from Jackie to check any special requirements prior to our stay. Breakfast was included in the price and was extensive. Clean throughout and lovely decor. We had 2 double rooms and they differed greatly in size, ours was on the small size. Was disappointed that there were no proper drawers but there was plenty of hanging space. 
2; Very enjoyable stay, Staff very helpful and friendly. The room Belize we stayed in was amazing and very romantic! Service with a smile at all times. Room was clean and fresh. We Enjoyed it very much a very good start to married life . We Would recommend to friends and family and would revisit in the future thats for sure 
2; We visted for an overnight spa break, having been before just for drinks. The hotel spa is great. The treatments are reasonably priced within the spa package and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We dined in the hotel restaurant and ate a wonderful duck dish followed by a good cheeseboard. We had breakfast he following morning in the restaurant. Again the staff were helpful and attentive. Sadly the bar service left a lot to be desired. On our first day we ordered afternoon tea. After 45 minutes waiting and a reminder at the bar (by me), it arrived. Profuse apologies....we weren't in a rush as we were staying so it was ok. However the following day as part of our spa package, we were due to have lunch, again in the bar. Again, appauling service. Perhaps they are understaffed..A wedding was going on and the two chaps on duty seemed to be running from serving wedding guests in the adjoining bar to the other lunchtime guests. Our lunch arrived after an hour and wasn't that great (goats cheese, kale and beetroot served with no eye to presentation or dressing). This did mar what had been a lovely stay and would stop me giving the place 4 or even 5 stars. If they sort out the staffing and management of the bar perhaps the visitor experience would be greatly improved. We weren't the only ones to be kept waiting.... 
2; Storrs hall is a charming old stately home. Full of antiques it's a bit tired in decor but has old world charm and we really enjoyed our walk in the grounds overlooking lake Windermere  One thing noted - there is no proviso ion for disabled guests as no lifts to upper levels  Service was friendly and attentive and rooms we're comfortable and well appointed clean and with lovely views. Our sleep was disturbed however by a barking dog in the room next door  We ate both nights in the restaurant which was slightly chilly. Portions of food were small and quality was variable and we felt you could get better value and quality elsewhere     
2;Myself and my boyfriend booked to stay for 2 nights on the winter special which was fantastic value for money. The hotel itself is lovely and staff are all very friendly and helpful. We didn't eat in the restaurant but did get room service one night which was lovely.   The breakfast however was a different matter, we ate in the restaurant each morning and the service was not only slow but the quality was also poor. Each morning there were only 2 members of staff which meant on the first morning we had our pot of tea after we had eaten breakfast, the second time we never received it at all!  There was always a queue waiting for hot food and whenever anything was brought out the quantity was so small it would go again before the queue had even gone down. I therefore skipped hot food altogether on the second morning, although on the first morning it was quite greasy anyway so not sure I missed much.   It was obvious that lack of staff was the problem for some reason as even the juices were only refilled when somebody complained.   One thing I think is lacking in the hotel is air conditioning - It was so hot everywhere you went, particularly in the room itself to the point it was uncomfortable.  All in all, we had a lovely time minus the breakfast which was a disappointment.
2; my husband and I stayed 13/12/2014 traveling with coach party of 32, room was clean and comfortable, bar area is relaxing, staff are very friendly only thing I would say if you want a table for two at breakfast make sure you go down early or manager wants to sit with people you don't know this is not suitable for couples wanting a quiet breakfast alone other than that no complaints. 
4; Stayed here the night before Ascot this week. Excellent choice all round. We had a car to park so entered the hotel from the back entrance. You come up to the ground floor at the back of the restaurant. A waiter and manager stopped whatever they were doing, immediately greeted me, took my bags and walked me to reception. It was 7 pm, in service and they were busy. This initial great customer service continued throughout our stay. Lovely receptionist, excellent restaurant service. I had a disaster as had forgotten my hairbrush. The hotel found out which shops were open late for me and were really apologetic they didn't have one to hand to give me!  The food in the restaurant was fantastic all round. On departure, on our way to Ascot both the receptionists and the valet complimented all 5 ladies in my party on our hats and outfits and wished us lots of luck at the races.  I don't know if the hotel is recently refurbished but the room and all communal areas were tastefully decorated and to a high standard- looked new throughout. To top it off, the hotel s directly across the road from the castle, right in the middle of town- excellent location, excellent standards, food, staff and service, no wonder this place is winning awards! 
4; Wonderful hotel with excellent, friendly staff, good facilities particuarly the library which is well stocked. Varied menu in the restaurant both for dinner and breakfast - & they very kindly upgraded me. Looking forward to my next visit.... 
4;" A great four day stay, from the rooms to the service; I can only say it was a wonderful stay! The outdoor pool with the presence of sunshine was better than the Med. The restaurant, food and service was excellent, in particular Liam our young, charming waiter made our stay memorable! "
4; Excellent customer service, good online booking facility. Well positioned for access to airport and train station. Brilliant hotel shuttle bus. Excellent dining and coffee bar facilities. Comfortable rooms and spotlessly clean. 
4; I had 5 nights at the Cavendish last week with my son aged 21. What a wonderful time we had. The room was so lovely, we had an Executive Twin on the 7th floor. The beds were so large and comfortable, the bath so deep and the shower one of the best I have ever had. Breakfast was so fresh and tasty and the waiters courteous and smiling at all times. We had one meal in the Lounge area. I had steak and it was mouthwatering. We treated ourselves to a few cocktails, but the Gin and Tonics were the best I have ever had. We extended our stay by one night as we just didn't want to leave and this was dealt with efficiently and immediately with no need to change rooms.  On check out there was an anomaly on the bill, but this was dealt with, without fuss and embarrassment. We left our luggage at the hotel so that we could enjoy our last day to the full. We arrived back after a show, we were attended to without delay. We were asked if we needed a taxi (which we did) and without any second thought the chap on duty walked outside to call one for us.  There was a slight blip the first night in that there was a fire alarm so at around 3am in the morning we all had to troop outside. But it did add to the experience and it was managed in such a professional 'no fuss way'. The offer of a cup of tea on return would have been welcome, but I guess at 3am it would be difficult.  The position of the hotel is ideal. We walked everywhere and we were so close to the West End Shows - we saw 4!  I could go on, but I think you get the idea - it was perfect, and we keep doing the 'this time last week we were.....'. I have stayed there before, but our extended stay allowed us to really relax and really enjoy the Cavendish. I am hoping to go back at New Year with my husband and other son. I couldn't stay anywhere else now. You made the time I had with my son, prior to his return to Cambridge Uni to prepare for his finals, unforgettable in the most positive way.  Well done and since thanks to all at the Cavendish.  p.s. I am REALLY fussy about where I stay and where I eat. 
4; Have stayed at a couple of the Doubletree Hilton hotels before which have always been very good , however the Hilton Deansgate really impressed us. We had an overnight stay whilst visiting our son and found all the staff really helpful and pleasant and made us most welcome. Our room was comfortable, clean and quiet with ample storage space. Clothes could be hung on normal hangers - a joy from the type that every other hotel seem to use now. Bathroom spacious and a decent hairdryer in the room. The floor to ceiling windows add something special to the room and offer great views of the city. We brought along our two dogs who fit the criteria of weighing less than 10kg and this was a real plus enabling us to stay in a great hotel. The hotel had a lovely Christmas feel with lights and tree in the foyer. Check in and out was easy and staff took time to talk and make you feel like a valued guest. We ate at the podium restaurant where the food was excellent. Fillet steaks cooked to perfection and a good choice of wines. The podium is also where breakfast is served and in some ways is more suitable for this rather than a choice of venue for a romantic meal out. Our waitress Ashamarina served us for our evening meal and was excellent. Took the time to answer questions about the hotel, the food and a city we haven't visited before. Absolute credit to the Hilton recruitment and training of staff. Will definitely return to stay here again and planning to make use of the gym and pool next time. 
4; I stayed at this hotel for 1 night and I thoroughly recommend it. Location is excellent and is within walking distance from the train station and underground. Staff were extremely polite and helpful. Rooms are clean and modern The restaurant offers a great menu, with healthy options as well. I will definitely re-book when I am next in London. 
4; We turned up out of the blue for just a quick nights get away and Luckily found the Quorn Hotel! Couldn't of been more at ease there, hotel was lovely people fantastic. We were made to feel very welcome. Breakfast was Lovely. Will definitely visit again. 
4; we stayed here on 20.9.13 our son was checking into the Uni, Paid £45 via Expedia. Spotlessly clean, couldn't be in a better location for the city centre, bars places to eat etc. Hotel offers valet parking for £15 per night which was spot on, dropped car outside hotel they took it away and returned at agreed time next day. Staff professional and helpful. Can't comment on bar etc as we did not use hotel facilities, would stay here again and I will be a regular visitor to Nottingham. 
4; We booked the NYE dinner at the M.C restaurant and after party and it was super! The food was lovely, I was so full I could fall asleep! The service was great and nice attention to detail!!   We also booked a room for the night... We booked a Most Enviable room and once we checked in we were told we were upgraded to the Fabulous suite... It was amazing.. The suite was huge and had an adorable decked roof terrace with stunning views of the cathedral. This is when we decided to not attend the NYE countdown in the ballroom but retreated to the room to watch the firework across Canterbury! Icing on the cake to a perfect evening!   The bed was massive and beyond comfortable.. Did not want to get out of bed ever again! The only mini downside was that the door to the terrace was very hard to open and to close again... And clearly this is an old problem as there was obvious water damage to the door.. but it really did not bother us as the door is nowhere near the bedroom!   If you are looking for the best hotel room in Canterbury and surroundings... this is it!!!  Great stay! 
4; We love the Whitby area and when I received a Macdonald hotel voucher as a gift, we were so pleased to find a hotel in the Whitby area. A booking was made for three night stay. We were made welcome on arrival and were very pleased to be told our bedroom had been upgraded to a room with a four poster bed! Room was lovely and clean with view to the hills. Lovely touches such as bottles of soft drinks etc and even small decanter of sherry. Nice toiletries as well. We had a lovely dinner in the bistro to come upstairs later on to find the bed had been turned down, lights put on and small box of chocolates on the bed. Breakfast was amazing with loads of choice and more than enough to eat. We would love to return again 
4; A large group of us had an amazing stay at this hotel the weekend of 29-31 Jan. The hotel is immaculate and we want to especially thank Rahul and Christos for their amazing customer service and warmth! When we are next in Birmingham we will be sure to stay again at this hotel - great staff, great location, and extremely beautiful hotel. Thank you again!  Lana & David Newby, and from all of us! 
4; We booked this through a deal and we were not disappointed at all. The check in was quick and efficient in beautiful surroundings with the sweeping staircase. Our room was a dockside room and was absolutely beautiful. The bathroom was spotless as was the room. The bed was comfortable and there were two dressing gowns and slippers provided as well. The whole room had a touch of luxury about it.   We had drinks on the deck as the weather was beautiful when we were there. The cocktails were amazing and the service was great.  We had dinner in the restaurant on board and although a little on the pricey side it was well worth it. The food and service were all brilliant. Breakfast was in the main restaurant and there was plenty to choose from. Cereal, pastries, toast, cooked breakfast, smoked salmon and fruit. All delicious.  I cannot fault this yacht at all. We had an amazing weekend. Thank you :-) 
4; Just come back from a short break at the lodore great deal with an upgrade to a fab lake view room. We have been many times before each time gets better. Room staff and food all amazing.we are gong back at Xmas for our 4th party night with family always guaranteed a great night ! We took our little dog this time and she was very well catered for with a lovely comfy bed and blanket and food bowls.thanks to you all at lodore. See you soon. 
4; My husband and I recently stayed in one of the suites at the hotel. We made staff aware of our disappointment with regards to overall room condition on departure. How lovely to receive a email from hotel management explaining the room has had a full refurbishment and also inviting my husband and I back for a night over Xmas complimentary.. just goes to show the quality of the staff and how hard they work. We look forward to our return.. many thanks 
4; The hotel itself was extremely clean and well presented, and my room was spacious and inviting. The staff I spoke to were very knowledgeable and I immediately felt comfortable. Being so close to Heathrow, I expected to hear quite a bit of noise but I heard nothing from outside the hotel or even from the other rooms or the corridors.  I certainly would stay here again! 
4;brilliant family holiday can't wait to visit again stayed for a week although the weather wasn't kind to us there was always plenty as a family for us all to do The water park is brill food is ok reasonable all in all an enjoyable stay
4; What a wonderful hotel! Just a stones throw away from the train station so it wasn't hard to find at all. The staff on reception were incredibly helpful and went out of their way to print off directions to a local attraction we wanted to go to, they also went out of their way to see if there were any rooms available so we could check in early.  Our room was fantastic, amazing view from the 16th floor, big light and airy room with lots of mirrors and lighting so no fighting for the best one whilst you get ready. Bathroom was spotless and had cute little Elemis Spa treats for us. The bed was soo comfy and there was a big TV and large wardrobe.  Breakfast was incredible so much choice and still lots of healthy options if you're in a diet.  Highly recommended and would definitely stay here again! 
4;Well located with lovely view on the Thames, London Bridge and the marina at the back. Easy access to the underground. Pretty quiet. Spacious rooms, clean and quiet. Would go back again anytime. Friendly staff happy to help anytime.
4;Lovely stay as part of Hallowhedon 6. Kids went to the convention and I used it as a base to spend the time in London. Nice room. Big beds. Excellent service throughout the hotel from check in to check out and lots of extras for a reasonable room rate.
4; A thoroughly enjoyable stay. Staff were courteous and helpful and location excellent for beach, pier, minature railway and shops. Our room was spacious and comfortable with air conditioning and a balcony with sea view. The selection for breakfast was amazing which more than catered for all15 of our family's extensive taste. At breakfast Chef and Ron our waiter were very helpful. The decor and view from the dining room was beautiful. The indoor pool enabled our children and grandchildren to spend time relaxing together. Facilities for parking were excellent with easy access to the hotel reception. 
4; Could a hotel feel anymore like home?!   These suites are absolute stunning. My partner and I stayed in a standard studio suite which was more spacious than I had imagined and nicer than their pictures give credit for.   The room was cosy and the bed was possibly the most comfortable bed I have slept in a UK hotel!   Having a kitchen area was perfect as we did not make it for the complimentary breakfast - signs of an amazing NYE night.   The staff were very helpful, friendly and willing.   In terms of location, this hotel is on the door step of The Bullring and central to everything you could possibly need. I saw that other reviewers stated it was difficult to find.....I'm not sure what's difficult to find when there is big enough sign and glass windows with 'Staybridge Suites' attached to it?!   All in all, we will coming back here every time we visit Birmingham! 
4;Beautiful hotel with lots of character and charm.. Great family room with extra bedroom. Attentive and helpful staff. Tasty breakfast. Great location with parking making visiting Blenheim Palace so easy. We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay.
4;Lovely welcome from staff and this was preceded by a phone call wishing me a happy birthday. Room sea facing with two double beds which were very comfortable. Bathroom spacious but rusty towel rail. Breakfast ample and varied and great to sit and look at the sea while eating. All staff friendly and helpful. Thank you for my lovely birthday card and chocolates and stick of Brighton Rock it was a lovely surprise. Thank you Nadir for looking after our cases and taking our photo by the tree. Thank you all for a lovely stay
4; Great value. Great location walkable to attractions, yet away from the hustle and bustle. Staff attentive and services top notch. We stayed here for a five day visit to London. Subway from Heathrow was a block away. Rooms on the small side, but efficient and well designed.  
4; When we arrived to check in the receptionist saw my husband had a walking stick and immediately changed our room to a ground floor one. The room was really good and very clean. The staff are all very helpful ringing for taxis etc.Will definitely stay here again when visiting the area. 
4; Stayed at the apartments for 1 night on 12th Jan 2015. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive, I received a complimentary upgrade to an apartment. The apartment was spotlessly clean and well decorated, it was definitely more than I required however it was a welcome bonus and I'm not complaining. Excellent gym, pool and sauna/steam room facilities, I just chose the wrong time to visit as it was very busy. To have an on-site shopping mall was fantastic, and offered plenty of choice as an alternative to eating in the restaurant or bar. I didn't use the bar or restaurant facilities but I'm confident they would provide a high standard of service. Sadly the weather was terrible therefore I didn't use the garden area of the complex. I will definitely use this hotel again and would definitely recommend it as a place to stay when in the city. 
4; Just recently stayed there for one night celebrating an anniversary. Seen all the previous complaints about rooms, have to say that we got a complementary upgrade to a beautiful spacious room I could not fault. And as you can read in previous reviews staff is truly amazing!  Martino( apologies if misspelled) has been great at check in, I always say hospitality is something you cannot teach you either got it or not. He does for sure. Recommend!! 
4; We arrived in the afternoon and were shown to the lift and given directions to the room. We got to the room which was lovely and within a few minutes the phone rang. It was a much appreciated courtesy call from reception asking if everything was ok and offering a free glass of Pimm's for the jubilee. The man from reception kindly brought the drinks up. When he came into the room he offered us a room change because the tv was at an odd angle which made it difficult to see. We accepted this gratefully. Once in the new room the tv wouldn't work so we were then offered another room which had a kingsize bed (we had only paid for double) and we were also given free Internet and movies for our stay as an apology, but this was given to us without us even complaining. This was a really refreshing experience and nothing was too much for the staff who really went out of their way to make our sty enjoyable, even offering advice on what to do in the city. The bed and pillows were really comfortable and the decor was lovely. I would definitely recommend the hotel to others. 
4; Brilliant, great value for money. We found it clean and very well placed for Central London. Breakfast was very good but the coffee wasn't great! If you want to share a bottle of wine with friends it's very good value.    
4; We stayed at this hotel for our Ladies golf break and it was fantastic.The staff were so friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were perfect. The restaurant is lovely and the food excellent. The Leisure club is perfect with the bowling an added extra.  The course is challenging and would definitely recommend buggies for the less fit golfer. Beautiful scenery. 
4; We stayed at Matfen Hall 21st/22nd March together with many friends and family to celebrate our Daughter's marriage. The weekend was just perfect in every way, the Great Hall being magnificent for the Wedding Ceremony and the superb building and grounds provided an extra special magical atmosphere. The food and accommodation were excellent and we could not fault the fantastic facilities. The staff were all so helpful and kind, we could not have wished for better service. All in all thank you so much to everyone at Matfen Hall for making Kate and Nick's day one to remember. Jane Paskins 
4; our room was lovely, we had a fireplace in it and lovely large windows to let in light, but also very good blackout curtains to make it easier to lie in in the morning.  The bathroom was very spacious and the shower was really great.  Only slight negative was a very slow TV connection, but other than that no complaints. The staff were pleasant and professional.  We personally did not go for the breakfast option, because at the pre-authorisation at the desk when we arrived we were told it was £20 per person for breakfast, which we felt was quite excessive! Luckily we found a really good and considerably cheaper cafe nearby to go to instead. 
4;Really enjoyed my weekend at Forest Mere. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and always happy to help. I enjoyed being able to do lots of swimming in the lovely pool and the aqua classes were fun to attend. Also loved the nutritious and healthy foods and have now got back into more healthy eating.  Looking forward to booking another traditional week at Springs (only becuase its closer to me) which I did last year loved.
4; Just had an overnight stay with hubby and loved it. Lovely location - quiet but great access to lots nearby, staff at reception were really helpful and the pool etc was fab. Wish we'd had longer but will definitely return. 
4; We only stayed one night but wished it was more. Excellent view from our windows room 333. Breakfast was lovely but i was one of the first in as an early riser. The chef was kind and approachable, as were all the staff i came across. My husband wants to live here he liked it that much! For future guests the cost for parking is £12 . 
4; I wasn't sure about this hotel beforehand as some of the reviews seemed to suggest it was expensive but I can truthfully say that I was really surprised with what a great hotel it is. The service at the front desk is exceptional and they make you feel welcome from the moment you walk through the door. I got a really good dinner bed and breakfast rate which was more than worth the money. Great food and the bar had a nice feel to it. We went to the pool which was also really nice with a lovely steam and sauna. I can't fault the hotel and would definitely go back without hesitation. 
4; Arrived Saturday 23rd may for an engagement party , very nice welcome from reception staff , lovely modern hotel , room was very comfortable and clean and lovely breakfast too , would definatly stay here again , 
4;This is our second visit and on both occasions we have had superb service  this year we dined with friends in the hotel restaurant and wished we had done it last year instead of being ripped off at fancy so called celebrity restaurants. The food for a set menu was good value, tasty and well presented
4; I have very good friends in Bournemouth and took the opportunity to have a mid-week break to visit them in the evenings and spend the days enjoying what Bournemouth has to offer. I spent ages looking for a hotel and wanted something really nice that wouldn't break my bank account.   I'm normally a budget hotel chain person (not naming names!) But I came across The Orchid Hotel and was amazed at how reasonable it was. In fact, it came out cheaper than the hotel chain I stayed in on my last visit.   The Orchid Hotel is a gorgeous place to be. The staff were so kind and thoughtful (being greeted by a lady in the hallway whilst I checked out the leaflet stand with a 'Hi, Miss Newbery' blew me away). The breakfast each morning was delicious and the lovely lady who served me each time couldn't do enough for me. This was the first trip alone in a while so I felt slightly awkward about dining on my own, but the atmosphere of the dining room really helped. Eating breakfast whilst listening to Michael Buble was nice!  I stayed in the superior king room and it was to die for. I had so much room, it was so quiet and the facilities were more than enough for me. I would have been chuffed with a room half the size. The hotel was about 5-10 minutes walk from the pier, so I was able to leave my car at the hotel whilst I went exploring.  I intend to stay here every time I head to Bournemouth because for me, The Orchid Hotel is perfection. I can't thank them enough for helping me have the break I seriously needed! 
4; Great stay. Fun friendly staff. Got lots of info on where to go from the receptionist. An it wasnt to much trouble for her. Although there were a lot of people checking in. Very helpful an well presented. 
4; My visit to Champneys was an unexpected treat from a friend... it was the most perfect treat I have ever received all thought I didn't know what to expect My first impression of Champneys as we approached was the serene abeyance of the grounds and the tranquility and peace. We were greeted at the reception by friendly staff who made us feel right at home in this magnificent building. The decor and furnishings are well preserved and of traditional period We were escorted to a comfortable relaxed room to complete and check personal details. We were offered light refreshments that were easily available on the buffet table in the room. Staff were always on hand yet never intruded on our privacy, We enjoyed a relaxing breakfast and lunch in the restaurant which held a good selection of choices for the occasion the atmosphere was cool and calm the restraint is clean and spacious with option of eating out on the lawned patio which has a variety of optional casual seating choices   I used some of the treatments which made me feel fantastic nothing was to much trouble for any of the staff, They all made me feel like a princess and that I was special I'd forgotten how it felt to be so relaxed, We swam in the well lite pool, relaxed in the Jacuzzi, chilled out on the sun loungers on the grass along the river bank, just listening to the birds in the trees, we walked around the grounds following the well sign posted snow drop walk ...to name but a few Champneys has so much more to offer but all to soon it was time to leave l didn't want to go home I was sad to leave BUT will be returning A S A P Thankyou for making my stay so comfortable and stress free there is not another place on this earth I'd rather be. After my experience I felt I could rejoin the rat race Champneys has a calm and relaxing atmosphere the staff are calm which makes a calm place for me to be... I recommend this special piece of England to everyone... IN A NUT SHELLl.... (1) RELAX ..... tranquility and peace.. (2) REJUVENATE... rebuild mind and spirit.... (3) REJOIN... ready for anything............ 
4;We visited the St Michael Hotel and Spa for our anniversary and were bowled over by the service from the minute we walked in the door. We were welcomed by the friendly receptionist and given an early check into our gorgeous room with sea view balcony. The spa facilities were lovely and not too busy so were able to enjoy the swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi comfortably. We decided to go down for cocktails before dinner and were served by Will who made us really welcome, brought our drinks to the table, brought the dinner menus and then a glass of champagne as he had heard it was our anniversary. Will and our gorgeous waitress Laurie looked after us amazingly well and made the evening very special for us. Our room was spacious, beautifully decorated and the bed was huge and very comfortable. 11 out of 10 to the St Michaels Hotel and Spa! We will be back!!
4; Absolutely love this hotel it was worth every penny, staff were very friendly and polite, very clean, rooms are huge and have fantastic views of the docks and out to sea, not too far from the city either, we will definitely be visiting again!! 
4; Stayed here with my sister. We were surprised and delighted by our lovely room which was in the annexe. The room was large and modern with a sofa next to a picture window. The bathroom was good with a fabulous shower and nice fluffy towels. Breakfast was very enjoyable with plenty of choice, and dinner in Signatures restaurant was also good, but not much choice (from set menu) if you ate there for more than one night. However, that was our choice, there are loads of restaurants within a short walk from the hotel. The staff, without exception, were friendly, cheerful and helpful and the owners should be pleased and grateful to have such good employees. I have already recommended this hotel to friends and family and advise people to check the hotel website as there are some very good deals to be had. 
4; Hotel is in the perfect location..lots of theatre's nearby as well as pubs and places to eat... highly recommend this hotel. Staff are friendly and willing to help with anything. We will be going back in the near future. Brilliant hotel overall. 
4; Lovely warm welcome, super room amenities, so fabulous to see the Nadler team again and some new faces that have joined. Room was spacious, well lit and quiet with big windows and lots of natural light. Great service once again with dealing with booking restaurants, laundry and meeting room requests. Fabulous to see how the area keeps growing and diversifying, it really is an amazingly central location! Many thanks once again. 
4; My husband and I stayed at this hotel back in February where we got a late last minute deal for Dinner, Bed & Breakfast on a Saturday night. The staff were friendly on arrival and checked us in to our room even though we were 3 hours earlier than the check in time stipulated. Our room was lovely - an executive room overlooking the back of the hotel - it was a fantastic room and really beautifully appointed. I am sure the rooms with views are just delightful. We had our lunch in the lounge and the service from the staff was just brilliant. Similarly our experience in the restaurant in the evening was equally as good where we were served excellent food by a very experienced and attentive member of staff( I think he was management). Yes the food is pricey unless you book dinner within the room rate and drinks are pricey BUT having said that locations like this with such great staff do speak for themselves.   We have stayed at several locations within the Hand Picked chain ( Rookery Hall & New Hall Spa which is truly exceptional) and cannot really say we have ever had any complaints - each hotel offers that special uniquness and you do find yourself comparing the best of each.  I have read some of the other reviews which were not so favourable and I must say I am surprised the manager of the hotel has not responded to these himself, because other 'Hand Picked' Managers do - good bad or indifferent.  I would certainly return to Wood Hall - but we have another 14 locations to work through first! 
4; we stayed overnight at this premier inn evesham. its really well positioned to visit some of the villages in the cotswolds, we stayed to break up the journey on our way to devon. you can barely hear any road noise from the main road and the bed was one of the comfiest beds we have ever slept in a hotel. really friendly staff and the room and bathroom were spotless. it was our 1st ever stay in a premier inn and will definately stay again. well worth the money. 
4; We had a wonderful stay again at Saunton Sands this is our 4th year there and we will return next year. We have four children from 10yrs to 4yrs who love everything about it from the breakfast to evening entertainment and they especially love the playroom and Antonia who runs it she is truly amazing . The food is fantastic and the service is warm and friendly . We would highly recommend it to any family with children . This year we had a family reunion and it was perfect. 
4; we stayed there only for 1 night but I had the feeling that the hotel was great. atmosphere, staff, cleanliness, room was comfortable, bathroom great.. we had all what we need. the staff most of all is really helpful and nice. I would absolutely go back for one more night. 
4; My husband and I only stayed one night but wished our stay was longer. The bed was very comfortable, top quality pillows and duvet. Our evening meal was excellent too. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Will definitely visit again. 
4; We had the most amazing night away at Oakley Hall Hotel. Despite it being built in the 1800s, it's super modern. The grounds are beautiful. We did their woodland trek and saw everything. It's only about 2 miles. The suite we stayed in was stunning, a super king size bed which was so comfortable! The food was exquisite! Seriously mouthwatering good. We had the afternoon tea, a three course dinner in the evening and breakfast the following morning. And finally, the staff were so friendly and attentive. I'd go back in a heartbeat! 
4; We got married here in September 2013 and had the most amazing time.   The event manager was very accommodating and fulfilled all our requirements with the upmost care and attention throughout the whole planning process. The staff on the day were fantastic and the service was second to non.   The hotel is a gorgeous place, it has had an amazing transformation after the many refurbishments it has made over the months before the wedding. Most of the rooms were gorgeous and very comfortable (rooms 3 & 4 are snagging) however not all of the rooms have not been refurbished which is a disappointing factor. You will be welcomed by a gorgeous fireplace as you walk in the entrance hall, enjoy a lovely drink in the charismatic bar, have a wonderful meal in the historical Barons Hall with a menu that tickles any taste buds as our menu for our wedding breakfast was amazing. The gardens are beautiful to walk around and the rest of the house is fantastic to explore.   We were dissapointed during the evening as the power kept cutting out during our disco but I wasn't too bothered by then as we've had a wonderful day and we stayed the night before as well and it was a fantastic weekend. All of our guests commented on how lovely the place is and really enjoyed the food during the whole weekend. The rose champagne is wonderful and the mocktails were exactly what I wanted. The only other thing I would have liked is more time as I never managed to fit a game of croquet in!   Many thanks to the manager, Christian, event coordinator, Karin and the staff and the chef on the night for dealing with a difficult menu and all the other requirements we had, we enjoyed every minute of our wedding and weekend stay. 
4; We can't rate this place enough! We had a a amazing wedding here on 25th July and would recommend Lumley castle to anyone! The service was fantastic and we both felt like king and queen the whole day! 
4; The Hotel is in an excellent position for exploring the Cornish Coast We stayed in the Lodge, it was spacious, clean, comfortable and kitted out to a high standard  We appreciated being able to use the facilities at the Hotel even though we were self catering in the Lodge The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful (especially the restaurant staff). The food was lovely and the views from the restaurant were stunning We had a wonderful time and would definitely go back to The Longcross 
4; So far have been to two tribute nights here,what can I say Al -a -carte 3 course meal,great entertainment all for £28.service excellent ,atmosphere friendly.If you want the full package for a great price look out on their website for their tribute and other entertainment nights. 
4; Wonderful hotel, the room was was lovely and comfortable. I was there over night for a conference the next day. I'd like to return so time with my husband for a week end. I didn't use the spa or the restaurant for dinner. Breakfast was excellent lots of choice. 
4;Wow what a wonderful experience. We visited for a suprise present for my partners 40th ( not that we told anybody that). A super yacht so clean and gleaming. We checked in without and problems. We had a meal in the restaurant which was beautiful our waiter Brian was very attentive very polite. Our room was sparkling clean and very comfortable. The staff were wonderful and couldn't be more courteous and polite. Breakfast was buffet style and included everything you could want and gain was very nice. On check out Vadim was very helpful and very polite.  Great location. Great hotel. Amazing time and win definitely be returning.
4;We made the fantastic decision to have our wedding weekend here and we had the most magical and amazing wedding. The location was so beautiful and romantic, the food at the pre-wedding dinner and the wedding breakfast was fantastic and cannot be faulted, the staff were so friendly and lovely it was like being amongst family. Pauline was our wedding co-ordinator and so much more. She was so kind, friendly and made it so personal to us and nothing was a problem. In the evening the location became even more beautiful and stunning and was such an amazing place for our wedding photos. The accommodation and bridal suite was fantastic, luxurious and definitely 5 star with views that were breathtaking particularly with the late winter as the trees were full of different New England colours. We have left with memories and an amazing and magical experience that we will never forget.
4; This is a lovely hotel with walking distance to Fleet centre. Clean comfy rooms and friendly staff. Very nice breakfasts all you could ask for. We had breakfast in the dining room one morning and in the conservatory the next both lovely 
4;Had another great stay at the sph. We stay here 3/4 times a year for weekend breaks. We always book direct with hotel as their prices are always as good if not better than any other sites! All the staff were as lovely as always and as always really helpful. Looking forward to our next visit at xmas.
4; I can't fault anything on my recent trip for afternoon tea with my family - the whole experience was perfect. I am a blue badge holder and the day before my visit, I contacted the hotel to find out about parking near the hotel. The staff were so helpful and Roberta in the restaurant took the time to help me which I was very grateful for. On arrival at the hotel, the staff were so friendly and welcoming, and the room was warm and relaxing. We were all made a fuss of, especially my two children who were very spoilt and nothing was too much trouble. The food kept coming and everything was delicious as the staff catered to everyone's dietary needs. The children, along with their special non alcoholic cocktails and hot chocolate were presented with an array of sandwiches which also included popular kids fillings as well as the more grown up options so they could try the more adventurous sandwiches should they wish and the tartlets and yorkshires were a hit. Everything was so fresh, the scones were warm and everything melted in the mouth. The staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for us and it was nice to see the head chef out of the kitchen chatting to guests and supporting his team. It was a lovely experience for everyone and we would definitely recommend it and hopefully return soon. 
4; I love Swinton Park - we got married here and like to return when we can. The staff are very friendly and helpful - the porter who welcomed us (and parked our car) even remembered us from before (over a year ago). Our room had spectacular views and was beautiful, clean and with the most comfortable bed we have slept in that isn't our own. We booked a baby sitter through the hotel (CRB checked) and went to the restaurant for the first evening. We had the taster menu - fantastic - about 10 small courses giving a wonderful selection of flavours and textures. It was all very good but we both thought the Quail was exceptional. Lovely breakfast - good choice of cooked breakfast dishes as well as a selection of cold meats and cheese, cereals, yogurt, fruit, pastries and even bloody Marys. The spa was clean and well stocked with fresh towels, robes and toiletries. Room service the second night with our little one - again excellent food. The grounds are beautiful, quiet and relaxing with loads of room for the little one to run around. Lots of wildlife to see and a bird of prey centre. Perfect - can't wait to go again 
4; staff very welcoming and helpful. smart appearence and very obliging with our 2 young children i.e carry buggy up the stairs and lettin us store our milk in there fride which was for children. would definately stay here again and recommend to people with or without children. 
4; As soon as we arrived the staff at the hotel were so welcoming and helpful, something which continued throughout our stay. We were offered full use of the facilities for the remainder of the day when we checked out, one example of the fantastic service offered. The hotel grounds and setting are stunning, beautiful, quiet and relaxing. Our room was modern and very comfortable and clean, the spa bath adding a touch of luxury. Breakfast was lovely with plenty of options available. We used the spa facilities which were superb. There were children in the pool, however the hotel does have designated 'adult only' times if you prefer to go when it's quieter. The hotel is located 5 minutes out of Ambleside and is in an excellent position for exploring the lakes. We will definitely return. 
4;we enjoyed our stay. The hotel was very clean and well presented. The staff were friendly and polite. We would not hesitate to return to this hotel range again if we were in the area. Parking is limited but do not be put off parking permits for the street are issued by the hotel.
4; Loved it, had a very relaxed evening with my mum during our two day trip to London. Very modern, very clean, great room, hotel staff very helpful. The pool is small but managed to have a swim before it got busy. We liked the location, quieter than most, our room overlooked the train line but we didn't hear it and slept well. It was perfect for our visit to Buckingham palace and Victoria theatre, Would definitely stay here again. 
4; Just returned from a 2 night break at this relatively small hotel. From when I spoke to Julie, who was very helpful, to make booking, (Living Social Voucher) through to check out, I do not have any negative feedback.  We stayed with our dog, which was no trouble, they obviously allocate people with dogs to ground floor rooms, by fire exit straight out onto grounds which makes life so much easier!  It was no trouble taking the wonderful breakfast in bar area so we could have dog with us rather than leave him in the room, the food overall was really good, although choice a little limited. We didn't choose to eat in restaurant, which looked nice, bit pricey.  The staff were really friendly, some young lads in bar / waiting, don't remember all the names but Marcus stood out as being exceptionally polite.   Generally a lovely stay, highly recommended, thank you all. 
4; The Cranleigh was half an hour's walk from Windermere station on a lovley day it's a nice walk. We arrived after having breakfast in the villege and had a walk around. We were welcomed at the Cranleigh with a smile and then we were shown to our room which was lovely and very comfortable. I bought a deal with livingsocial which included the the room for two nights, we also received complementary champagne. rose pettles and chocolates. This made our stay very special We enjoyed breakfast and there was a good choice of food from the menu. I would reccomend this guesthouse to couples. It is very romantice and everything was thought of even down to dvds being available. There was a cruise which we went on to Ambleside which even though it rained was very good and full of information about Lake Windermere. 
4; I stayed here last January and i really could not have been more impressed. Although the car parking could be seen as a little pricey it was nothing when teamed with the service and quality of room we received.   I booked a top floor room, right on the end of the building as we stayed for a special occasion. Unfortunately i had a chest infection and so cheekily rang the hotel to see if it would be possible to have an extra pillow.   We made it to the top (8 floors i think?) and when we got in to our room our jaws dropped, the all the way round half the room large were large windows to look out upon Manchester, was so interesting. The bed was huge and the hotel had provided us with three pillows each and two softer ones in the wardrobe. The bathroom was lovely, huge double walk-in shower and big bath, it was a nice touch that the television played in to the bathroom, was fun to have music on as we got ready.   I couldn't get the hair dryer to work (my boyfriend later pointed out i was actually using it wrong - embarrassing) so i rang the hotel reception and within a couple of minutes there was a knock at the door and i was brought a new hair dryer. So impressed.   The spa was also lovely, i felt so pampered and relaxed and the facilities are unusual and brilliant.   We ventured out in to Manchester for a meal and found an Indian to eat at - i wish i had the name because it was delicious and returned to the hotel bar for drinks.   I can honestly say despite having a really bad chest i had the best sleep of my life! I was propped up and surrounded by pillows, i felt so refreshed in the morning, even if getting out of bed was hard.   Something a little strange perhaps? I mentioned to boyfriend a few weeks later that whilst we had been at the hotel i had dreamt that people had come in to the room whilst we were sleeping, to which he replied, 'so did i'. We both matched up that what felt like early morning we had been roused by someone opening our door speaking and quickly closing it, as i was poorly and hungover i had assumed it was a dream but seems odd that we both matched up entirely?  Either way it would be a pleasure to stay at this hotel again, i can't commend it enough. 
4; Wonderful hotel. Excellent cotton bedding,together with extremely comfortable bed made for a very good nights sleep. Spacious room(twin on third floor)although at the rear,so no sea view it did ensure a peaceful night. The breakfast was without doubt,second to none. Well cooked,and hot. The staff were all very friendly and polite,nothing was too much trouble. 
4; My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights 13/14 February 15 for Valentines. We were very impressed. Everything is pristine white. The rooms are a lovely size. The breakfast was very nice. We would highly recommend this hotel. location - Eastend was a little walk to the tube. 10 minutes. If you wanted to visit Covent Garden and Leicester Square, again we would highly recommend a visit. They are 2 lovely places. 
4; We held our wedding reception here in Nov 2010 - fantstic service by Kay.   Superior rooms all lovely - highly recommend the upgrade to exec room and if poss one of the penthouse rooms.  Hotel extremely helpful and could not do enough for us. Definately stay again.  We would also recommend: - DJ provided by hotel - Chair covers and table decor - Seats and treats - Chocolate Lips (chocolate fountain) - Cake Magic, Bromsgrove based, (Wedding Cake) 
4;Lovely hotel, very welcoming, comfortable, beautifully clean, super food. The outstanding factor was the staff who catered for all our needs and more besides. Nothing was too much trouble, whatever we asked for was there as soon as we had asked for it - and always, always, always with a smile. They moved literally mountains to make sure a huge and important conference went swimmingly well. First class, highly recommended.
4; Stayed for only 1 night on a business trip but wish I'd stayed for longer. The individual nature of this hotel really stands out with it's attention to detail and really helpful staff. The Chinese icecream whilst checking in was very welcome. Very comfortable bed and pillows, supersize towels and even proper Cushelle toilet rolls. Good shower and enough light in the bathroom to do my makeup. A big thank you must go to Jana - Hotel Manager for making my first stay so memorable. I will be recommending this to all our travellers to our Ealing office. Will also come back for a private stay whilst in London, as great connections to Paddington. Chinese Dim Sum restaruant is also a must whilst you visit - try the steamed custard buns - you will not be disappointed! Lara A, Hampshire 
4; We stayed here as it worked out the cheapest/best value hotel with breakfast but I'm really glad we did. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads station, and 12mins from the Harbourside area or 15mins walk from Cabot Circus. very good location.   We were able to leave our luggage with the hotel before check in and after check out, which was a great help.   The breakfast choices were great, even for a vegetarian like me! Vegetarian sausages can be ordered. The only complaint was that the scrambled egg was like mush!  We didn't use the leisure facilities so I cannot comment on those. The room itself was spacious, clean and comfortable. There is a mini bar in room with 4 bottles of water, but it can be used for storing your own drinks too. 
4; We got married at the hotel on Sunday and what can I say other than pure excellence from start to finish! we really could not have wished for anything more (apart from better weather!). We have spent a lot of time with the owners and their family at the hotel whilst planning our wedding and have found that they are really lovely, helpful, genuine people, nothing is to much trouble. Anthony, Scott, Sandi, John, Jake, Danielle and all the staff thankyou so so much.   The hotel is stunning and we knew from the moment we drove into the beautiful grounds that this was our dream wedding venue. We wanted something that was a cut above the rest and this is what we got with the Saddleworth. The Ballroom where our wedding reception was held is just THE most beautiful room I have ever seen with every detail finished to the highest standard. We had looked at several other wedding venues, none of which came close to The Saddleworth Hotel. We booked all the hotel rooms for our family and friends, each room is unique and has its own amazing style and comfort. The beautiful firework display at the end of the evening was just the icing on the cake, thankyou again.  We are looking forward to returning to the hotel one day, perhaps on our first anniversary and remembering what a truly fantastic time we had.  I would definatley recommend this as an ideal wedding venue if your looking for something special as we were.  Bev, Brett and Alfie (the new Mr & Mrs Baxter!!) xxx 
4; We booked this hotel as part of the Legoland overnight package offered on the Legoland website. It was absolutely amazing from start to finish. After a day at Legoland Windsor we drove up the motorway approx 15mins to arrive at the hotel. The service was outstanding, we were given our key straight away and the kids were given a goody bag each plus cookies and milk at the bar. Our room was immaculate and as soon as we had got to the room we had a telephone call from Reception to make sure the beds were made up correctly for the kids. There were chocolate bars left on our pillows, lots of clean, fresh towels for us and the room was spotless. The main restaurant service was faultless for both dinner and breakfast and the staff were so friendly. Everything was clean and tidy and stocked up. Very impressed indeed with this hotel - would strongly recommend to any family. Our kids were 7yrs and 3yrs and the staff couldn't do enough for us. Would definitely go back again. 
4;I recently came to stay with my husband at The Dales and we were very pleased with the relaxing settings. I don't feel that some of the negative comments are fair at all. The place has a lovely garden, not far from the sea or Sheringham Park so it's perfect for a lovely evening stroll.  We were very impressed with the high quality of food. But what really stood out for us was the excellent service from the staff, in particular was Lucy. She was very helpful and attentive it's a shame more establishments don't have quality staff like her! She is an asset to the Mackenzie hotels! Although it was reasonably busy we never felt ignored.   We will certainaly be back to stay!
4;" Booked this on line, birthday treat, booked a suite 227 which had an enormous bed and a tv at the bottom of the bed, a bathroom that was bigger than my house and Molton Brown toiletries,just fantastic. When we arrived, there were road works so we missed the sign but a quick call rectified this and we found it and our first words were &quot;wow&quot;. Firstly the room was just fabulous++++++++++, with a brilliant view of the lake... The evening meal was ok, service ok, would recommend that they put on white linen tablecloths on to go with the linen napkins to add to the glamour. Breakfasts were ok, service ok, but room was out of this world..... Tried room service one night, absolutely dismal despite five phonecalls...but on checkout this was dealt with by management in a very professional way and I was satisfied with outcome, would definately recommend this place to stay and would go back again. Spa was nice, I wanted to swim but it wasn't a pool to swim in but still nice, the steam room was lovely. Wi fi not great but that didn't worry us. Ideally situated for exploring the Lakes, when can I go again.....???? "
4;" I stayed here for my anniversary and it was incredible. We were there on a Sunday night so noise wasn't an issue in our room (Room 16) which is just above the bar. On arrival we were told that the room was not yet ready so we happily popped along the village to have a cheeky cocktail or two. On our return our luggage was already in the room and we were given two vouchers for cocktails in the velvet bar! Amazing, we would have been happy with the room alone but this was just lovely. We were then shown our room and offered tea or coffee, which came with lovely biscuits and fresh milk. The room itself was stunning and the bed was incredible. The staff did everything possible to be of assistance and I cannot sing their praises more! From the instant we arrived they were friendly and helpful. Due to this, we decided to dine in the velvet restaurant which I had previously eaten at before and was not disappointed at my second visit. The food was delicious, the house wine was lovely, too! We then popped upstairs to the bar which was the perfect place to relax before heading up to our room. The cocktails packed a punch and I cannot complain about the hotel at all! We are planning to return to the hotel again in August but are tempted to treat ourselves to a balcony room and I cannot wait!!    I will happily recommend Velvet to anyone I know, and having stayed at Great John Street Hotel (Another popular Manchester hotel) I am happy to report that Velvet overtakes them in all aspects of service, the staff are friendlier, the hotel more upto scratch and the beds much much bigger ;)  Thank you, Velvet! Will be back shortly, hopefully! "
4; thank you for a very enjoyable two days , we were celebrating my husbands 80th birthday and we certainly chose the right place to stay. Everything was perfect, the room comfortable, the breakfast excellent and the wonderful surprise came with a cake delivered to the room. We will certainly return to this hotel when we have something else to celebrate . 
4; Excellent stay - no complaints at all- good location - large rooms - jacuzzi a treat ! 2 Cocktails for £10 topped it all off well ! Car park directly under the hotel at £15 a night also completed the package - will be back to stay ! 
4;We would just like to thank the amazing staff, in particular Jonathan our wedding coordinator, for making our wedding day run so smoothly. They were incredibly organised, food was fantastic and the location is out of this world. We had an amazing day despite the drizzle!  We would highly recommend this venue.  Mr and Mrs Sefton x
4;I reserved a table for lunch at the Oak Panelled Restaurant at the George having heard a lot of positive reviews from friends and colleagues in the area. The ambience of the restaurant was second to none- it brought me back to the days as a student barrister where dining at the Inns of Court were an elaborate affair. The waiters were very attentive. There was a party going on but my food came very quickly. I ordered the Woodbridge duck which was beautifully done. Dessert was a real treat as a three tier dessert trolley is wheeled to you with artistics sweet treats which would tempt even anyone without a sweet tooth. I went for the lemon and ginger cheesecake, served with raspberry coulis which was absolutely perfect. Would definitely recommend the walk-in lunch menu (Mondays to Saturdays only) and cannot wait to visit again.
4;This is the second time we have stayed in the hot tub suite and it didn't disappoint. Everything was just perfect from the luxurious room to the beautiful food in the Cocina restaurant. The staff are attentive and extremely helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. We shall be returning.
4; Once again a fantastic stay at this hotel . Was upgraded to Club room on fourth floor . Staff all very helpful and pleasant .Breakfast room had been re done up since last visit and breakfast was good plenty to eat .The room was clean and tidy no bad comments for this hotel. Easy ride on the tubes to any part of London. 
4; We stayed for one night as a birthday treat, it was perfect. Nice jacuzzi bath and great view of the harbour. The food was excellent and the bar is a really nice chilled atmosphere. It's just a fantastic place to stay! 
4; Just returned from a 3 day winter break at Harbour Heights. Excellent value for money, included room with harbour view, dinner on first night and champagne afternoon tea second day. Food was wonderful, so much so that we booked dinner on our third evening. Staff were very friendly, especially reception. Restaurant staff were very obliging and nothing was too much trouble. Views were superb, and we experienced storm Imogen! Rooms very comfortable and standard of the hotel was excellent. We will definitely use hotel again. Only negative comment is the layout of final bill, could be laid out better to make it clearer on additional spending. 
4; Attended a wedding here last June. Was lovely. Food was fantastic, hotel room was spotlous and the breakfast the following money was very tasty. Bar was a little over priced during the evening of the wedding. However We hope to return for another night and massage soon. Thanks x 
4;" we had such a pleasant experience at the Ettington Park Hotel! very kind and well mannered waiters with great sense of humour and no &quot;overdoing&quot;! the food served was as described in the menu-all fresh and tasty, served nicely! As we came on a weekend, there were plenty other visitors too, which only made the atmosphere more enjoyable and festive! So i would like to say a huge thank you to the management team and workers on the day, we had a wonderful time! "
4; Quick check in and comfortable and well looked after. The staff were very nice and wanted to please us even though we were there just one night.  The food was lovely and the rooms were clean. Prices here were also reasonable and overall, we had a good experience. 
4; Very professional staff. Hotel very clean and a very comfortable room. Food was excellent, facilities excellent. We have nothing but praise for this hotel and the staff that help to run it. Tram connections to the city if you wish to leave your car behind. Ideal for the Motor Sport Arena. 
4; Stayed at this hotel for one night for my partners birthday, it is without a doubt a beautiful hotel, not modern but the setting is wonderful. Plenty variety on the bar and dinner menu (dinner is amazing). The rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet. Reception staff are very friendly, bar staff were a little less inviting which made us go out for lunch rather than dine in during the day, brilliantly located right next to Covent Garden station and you can walk to any part of London you wish. I hope I have the name correct of the door man Jason, he is an asset to the hotel. 
4; We arrived at the Grand, being greeted by a lonesome bagpiper - it was for a wedding party just arriving. First impressions were that it was a very elegant hotel. Although it was very large, we did not hear other people once in our room. Room was very nice - had seating area and a little hallway as well. Bed was comfortable. Swimming pool and gym was small, but in beautiful surroundings. .breakfast was good - lots of choices for healthy eating and cooked breakfast. Also pastries and home baked croissants! Staff were always very friendly and helpful. Overall it was a lovely stay. The ethos and history of the building were enchanting! Would strongly recommend it. 
4; We came on an intentional shopping spree to westfield shopping centre. We were unsure about the hotel because but it was absolutely fine, easy to find, parking at the bingo behind for cheap price, 10 minute walk to shopping centre. Very modern hotel, rooms weren't very big but perfect for what we needed considering we weren't spending any time at the hotel. Breakfast was a shambles, staff looked stressed and confused as i was very busy. Lots of stuff running out and not being replenished, coffee machine stopped working. But the gentleman at the bar kindle made us coffees. Also used the gym in the morning which isn't state of the art but definitely does the job. Would definitely go back. 
4; Just returned from a wonderful time at Forest Mere. The Manager who was really helpful upgraded us as it was our 25th Anniversary. An amazing surprise and a fantastic Suite... Food really good and such lovely staff in restaurant and Champneys in general. A relaxing enjoyable couple of days. 
4; My husband and I have just had a fantastic weekend at Hotal La Tour. The rooms are lovely, well priced and very clean. We had dinner in the restaurant, which was fabulous and great value for money. We are returning in October to celebrate my husband's birthday with a large group of friends in the private dining area of the restaurant but think we might return before then. All the staff that we met just couldn't do enough for us, a great team of people. We are Brummies and think this hotel and the staff are a great advert for Birmingham and we should be shouting about this hotel. 
4; Went to minehead butlins on the 9th May mon- fri breakfast it was great Stayed in silver room had everything we needed bedside Made up tea coffee etc the Entertainment was very Good lots going on all day long had food included and That was lovely so much choice we are looking to go back in September . 
4; Had yet again a lovely time at butlins minehead stayed in silver room spotlessly clean food court dining great food great choice stayed at the Hilton many times breakfast better at butlins yes the painters were painting outside our chalet but a friendly bunch of guys very respectful to my old mum who I bring every year a happy place to be just bring back the beachcomber bar butlins!!!!!!!!! 
4;"Super amenities, with lots of lovely little touches: USB ports in the wall, Ipad to use in the room, espresso machine, complementary soft drinks, chocolate and other snacks in room. Comfy bed, lovely bedding, bath robes, great shower.   Friendly and professional staff, happy to help with anything and everything. We upgraded to access to the Amba Lounge and breakfast buffet on arrival. Really worth it, for £25 per night. The breakfast is great (another reviewer stated the coffee at breakfast quite thin - I have to agree, buts it's a minor point). We enjoyed the complementary drinks and snacks in the Amba lounge, which was a great place to rest in the middle of the day.  Our room overlooked a little alleyway. A busker (who was very good, but was performing with an amplifier with prerecorded beats) was rather loud one evening. Staff would have moved us to another room if available (but one wasn't), however they generously refunded a nights upgrade instead. Appreciated the gesture. The next night, no amplified busking, and the room was lovely and quiet.   We were visiting Londons Art Galleries; you can see the National Gallery from the hotel, and the hotel is 10 minutes walk to the Courtauld Gallery, 15 minutes to Royal Academy of Arts, so absolutely perfect location. (Also close to theatres, covent garden, great shopping, etc)  We will definitely return. Highly recommend."
4; Before we leave for our honeymoon we wanted to take the time to thank you all for giving us the most wonderful wedding day yesterday. From the very moment that we came into the hotel to look at the venue until the moment we left this morning the staff have always been welcoming and extremely helpful.   Our wedding day at the Quorn Country hotel went perfectly without a hitch from start to finish - it was exactly how we wanted it to be, thanks to Susan the wedding coordinator for doing a fantastic job. We must also make special mention of Matt, our master of ceremonies, who was amazing all day - nothing was too much trouble for him and he remained calm and professional the whole day.    All of our guests remarked on how lovely the day was and how nice the food and service was.   Thanks again for making our special day just that! 
4; From the moment I called the hotel to confirm, I was so impressed by how well Juris, Lucy, Paul, at reception were. Then the staff at the restaurant were absolutely brillnt! Let us not forget Max, the bar attender and his signature cocktails. Hotel du Vin Brighton: Thank-you :) 
4; We had to make some last minute changes to our booking. The hotel staff were very accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. Everything we asked for the staff were very prompt and attentive. The rooms were excellent even though the apartment was up six flights of stairs - it tested even the most fittest of our group. Perfect location only a short stroll to Kensington park 
4; Had a fantastic stay at The Sea Marge Hotel. The staff were brilliant and couldn't do enough for you, a credit to Mackenzie Hotels. The food was also lovely with lots to choose from. Even our fussy eater was satisfied :-) Rooms were spacious and comfy. A sea view is well worth the extra cost.   We will definitely return and will also be recommending the hotel to our friends.   Thank you Sea Marge 
4;" My husband and I booked a room in the Park Regis hotel ready for our visit to Birmingham where we had tickets to see a band at the Barclaycard Arena. Whilst looking for a hotel online we stumbled across this brand new hotel which was due to open 2 weeks before our visit so we got a very good price for the room. As with many hotels we have stayed in in the past where we just wanted a bed for the night, I wasn't particularly excited about the hotel, just the event we are attending. I certainly wasn't prepared for a hotel to leave such a imprint. Park Regis is by far one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Everything from the easily accessible setting to the greeting from the concierge, the beautiful interior and our gorgeous (brand new) double room. It was more than we ever expected.. The hotel became a big talking point throughout our stay which is something we rarely even notice when staying anywhere for such a short visit. We were greeted by the concierge, Grant, who welcomed us to the hotel and helped with our bags. He also directed us to the arena and also the shopping centre the morning after, all of which made our visit much easier, no wandering the streets on google maps. A very pleasant gentleman assisted us with our check-in and the hotel clerk was just as friendly. The main thing that caught our attention was the professionalism and smart appearence of all staff we came into contact with. At one point in the bar we watched as one of the staff members helped a lady off with her coat and pulled out her chair, something you rarely see these days and it definitely left an impression. I am sorry I didn't catch everyones names to give them more personal praise which they deserve. We will definitely be coming back to this hotel, we plan on coming for the hotel experience this time and soaking up everything Park Regis has to offer. We were told a cocktail bar is opening at the end of the month which sounds very exciting - we had a sneeky peek at the room so far and it looks incredible.. Thank you Park Regis for changing my view of hotels from &quot;just somewhere to sleep&quot; to a great experience. "
4; This hotel is beautiful, and very handy for all the tourist attractions. Big Ben, the London Eye and Buckingham Palace are literally a few minutes down the road, there's close access to St James Park tube station. The price of the food is a little on the ridiculous side, but there are restaurants close by if you want something cheaper. Nice room, comfortable beds and a spacious bathroom. Spent five nights there and enjoyed myself. 
4;My partner and I went for an evening meal after booking a table on the off chance and food was brilliant, excellent service, great wine, and lovely atmosphere! Will definitely be returning to try some more of the menu!
4;What a lovely welcome we had on arrival at the Metropolitan. Nothing was too much trouble for Steve, the Proprietor. The hotel was spotlessly clean throughout. The attention to detail was excellent. There were a selection of well presented toiletries - .well beyond what one normally expect. The room was well presented and had a good selection of teas, coffee and hot chocolate, biscuits and water. These were replenished daily which was unlike most hotels that only offer such a selection on the day of arrival. There was an excellent choice of foods at breakfast. The ingredients were of good quality and cooked freshly at a time chosen by the customers. I would have no hesitation in recommending this little gem of a hotel.
4; No.15 Great Pulteney really is a hidden gem. Behind the simple yet elegant exterior hides breathtaking decor, incredible food and some of the best service in Bath. After the most mouthwatering vegetarian meal, we partook in what could only be referred to as an exquisite cocktail experience. This unique, quirky, stunning hotel is a must-see for all. 
4; We were booked into another Hotel for a Romantic night away(only seconds away from the The Burlington, wouldn`t of let my dogs stay there!!!) Did a quick exit!! Beyond the BLACK CLOUD was a SUNNY HORIZON which was the BURLINGTON!! Thank goodness they were there! The Reception staff were wonderful, they went out of there way to make sure they accommodated us in every way possible!! The room was a delight, We had a meal in the restaurant which was excellent! REALLY LOVELY night, Breakfast was a perfect ending to a night away which nearly ended in DISASTER!! THANK YOU to all staff that RESCUED our night away!!! We'll certainly be staying again. THANK YOU !!!! 
4; We had our wedding at the Lismoyne on the 23rd June 2012 - all the staff were amazing they really couldnt do enough. The food was lovely and the whole day went very smoothly, from the moment we turned up at the hotel, i really cant thank the staff enough. Alot of our family and friends stayed the night at the hotel, and they all agreed that everything about the hotel was brilliant. If you are considering having a wedding reception or party here, then i would highly recommend it. Thanks again to all the staff for everything. Darren and Becky. 
4; We came to the hopping hare for my husbands birthday back in September and stayed over with breakfast the following morning. The whole experience was beyond fantastic. For our evening meal we both had a special of haddock and leek gratin, I can honestly say it was the best dish I‘ve ever tasted, it was delicious. My husband had blade of beef and I had chicken. Both were exceptional. I am not a personal fan of beef but my husband gave me a piece and I can honestly say I could easily be converted if beef always tasted that good. For desert we shared a chocolate brownie which again was to die for. To top off the amazing food it was complimented by a lovely ambience and atmosphere in the restaurant and our bedroom had the wow factor with a king size bed and all mod cons. The service through out was faultless and all the staff made sure we had a good evening.   Due to the fantastic experience we returned yesterday evening for a birthday dinner with the family for our mother in law. Second time round yet again - absolutely faultless. For starters we all differed with clams and chicken terrine. For mains we had duck, chicken risotto and pork belly. Deserts were the crème bruelee and ice cream with no complaints what so ever. The service was fantastic and the restaurant even kept aside a cake we brought in especially for the occasion. With being December I was apprehensive if the service would live up to the same expectations when we visited in September ,as Christmas times in restaurants can be a little chaotic! I can definitely say the experience last night matched our last visit and again I cant wait to return in the new year. I cant recommend this place enough. 
4; Wonderful facilities, great rooms and nice food, plenty of parking  Staff really helpful, nothing too much trouble. My hotel of choice when in the area for work. Gym and pool great. Reasonable pricing for the area. 
4; This hotel offers everything for those wanting to have a peaceful stay. The staff here are great, the food is good too and the bedrooms are a very good size with all modern facilities. Short distance from the financial district and close to central london. 
4; Fantastic hotel, absolutely ideal location for the museums. Easy to find from South Kensington tube station. Plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby, however, do consider eating in the hotel - real value-for-money table d'hote dinner menu. Good self-service breakfast selection. Staff friendly and efficient, nothing too much trouble. Room very comfortable and spacious. Both room and en-suite spotlessly clean. Travelling on my own I felt very safe and secure. Can't fault it at all. Would stay again. 
4; A really good hotel, with lift from Paddington Station concourse to reception. Luggage stored on final day after checkout and comfortable seating area in which to wait till boarding train on return journey. 
4; Just returned from their special Chez Nous Sunday night stay. Included, bed breakfast and three course evening meal with a complimentary glass of wine on arrival. I had asked for a room with a shower and we were given a disabled ground floor room. The bathroom was a delighted with stainless steel rails instead of the obtrusive white blended so well, a huge bed and everything you need in your room to make a pleasant stay. The Jacobean building is amazing, a warren of rooms. We treated ourselves to a cream tea recommended the scones were amazing. Evening meal was delicious couldn't manage a dessert. Spent the rest of the evening relaxing in a huge chair in front of real fire just reading, lovely. We wanted an overnight relax and that's what we got. Breakfast this morning, well the help yourself part was amazing I have stayed in many hotels over the years but the choice offered here surpasses them all. Cooked options again spoilt for choice I had smoked salmon with lettuce and tomato. Normally comes with scrambled egg but I am allergic to those so my alternative request was accepted without any issues. None of the crockery matches which actually adds to the charm. I would wholehearted recommend a stay here. 
4; I had my entire wedding day here and can I just say it was the most PERFECT day ever with the weather to compliment. From planning to the day later we couldn't fault anyone. Every single member of staff couldn't do enough for us. It really was like a dream!!!! A very special THANK YOU to everyone working my wedding day: Firstly Bridget Wells for all her hard work arranging the day itself and all the help and guidance she gave us. I couldn't ask for anyone better to plan my wedding with, super happy and very very helpful. Andrea who dealt with the day itself was amazing and every second of the day went so smoothly like it was planned to the last second. So polite and helpful (even though the groom forgot to do certain things like remember to get the rings out and to hand over his phone for the songs lol) All the hard working happy staff working on my wedding, namely: Ashley, Lottie,Meg, Ed & Damian Thank you all from the very bottom of our hearts for giving us our dream wedding. All so lovely and couldn't do enough. The food was to die for (we had veg starter(thick and delicious), beef main(OMG AMAZING beef fell to pieces) and sticky toffee sponge & custard for desert(Delicious)) Our evening was fabulous too. A very unforgettable day all together with the most amazing staff and guests. We paid for extra rooms for some guests and I have to say the hotel was very accommodating regarding extra beds in rooms as we have 6 children ourselves. The rooms were pristine, clean and smelt lovely. The Bridal suit was huge and not to mention the comfy bed lol. After the night time had ended myself(Bride) and groom along with friends and family all got together in our room to chat about our day (more or less carried on the night into the early hours)  Moving on to Breakfast in the morning, It was lovely, a great choice of food and drinks all red hot and so nice I could eat there every morning haha. From the bottom of both (Bride & Groom) our hearts THANK YOU for making our special day PERFECT in EVERY way possible. We highly recommend having a wedding here, amazing views, friendly staff, food that's to die for and accommodation that was just lovely. If we could we'd give it 100 stars a million times over. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE xxxxxxxxxxx 
4; Our Granddaughters wedding was the first wedding we have attended in an Hotel. It was an amazing experience and just perfect from start to finish. The staff were obviously trained very well and experienced and were on hand at all time to check if everything was to our satisfaction and if we required anything. The Hotel and grounds are each beautiful in their own way.  We checked out having had a wonderful stay and the wanting to stay at the Hotel again. 
4; We recently stayed in a lovely cottage in Stainforth but the only down-side to our few days in North Yorkshire was lack of restaurants that were dog-friendly.........until we came across this beautiful hotel. On a very cold day the open log fire was most welcoming and we were delighted that we could bring our (house trained and well-behaved) pup into the bar area. Food was of a very high standard, the decor was stunning and tasteful and the staff were courteous and helpful. We'll definitely be returning to the area and to this lovely hotel. 
4; We were lucky enough to be invited to a wedding that was held at Wynyard Hall Hotel. The grounds and entrance are very impressive. The bar was clean and warm and very festive. The room where the couple were married was beautifully set out and there was two large real fires burning. We did think that there was a bit of a smoky smell. The meal was excellent and the service was smooth and professional. We didn't think that the bar prices were too high considering the setting. 
4; We stayed for a 2 night break to include the New Year's Eve Ball which was excellent. Plenty of staff to hand on the evening for the event. Room very spacious as 3 Adults stayed and Food Excellent. We'll be back 
4; My daughter had her wedding reception at Cheltenham park hotel at the end of june 2013. The venue, staff, accomadation could not be faulted in any way. The service we recieved we exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. My husband and I had our wedding reception there 32 years ago and I would certainly say that the experiece was just as excellent them as it is now. 
4; With out a doubt the best place i have stayed. The Cranleigh was recommended by a friend. Dont want to tell too many friends as may not be able to get booked in next time. The staff were so friendly and could not do enough to help. The attention to detail. The rooms were not showing any signs of wear, they were so clean. We stayed in room 12 the spa bath was luxury the lighting gave great atmosphere and TV. Great big bed, crisp like new bedding, rose petals, chocolates and Iced bucket with champagne really did make it very special. Breakfast was fantastic great welcoming services. Stayed two nights. The first day my partner asked me to marry him so he ordered another bottle of champagne for our second night. We Came back after day out to find room back spotless, I am sure we had new fresh towels, bubble bath had all been re stocked. The bed re made with more rose petals in heart shape on the bed more complimentry chocolates and a card from the hotel congratulating us on our engagement. The hotel made a special weekend even more memorable. Will definatley be going again superb. The owners need to know what a wounderful team of staff they have working for them which really are an assett to the place. 
4; We had booked to stay in this hotel for a special occasion and we were seeing a show. We had previously made reservations at a restaurant in Liverpool for 5 to make it to the theatre for 7. We couldn't check into our room until 3pm so arrived a little early to ensure we could have a shower and get ready in plenty of time. Our room was not yet ready so we were offered a complementary drink in the hotel restaurant whilst we waited for our room. At 3:30 our room was ready and we went to get ready, however when we got into our room (which was absolutely lovely) the shower door had come off it's runner and maintenance were going to have to get a new part so we couldn't use the shower. I called reception and explained my upset that this was a special occasion and we were very upset as we feel we did not have enough time to get ready and that this had put a real dampener on the trip. Within 10 minutes, a girl from the reception was at our door with a new key, she took us to Morgan's vault which was out of this world and offered us a bottle of prosecco. The room was amazing, sleeping 20 people and we were rattling around in there but it was such a great experience. We hurriedly got ready and went to our meal and show. Once we got back we enjoyed a lovely jacuzzi bath and had our bottle of prosecco. The breakfast in the morning was lovely and the staff were extremely attentive. What started out to be a little disappointing turned into the best night away that we have ever experienced. Thank you so much to all the staff at this hotel, we loved our time here and would definitely return in the future. 
4; Stayed here for my partner's birthday. Had a great time. Only 5 mins walk to the seafront, shops within one minute. Excellent location. Remember to ask for as many wifi codes as you have devices and get the Ipod cable from reception when you arrive. Great hotel. 
4;Just had an overnight romantic stay here, got a great deal on the Suite La Grande Dame with a £75 spend in the restaurant, the room was lovely and felt like a real treat. Drinks at the cosy bar and the batman was helpful and changed our reservation as we were taking a walk.  Restaurant was nice, tables well spaced, food was good but not really worth the £121 price tag with drinks. My mussels were in a very plain broth, also my dessert was not very good, billed as a tropical pavola I expected a fresh meringue but it was solid and shop felt shop bought, they also forgot the rum cream it was a bit of a letdown, I still ate it though. Not bad just felt could have been better.  Batman then created some cocktails, they were lovely, made with care and attention.  Spotless place, felt really luxurious, reception staff also couldn't do enough for you.  Would DEFINETELY go again for a romantic getaway.
4; On a cold night we walked into the warm and friendly reception for a speedy check in. Through our own error we'd mis booked location for a second night and the reception staff arranged to change our booking at no charge. We were then upgraded, a new key delivered to our room when the current one stopped working.   I am impressed enough to write an immediate review. Why can't all Hiltons be like this!!! 
4; Great Hotel from the moment you enter until the moment you leave all the hotel team welcoming and helpful especially with the tube strike advising on buses the hotel is very close to a bus station next to angel tube station from which we travelled around very easily. Room with walk in rainforest shower great!! The varied breakfast was a wonderful selection each day with a chef on hand. The highlight was when I returned from being out for my birthday to find a surprise dessert, balloons, and birthday card signed by the hotel team rounding off my birthday with a smile 
4; I came up to London for one night and stayed at the Doubletree by Hilton. The rooms were extremely modern, clean and comfortable. Room we had was on the small side but nevertheless quiet and came with all the mod cons. We booked fairly close to going so the price we paid was £120.00 which I thought was reasonable for a hotel in London on Saturday night. We didn’t eat at the hotel and went out to some local bars in the evening so unsure on what the hotel has to offer on that part. Worth staying and would stay with this company again as they have hotels all over the capital. 
4; In contrast to the previous reviewer, we have just returned from a truly enjoyable 6-night stay at the Frenchgate hotel and restaurant. We were in the Napoli suite which was light, spacious and very comfortable. This is one of the better hotels we have stayed in. There are inevitably some limitations providing accommodation in a historic building such as this, which is situated in a delightful cobbled street in the heart of Richmond, but the hotel offers modern facilities with a bar, an outside covered space and a pretty garden. The car park, although small, is also unusual for a town centre hotel. The breakfast menu was extensive (and the freshly cooked breakfast served hot and beautifully presented) but to really appreciate this hotel you need to experience lunch or dinner in the intimate restaurant adorned with artwork. We dined in the hotel every day and every meal was different, delicious and of the highest standard. Two sets of firends who joined us for lunch on two occasions have also expressed their enjoyment of the experience. The owner, David, and his team provide genuine, warm Yorkshire hospitality and we are looking forward to returning to this exceptional hotel at the earliest opportunity. 
4; Just back from staying the weekend at Number Four. The hotel is amazing. We have stayed in many B&Bs in and around Portsmouth but this is by far the best. Arriving on Friday night to be greeted by your welcoming staff, transferred FOC by taxi to and from The Kitchen restaurant. Our meal was the best out for a long time. Service and staff spot on. Our room (no.4) was very comfortable and with tea or coffee delivered as requested, very refreshing. Excellent choice for breakfast and very good service too. Will be back. Many thanks for an excellent weekend. 
4; A little gem, as soon as you walk throught the doors you relax it has a very laid back atmosphere but every last detail has been thought about. We went for a weekend break and will definitely go back there again. The food in the restaurant was absolutely superb, staff were very attentive but not intrusive. This is somewhere that you want to congratulate the owners and tell people but then you also want to keep it just for you. Superb the owners and staff take a pride in what they do. Thank you for a fabulous weekend break 
4; I attended an annual dinner and dance, had a lovely evening with friends. Dinner was lovely and it was nice to be able to pick what starters and mains you wanted on the night. Lovely venue and staff were very friendly, looking forward to returning again. 
4; I booked a spa package for four people as a treat after a tough few months at work. The package was for an overnight stay, including dinner, bed and breakfast, two spa treatments and a two course lunch. The entire experience was more than we could ever have hoped for, and we were made to feel like royalty by David Maundrill and his team. The food was wide ranging and delicious, service superb and rooms the height of luxury. The spa itself was intimate and relaxing, not too busy which was lovely and the treatments provided the relaxation and escape we were all looking for. If you are searching for a high quality, yet good value experience then I can't recommend Wood Hall strongly enough. 
4; We first discovered Summer Lodge in July 2004, when we were looking for a relaxing country house break where we could take our dogs. We found several hotels listed in the Relais Chateaux guide that said dogs welcome. On further enquiry, large dogs were not welcome and often the dogs were not allowed in the rooms. This was not the case at Summer Lodge. As a result of our first very positive experience with Summer Lodge, we have returned many times since. In 2010 we hosted a birthday celebration for 24 guests over four days. It was a truely memorable event and our friends and family are still talking about it. All the staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed the excellent cuisine of chef Stevphen Titman and his staff and our guests were very impressed by the wines we selected with some guidance from Eric Zwiebel, the resident cellar master. We were very fortunate to have good weather during our four days and as a result we were able to make full use of the outdoor facilities including lawn chess, croquet and tennis, as well as the gym, pool and spa. We have just returned from our most recent break with our two Flatcoat Retrievers. Summer Lodge has become our escape and a home away from home....but with very nice staff to look after us. It says a lot for any hotel when you are still returning after ten years and are welcomed by the same key staff. 
4; Have visited the hotel twice now for afternoon tea and can honestly say it's wonderful. The long drive up the driveway past the lake and swans I beautifully scenic. The building itself is very impressive. The lady on reception, Charlotte was brilliant. Very professional but warm and welcoming. She really looked after us and we felt special in the the downtown abbey style surroundings. She showed us into the gorgeous library room where a small table was waiting for us in the window. Excellent customer service. The views out onto the lawn is idyllic and sheep wondered over towards late afternoon which is nice. Decor is very traditional which I love. The China is modern but but traditional in style. We had both tea and prosecco which was a real treat. Sandwiches were delicious and cakes and scones were lovely. A sand timer was brought out with the tea which was a first for us as we have afternoon tea's regularly but appreciated that 'extra touch' and meant we enjoyed our extra brewed tea more too. Plenty to keep you going for hours! We sat for 2 hours and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. We felt relaxed and throughly enjoyed the experience. can't wait to return, I bet Chritmas time is magical. 
4; Had a one night stay in a standard double room. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome and all of our requests were met with no fuss.The hotel has a great vibe with a very contemporary feel esp in the bar and surrounding lobby area. Our room was a very good size for a big city hotel and all of the room amenities were of a high standard. In addition we did not encounter the usual noise from rooms to the side or above or below us so our sleep was not disrupted.  The hotel is a 2 min walk to both Manchester Piccadilly Station and Metrolink. 
4; I booked the hotel as my partner is doing his basic training close by, the hotel gives me the chance to stay for the weekend and see him Saturday and Sunday. Due to problems I wasn't able to see him on the Saturday as originally planned however the hotel offered the chance to use their spa. When I arrived I didn't expect much with the car park being full of coaches, however when I arrived through the doors I was impressed with interior, the place was clean and decorated wonderfully.  It was a bit of a nightmare following the stairs all the way to the third floor, I found that I was walking down a lot of hallways just to get to the next set of stairs, however the room made up for this. It was decorated in warm colours and the bed was so comfy unlike the Royal Winchester. The shower was a little annoying as the temperature kept changing on me and the WIFI didn't work very well from the 3rd floor. Apart from a few minor things the staff were very polite and friendly, willing to help with any problem or enquiry, I'd defiently recommend staying! 
4; My fiancé and I always stay here when we come to London because it's close to a mainline station (5 mins walk from London Waterloo), it's very comfortable, has all the mod cons, it's quiet and incredibly central and the food is lovely. It basically just checks all the boxes.  We generally stay in the basic room and don't mind if it's interior facing, it's still quite light. The rooms are warm and comfortable with a large comfortable bed, plenty of wardrobe space, coffee/tea and even a separate lounge area which is small but perfectly suited to a short stay. The bathroom is spacious and the shower is powerful plus they have baths which can be quite a novelty in modern hotels. We always have breakfast which is the usual mix of continental and a fry up so you can eat healthily (which I prefer) or treat yourself and it's very good quality. You're so close to the mainline and underground stations that you can navigate the wonders of London without ever being too far from home. Yes, it is a bit more expensive but for us it's worth every single penny every time. Our only negative is the queue to check in is always long (a sign of heir popularity, it's also perhaps as they are under staffed?). The staff in the bar and outside the hotel are so friendly, always looking to help or get you a taxi. We'll definitely be back here many times! 
4;Excellent hotel, staff very friendly, hotel room very clean, and very comfortable. Close to all amenities. Excellent value for money, i would recommend this hotel for couples and familys a very enjoyable stay  
4; We stayed here on new years eve because we had tickets to old trafford that day.   The hotel was in an excellent location, it was only about 15 minutes walk to old trafford, 5 minutes from salford quays and right next door to booths.  The room was spacious, modern and clean, definitely nicer than some more expensive hotels I have stayed in previously. There was also a desk right by a big mirror, hair dryer and several sockets which was perfect for me to get ready! I would also imagine that this would be convenient if you were staying here for work purposes. The view was also great because we could see the whole of salford, which was particularly amazing at midnight when all of the new year fireworks went off.  The bathroom was immaculate and spacious, with very nice shower gel! The whole room and bathroom looked newly rennovated.  The breakfast was brilliant, everything you could ask for was prepared. I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely return. 
4;We stayed at Oakley Hall in the Spring and couldn't wait to return as it was by far the best hotel we have booked and such a wonderful deal with Travelzoo. The courtyard rooms are finished to such a high standard with little touches like fresh milk and mineral water in the fridge in your room. Fruit and choccies, also a complimentary paper delivered to you the next morning.  The staff are friendly and welcoming and the 5 course taster menu was excellent, particularly the lamb. The panna cotta was the only disappointing element of the meal. Hope the offer is repeated as we will definately return, we recommend it to all our friends.
4;Stayed here on a groupon deal. It's a super hotel & the reception staff were very welcoming. Our room was clean & fresh, if a little dated - but had everything we needed. The restaurant food & staff were lovely - self service meal - but we were happy with that. Breakfast was super & again the staff were pleasant & polite! Only 2 minor issues - there was a year 6 Prom in a function room & the bar was awash with 10 & 11 year olds! They weren't in any way disruptive but just a bit giddy! The staff on the bar did a sterling job but there clearly wasn't enough of them & they ran out of glasses too. The tables in the bar & courtyard were left uncleared so it was a bit messy. I put that down to the fact that there weren't enough staff available for a busy Friday night! It didn't really affect our stay though & we would be more than happy to recommend.
4; Have just returned from a short break at the Grim's Dyke hotel. What a lovely surprise! Great food, wonderful staff and service(Nothing too much trouble) and very clean, beautifully furnished,spacious rooms. The hotel has lots of history and the grounds are truly wonderful and very well kept. Great location too.Will definitely be returning. 
4; We have just spent a wonderful weekend here. We were a family group with ages ranging from 20 to 80 years. The rooms are beautiful but the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing with staff being very helpful and friendly. I loved being able to walk outside from my bedroom. The food is fantastic with well cooked generous breakfasts. 
4;" My partner & I had an overnight stay at Macdonald Townhouse Hotel as we were attending a jazz session in Manchester and thought it would be nice to stay over. This proved to be an excellent choice and great value for money. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff, they attended to our every need and even presented us with 2 glasses of champagne (in our room) to celebrate my partners birthday - which was a lovely touch. The room was most satisfactory with a wonderful comfy bed and well fitted out bathroom (with a lovely rainfall shower). The breakfast (free with our package) was excellent; cooked fresh to order with a buffet of fresh fruit, juices, cereals, pastries and much more. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to others. Thank you for a most pleasant stay. "
4;We checked in for mums 50th Birthday.   The staff were so welcoming and friendly. The service was outstanding.   We found a celebration treat in our room which was such a lovely surprise.   The staff went above and beyond expectations to ensure we were looked after.  The room was clean and comfortable.   The food was lovely   I can not thank all the staff enough for making our stay such a special event.   All the staff are a credit to this Boutique. We will be returning.  Highly recommended to all.
4;"Stayed here twice when away with work. I feel relaxed just walking into the Hotel and reception area; the candles and the lighting are just great after a day of meetings! All staff so friendly and can't do enough for you. My door card did not work and as I was about to troll back to reception, Alex passed and sorted it all out for me.  The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean; little touches make such a difference, like real milk in a little bottle rather than the individual tiny pots pretending to be fresh milk. I've only ever had breakfast here but the choice and freshness is great. Again the waiting staff will get whatever you need, and always with a smile. Also have only used the pool when I've stayed, a bonus when away with work. Next time I plan to stay for pleasure rather than business and make full use of the spa facilities. I can honestly say I can find no fault with this hotel as yet."
4; We were worried about getting anywhere in the vicinity at short notice and when we got two rooms for my family at the Bristol Aztec and Spa I was concerned that it might be a little circumspect. How wrong I was. It turned out to be exactly what my family and I had be looking for. The staff were extremely courteous and professional. The furnishings of this hotel were excellent and of a 5 star quality. The swimming pool, fitness room, steam room etc were great. I wished we had spent more time here. The breakfast I would thoroughly recommend. Sometimes you are subject to 'catering standard' sausages and bacon, but not here. The cooked breakfast, which was served by one of the staff, was one of the best I have ever eaten. It was included in the price but, after inquiring, I found that  I could order anything from the menu, not just the food on visual offer. 
4; I always stay at this hotel when I am in London. It is very convenient for the underground and the bus networks. The staff are always very friendly, polite and helpful and nothing is 'too much'. For the price the rooms are adequate, the club rooms are well equipped, and very comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to stay for a few nights in central London without paying extortionate room rates. 
4; I really enjoyed staying here during the SF Ball from 6 - 9 Feb 2015. My room on floor 3 was nicely furnished, had a lovely view of the harbour as well a really comfortable king size bed. I also liked the wide choice of channels on the TV including Sky Sports and Sky Atlantic and appreciated the free wifi. Food was excellent and the service from all the staff was A1. 
4; I had reason to come to Chester, and was advised I should stay at the Double Tree. This recommendation was spot on! From the helpful and friendly staff, to the quality of the food and rooms.. just a lovely stay. Should I need to work in Chester again, I will definitely be back. 
4;" I use St Michael's Manor occasionally for business meetings, I haven't yet eaten there, but I love the decor and friendly, efficient service. I've brought friends here who were visiting from the states, they really enjoyed the setting and proper English &quot;hot&quot; tea.  I discovered in when looking for a local business which had air conditioning during the few heat waves we had in the summer. I worked in their lounge from my laptop in the cool, was able to order drinks for me and clients as I needed them, and settle the bill at the end. "
4; We have just spent a lovely weekend at Sea-la-Vie. We went to Portsmouth mainly to visit the Historical Dockyard and despite not spending much time at the house, would recommend it to other visitors. The initial welcome made us feel at home immediately, with nothing too much trouble for our hostess, Eileen. Just state your likes and dislikes at this stage and everything will be attended to. This was a weekend where we very much wanted to 'do our own thing' but Eileen was happy to recommend things to do, places to see and places to eat. Our room was beautifully decorated and the bed was extremely comfortable, with the additional touch of lavender pouches to help us get to sleep as soon as our heads touched the pillows! She was happy to provide crystal glasses if we wanted to bring wine back to our room and we really would have liked to spend some time relaxing outside but sadly, didn't have the time due to our itinerary. The location is great - just a short walk from the shore, Southsea Castle and many other museums and attractions. Get a street map though as we walked the long way round to the Dockyard and Gunwharf Quays - our fault because we didn't ask Eileen for advice on this! Our breakfast waiter, Lawrence, was out to please and again, nothing was too much trouble. The house is beautifully 'warm' and welcoming, smelt wonderful and we will definitely go back again and recommend it to others. 
4; MY husband and I only stayed 1 night, but we had a huge room with a kingsize bed, we had a good range of beverages, plus a bottle of mineral water and a bowl of fresh fruit. There were slippers and robes in the room too. The room was very clean and the staff were very good too, we had a pre-dinner drink in the bar which was a very nice room. The meal we had in the restaurant was excellent and the staff very friendly, we had a full English breakfast in the morning and once again the variety was excellent so too the service, I woul definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. 
4; We very much enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We had a lovely room with a King Size bed with a lovely spacious bathroom. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the hotel. Matthew on Reception was extremely helpful :)  Would deffinantly recommend at stay here. 
4; Just returned from a fabulous two night stay (3rd - 5th May) to celebrate our 22nd Wedding Anniversary. Please could I just say that myself and my Hubby have stayed in many Hotels of high calibre, since returning I have read some negative reviews, however we would suggest that Armathwaite Hall is definately scoring high on our favourites!!!! We rarely stay in the same hotel twice, however we are already looking at returning during the christmas festivites.  Please ignore the 'Nit Pickers'!!!!!!!, this beautiful country house is oozing with character and boasts some wonderful displays of Olde English Heritage, (There is a clue in the 'look' of the building as to maybe what can be expected from the inside). A courtyard extension hosts a magnificent modern and very clean Spa.  Upon arrival we were greeted with refreshments, and had a friendly and prompt check-in. We were shown to our room and offered assistance with luggage. We had a double room in the main part of the Building (Room 171). The room was extremely comfortable and of an adequate size, yes there is a hairdryer fixed into a drawer which requires the switch to be continually pressed whilst in use but that is ok, I wouldnt particularly make a big deal out of it!! The room was well equipped with refreshments ie, tea, coffe, hot choc, biscuits, bottled water - any of which were replenished at the evening 'turn down' service had we used them during the day, Thankyou.  The bathroom was exceptionally clean, adequate toiletries, heated towel rail and scented toilet paper, power shower, all perfectly acceptable. The view from the window was over the courtyard (not picturesque) however once we had found the Spa we were only ever in the room to sleep, so never really noticed the view. Staff were extremely friendly, polite and very attentive!!!!! Breakfast was fab, plenty of choice - full english, toast, cereals, croissants, fruit, yoghurts, tea, coffee, juice etc... We had table in the Lake View restaurant for Dinner and the food was exquisite!!!  Chefs that are absolutely talented in 'fine dinning'!!!!! (My background is as a chef myself, so I also know a little about good fresh quality food, and flavours) The portions sizes were perfect, we ate everything!!!!! Wine was quality and reasonably priced. A massive mention to our waiter 'anatoulizs' - He was one of the best we've ever been served by!! THEN - we found the Spa OMG!!!!!!!! Pure indulgence, we spent two days relaxing in the beautiful facilities. No one EVER hassled us to have any treatments (this was amazing!!) we swam, used the modern gym, enjoyed the thermal suite - aroma room, tropical shower, rainforest shower, steam room, sauna, jaccuzzi, all communal, BUT most of all we thoroughly indulged in the outdoor Hot Tub, enjoying a glass of Champagne to celebrate our Anniversary. Towels, robes and slippers were all provided, as was shampoo, conditioner and body wash. There was flowing cool drinking water to ensure that you remained well hydrated, and like I said - NO pressure to do anything other than 'Chill out', Relax, and Enjoy. There was a Brasserie within the Spa environment where we had lunch in our robes one day - very nice. Two other couples were also sharing our special weekend by celebrating their Wedding Days, it was a pleasure to see them, yet they had no impact upon the tranquility of the rest of the hotel whatsoever. Unfortunately we did have to eventually check-out, which was also prompt, However!!! Guess what????? YES we were still able to use the Spa facilities for a few hours before travelling back home.  We would really like to thank Armathwaite Hall for a wonderful stay! We will definately be back!!! If we felt the need to 'Nit pick', after a lot of searching the only thing we could come up with was that the toast was underdone at breakfast - Sorry.... 
4; We have had a lovely time at the Bacchus Hotel, staff are amazing can't do enough for you and always with a smile.Food is very good and very reasonably priced. Dog friendly.  Rooms are very clean and comfy, TV. Could do with being a bit larger screen wise. But this is a very small negative. Breakfast is full English and well worth it's title,super. Service again with a smile. You would go along way to beat this hotel in this area and  Deserves it's five stars. We will return again next year. Let's hope the little black bugs are not on the beach next time, Parking is behind the hotel which was ample. Thanks once again to all staff. Keep up the excellent service. Joyce and John,Lucy. 
4; Hubby took me for afternoon tea ,spot on much recommended great service amazing lounge cakes too die for and just the right amount Proseco was a good price considering location. Try it you wont be dis-appointed 
4; unfortunately somehow our booking got mixed up and immediate panic set in, having driven four hours to find our room had been booked elsewhere and not at Crowne Plaza as we thought. However this minor irritation was excellently and professionally delt with by Joanna and resolved within 20 minutes. We were then given a suburb room and had a fantastic stay ending up staying an extra night. If you want quality in every area this really is the place to stay. We have stayed before and will be returning in Novemeber. Congratulations Crowne Plaza Kensington you should be proud of the service you provide in every area. 
4; I stayed at this hotel on a weekend one-night spa break with friends. As we were travelling from different cities the location was ideal - just off the M1. Picked from a google search we were surprised to find we had stumbled across such a fantastic place!  We took advantage of the pool, steam room, sauna and jacuzzi in the afternoon, and relaxed in the outdoor seats with a drink. The pool was large, and the spa areas were a good size, clean and new, with freely provided towels, robes and slippers, this was an excellent way to chill out. We had booked the dinner bed and breakfast deal, and were pleasantly surprised to see a wide choice of food on the menu, with no restrictions or extra charges applied (I dislike seeing each main course offered at a supplment cost as happens often on set menus at other places). The food was exceptionally good - service excellent and helpful. We chose to take teas and coffees in the central inner courtyard which ended the evening brilliantly. The following morning, breakfast was equally varied and plentiful.   Throughout the whole stay the staff were extremely helpful and made sure everyone was having a good stay. In the brochure the chain state that their staff are not just passing through - rather are there to stay - and this shows.  Well done Shire Hotels - a great weekend break! 
4;A fabulous hotel, friendly staff and great location. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had two great nights sleep. The location is great, right by the restaurant filled part of town. There were nice touches in the room - good quality toiletries and a Nespresso machine. All round a great weekend in great accommodation.
4; I can't understand the last negative comment but each to their own as they say! We stayed here for two nights and thought the place was lovely,excellent choice of breakfast and the dinner was superb! would stay again! 
4; Stayed at the hotel whilst attending 2 day sales conference. Fantastic food, service, bedrooms. Lunch was amazing with a selection of different choices from around the world. Dinner was superb, lamb was succulent, champagne sorbet followed by trio of desserts to die for. Bedrooms very comftable, great nights sleep and great power shower. 
4; We have been visiting Tylney Hall regularly in the last 23 years and have seen it grow in all directions. The grounds are a delight, beautifully maintained and just a peaceful, relaxing sight to behold with varying species of trees, shrubs, ponds, bridges and long vista plus a herb garden.The staff could not have been more friendly, helpful and attentive to our every need. Dining is of a very high standard,whilst a talented pianist plays every evening. In our eyes the hotel gets better and better. We are looking forward to our next visit. 
4; Booked as birthday treat for my husband. When we opened the door to our room on the 24th floor we were both blown away! It was magnificent! A corner room with two walls of floor to ceiling windows! The bed was in the middle of the room with a tv positioned so you could watch it in bed, then behind the bed a small partition then two chairs and footstools and another tv! The ensuite had a huge drench shower and double trough type sink. This room also had floor to ceiling windows (frosted glass). Bathrobes and slippers were provided along with complimentary mini-bar (2 lagers, bottle of red and white wine, still and sparkling water, kitkat and chilli rice cakes)! As it was my husband's birthday they even put a plate of home made chocolate brownies in the room and had written happy birthday in chocolate on the plate! We visited Marco Pierre White's for a lunch time snack and were lucky to get a table by the window. The handcut chips were lovely! Breakfast was served in MPW's restaurant. We were greeted and offered a glass of bucks fizz! Again we had a table by the window where we enjoyed our breakfast. Plenty of choice both healthy and perhaps not so but hey it was lovely! All of the staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had a great stay. Can't wait to go back again. Would definitely recommend hotel indigo! 
4; What a fantastic hotel!! The rooms were of a very high standard and completely unique.  The staff were all charming and a credit to the hotel. Every time I stay in Portsmouth, i'll be staying here, brilliant! 
4; Really lovely hotel in great location. Booked this for a theatre break to see Warhorse. Drury Lane theatres and Coventry Garden both within easy walking distance, also just along the road from the British museum. Very comfortable hotel, we arrived earlier than the 3pm check in but just left cases and wandered off to have lunch at nearby Italian restaurant . Superb stay. 
4; Hotel was excellent with super facilities. We ate in Robata and really enjoyed the food and service. The sky bar had an excellent female singer on when we visited which finished the night brilliantly. The spa is lovely and was quiet when we visited. The outside hot tub was fabulous!! Would highly recommend. 
4; We stayed on Father's Day spent most of Sunday on decking with family sitting in sun chilling celebrating fathers day my mums birthday and our anniversary then had a lovely evening meal looked after by Levi stayed in mulberry suite so chuffed everything perfect staff lovely great atmosphere can't wait to stay again thanks everyone from Lisa and nick Ellis xx 
4; We stayed in the Bowline room which has a wonderful view over the harbour and the sea in the distance. Friendly staff, excellent location and a nice dinner in the evening in comfortable surroundings. We will stay again. 
4; My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights, from the minute we arrived it was excellent service, the staff are all very friendly and stop to say hello, the reception staff very helpful. Nothing is too much trouble.   The room was lovely, very spacious and really clean, couldn't find a bit of dust if i'd tried! The bathroom was really clean and a nice selection of toiletries was included!  The location of the hotel was perfect, right in Trafalgar square, so close to everything. But once inside our hotel room you can't hear any of the outside noise, so had a great nights sleep!  We didn't use the restaurant or bar, as we had pre arranged plans during our stay, but it looked nice and seemed busy in the evenings.   I would love to stay again! 
4; As a young couple (21+22) we have never stayed somewhere this luxurious. We decided to spend more than usual as it was our anniversary of 5 years. The price is high due to it being located in such a popular city. We paid £130 for one night with continental breakfast in the morning (this was a non-refundable advanced booking).  The room was lovely, however i did think it was going to be a little bigger, but i wasn't dissapointed (maybe i just thought this because of the price!). The bathroom floor was tiled and HEATED! I loved this, i woke up twice in the night and both times thought i would have to walk on a cold tiled floor, but no! The bed was huge, it felt like i had a double to myself, the pillows were really comfy and overall we both had a really good nights sleep.  The staff were very helpful, when we arrived to check in we were told they offered a complimentary 'turndown' service so i replied 'ok' thinking, i'll phone my mum when we get to the room to ask what that is as i didn't want to look silly, but as i said ok she had written 'yes' on her paperwork. We then realised later that evening around 730-8 when a gentleman knocked on our door asking if we would like fresh towels and to close our curtains-this is what the turndown service was-you all probably know this anyway!  Breakfast was lovely, a continental breakfast was included in our stay. On offer was 4 types of cereal, croissants and pan au chocolat, mixed basket of toast, fresh fruit, orange juice, teas, coffees, hot chocolates etc.  A taxi ride into the centre (Bridge Street) costed us £5.80 this was only 5-7minutes i would say. To drive into town we were advised to park in Park Street car park as it was the cheapest of them all (up to 3 hours £5.20 i think after that i went up to over £8). It is ideally located, you walk out onto Bridge Street, if you turn immedicately right, you can go punting on the river for £20 (self-punt up to 6 people for this price). I think to have a tour it was £14 each. There are a few different companies that do it, as we 'punted' up the river we noticed one that did it for £14 (self punt) but there boats looked tatty, whereas we had a pretty decent one! If you turn left you will head into the centre, past the old sweet shop-which i obviously had to visit!   Overall a lovely stay, Cambridge is a beautiful city with plenty to offer, museums, punting, architecture, lovely restaurants, boutiques.  We definately reccomment the Felix Hotel, it is in a brilliant location, if you wanted to walk we were told it would be 30 minutes, it didn't look like a very exciting walk either.  If you want to be situated right in the centre, be prepared to pay for it!  Hope this review helped. 
4; A one night stay for a special occasion which was just perfect. I cannot fault anything with this hotel from the greeting when we arrived, the room, cleanliness, food, staff all perfect. We had our dog with us and she was made equally welcome. Looking forward to our next visit. 
4; Recently stayed at Rudding Park to escape and chill for my 60th and had a truly brilliant stay. We have stayed numerous times before for birthday treats and have never been disappointed. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite on this occasion and this really had to wow factor and made our stay even more special. As always the staff were all brilliant, unpretentious and friendly with a lovely welcome as soon as we arrived. Cheers to you all for a memorable 60th birthday! 
4; This is possibly the most amazing hotel and venue we have had the pleasure of spending time at. The whole place is amazing and over a whole weekend there was not ONE.... Get that....not ONE complaint, moan or criticism from our 70 plus guests - the majority stayed for two nights. The place is like a fairytale and cannot be faulted...and trust me we have very high standards!  One friend commented that the staff had a magical touch and somehow managed to make every guest feel special... What a lovely thing to say. The whole team is amazing. Everyone from reception, bar staff, cuddly Dudley the chef were just lovely. For us the Queen and King are Sandie and Keith..... They ran our wedding like a well oiled machine with the lightest and friendliest of touches. Nothing was too much trouble. We are proud to now count them amongst our friends.  There's is so much more we could say but there's no point... You can't say more than 'perfect in every way'. Thank you all so much from the friends and family of Alan and Liz Quiney-Marshall.   
4; High expectations from this classic hotel, we were not disappointed. Spectacular views,great location,very comfortable rooms with excellent facilities. Dining experience first rate in elegant surroundings with first rate service. one small niggle was poor choice in quality of bread at breakfast.  
4;Myself, my husband and son have just had a three nightt stay at The Carlyon Bay Hotel at St. Austell, and wish it could have been longer. The reception staff gave us a good welcome when we arrived, our bags were then delivered to our room, a lovely start to our holiday. We had a lovely sea view room, which was very spacious, well furnished! with a large on-suite bathroom, our son had a double room, overlooking the garden at the front of the hotel, and was also very pleased. The resturant, at the back of the hotel, and overlooking the sea, was beautifully furnished, the food and the service was superb. We used the indoor pool several times during our stay, the changing room was spotless, the staff friendly and helpful, with fresh towels provided at the end of your swim.  We are hoping to come back later in the year, as we all had such a good time.
4; Myself and my husband stayed at this hotel overnight, when we went to see a show at the Bristol Hippodrome. The hotel was lovely, very clean with excellent facilities. We used the hotel pool which was very warm and relaxing. We were offered breakfast on arrival for an extra £10 per head which was very good value and although it was very busy tree was plenty of choice. Our room was spacious with all facilities. We would use this hotel again. 
4; What a fantastic hotel! My partner found a deal that included breakfast and checkout at 3pm for two ppl - £57 all in!  Great service great food great location. Highly recommend this hotel for any type of stay.   Two thumbs up! 
4; Sea-la-Vie was the perfect place to relax. Warm welcome, excellent service and very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was full and used high quality ingredients and produce. All the little 'touches' to make your stay comfortable were provided. Perfect for couples, good location for local restaurants (short walk) and attractions. 
4; Visited Hotel du Vin to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday. We had a delicious meal for 21 people in a private dining room with a champagne reception beforehand in the garden . We made several changes for invididuals to the set menu and all these were accomodated. A big thank you to the manager and his staff for ensuring everything ran so smoothly  Our room was the Hugel and Jaboulet which was in a seperate annex accessed from the garden. We were very pleased with our room. It was very clean and comfortable. The bath was the biggest I have ever seen and the waterfall shower was nice.   We had breakfast in the morning. There was a good choice of cereals, pastries and toast, freshly sqeezed orange juice and the eggs benedict with bacon was very tasty.  All in all a very good choice for celebrating a special occasion - all who attended agreed. 
4; Second stay at Melia White House in London, absolutely loved it! Got upgraded to an executive king room with access to the Level Lounge with complimentary Cava. When we arrived at our room, they had made me a cake and left a card saying happy birthday. Would definitely visit again! 
4;I came to the Moathouse last night with my partner and another couple. It was our first visit but our friends had been before and recommended it. We arrived just after 7pm to advantage of the Earlybird menu and enjoyed starters, sorbet, mains, dessert and tea/coffee for about £25. With drinks on top it came to £35 per head.   The food is delicious and so well presented. We didn't leave until after 10pm, so don't expect a speedy meal. It was really relaxed and we had just enough time between courses to start feeling peckish enough for the next course! All the food was fresh and tasty and the choice was superb.  Service was to be mentioned. The staff are really professional and look after you well. My one tiny tiny thing which I feel I need to mention is that the drinks service could have been a little swifter. At one point we were sitting with empty glasses all round and nobody asked if we'd like any more drinks. That really does pail into insignificance though and certainly didn't stop me giving this place a huge 5/5.  It would be useful to know when the Early Bird menu choice changes so that we can return and try something different, although my fiance already has his eye on the 6 course tasting menu! We'll certainly be back :-)
4;We stayed here as a group of friends and had a wonderful time as the hotel surpassed our expectations - the food was great, the staff (particularly Pauline in Reception, Kiri in reservations and Gemma in the restaurant) were extremely friendly and helpful and no request was too much. The views are amazing and the golf isn't bad either - Simon led us in a lesson and was in for the laugh!  The spa is a lovely tranquil spot, but also has a time for kids to splash and play. A couple of girls had a massage - they said the treatment was lovely, but the radio noise spoilt the atmosphere a bit.  The rooms are large and spacious and the bathrooms and products are fab - only not sure what's happening with the doors - you need to be really strong to close and open them (we had to kick ours!) - a possible health and safety issue here - and one girls bathroom door didn't close at all, but it's new hotel so hopefully that will be sorted. we felt we were waking the whole hotel late at night!  apart from that small thing - we all loved the hotel and would all definitely come back!
4;" We have had our office Christmas party here 3 times and it has always been excellent, the food is fantastic and the service always attentive. Canapes in the bar are also absolutely delicious and all staff are always very impressed with the food, service and venue. Thank you.  I have also eaten in the restaurant a few times for business and pleasure and stayed in the hotel with my husband. I love the location as it is just behind a pretty square near to Smithfield which means it is peaceful but still right in the heart of the City and only a few minutes walk to Barbican or Farringdon tube; or ten minutes to St Paul's or Chancery Lane so good connections for transport and in the heart of Clerkenwell. The room we stayed in was huge with all the Mal extras. I will definitely be back.  Highly recommended for business, romance, alone or with friends. "
4; Used this hotel for business for an overnight stay, though would happily have stayed in the room for longer as it was fully equipped with a great little kitchenette. The room was very clean and spacious. Great location close to shops/ attractions and New Street Station. Although you are in the centre of Birmingham the room was very quiet and had great blackout curtains, so I got a good night's sleep. The only downside was the bed was a bit hard. Would use this Aparthotel again for business or staying in Birmingham with friends. Good value for money.  
4; Amazing customer service, all staff are so friendly and polite we felt so welcome. My boyfriend took me there for my birthday we stayed over the night and had the ginseng full body massage. It was perfect I couldn't of asked for more, but staying there for longer.  The food was amazing, best salmon I've ever had in my life, rooms are beautiful, extremely clean. Will definitely come back and stay again and again! Truly amazing! 
4; I visited the hotel with my boyfriend for my birthday using the Secret Escape deal of £249 for 2 people including breakfast, lunch, spa treatments each and a 7 course taster menu and it was incredible! Our room was huge and the bed was really comfy, the bathroom is also really impressive with a huge shower and free standing bath. The staff were all really helpful ( especially at dinner) and the highlight of the stay really had to be the incredible food! The 7 course tasting menu was fantastic and each dish was truly delicious. I would absolutely recommend staying here and would definitely love to return again soon. 
4;"This hotel is a haven of peace and tranquility, with its cheerful and professional service, excellent accommodation and delicious food and fine wines. How anyone could possibly complain about this very classy and traditional, family-run establishment is a complete mystery to me. Over the years, my husband and I have stayed there regularly with members of our family from all age groups; not one of them has ever been disappointed, and all have been keen to return a.s.a.p.    There are holiday destinations of which I'm very fond in many corners of the world; but none more so than the Cottage Hotel at Hope Cove, South Devon. So please, William, Sarah and all the Ireland family, take no notice of the occasional whingers here - some of whom appear to have nothing better to do with their time than to write great long rambling, blatantly-dishonest and spiteful reviews; clearly they would be far happier in a Travel Lodge. You can't please everyone; no one can. But the guests that are worth the enormous efforts you and your excellent staff make, will always return. Perhaps it's because of the quality of your service that you attract - for the most part - such friendly and convivial guests?   My family and I very much look forward to visiting you again next year - but PLEASE don't make too many changes to the place; like everyone else we love it dearly just as it is - just as we also love maître d’ Lisa's always immaculate turn-out, witty conversation, and stunningly beautiful hair. Well done All!"
4; Just had a 4nt Turkey and tinsel break and had a great time this was our first time in a Warner hotel and where impressed with the food and our great waitress Louisa nothing to much trouble.all amenities are great also enjoyed the entertainment and spotless clean everywhere.the only downside was distance to travel to get to the complex from the chalets.the rooms are spotless clean and comfortable beds and lovely and warm room only downside was only 1 armchair in seating area of superior room not 2 as shown in brochure but will complain next time if it is the same 
4; We have just spent the weekend at Cragwood for my daughters wedding. We could not fault the hotel at all. Philip, Rob and the rest of the staff really looked after us, nothing was too much trouble. The food was top quality, some of our guests said it was the best food they have ever had at a wedding. The tables for the wedding were set out beautifully, great attention to detail. The reception rooms and the bedrooms are really lovely, and of course, that setting is just gorgeous. 
4; Had a lovely break at this Q Hotel, the room was large and beautifully furnished, comfortable bed . Everything was very clean and the bathroom was large and very modern, We used the pool and sauna etc first class, very clean very relaxing.. Also considering how near the motorway it is , we had no problems with noise. in fact it was very peacefull. Enjoyed a wonderfull breakfast. lovely spread and very friendly staff. 
4;" Stayed at The Midland over the New Year and had a wonderful experience. Even though the hotel was fully booked, the service was exceptional; from the Reception staff to the Banqueting team. The whole stay was excellent. "
4; My partner and I visited this hotel for a bit of a spa treat and we weren't disappointed. On arrival The hotel reception area was lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We used the spa facilities which were fantastic, then had a meal in the restaurant and the food was exceptional.  We absolutely loved our stay here and cannot wait to return. Very highly recommended by us 
4; Stayed here on the 26th and the reception staff were wonderful. The hotel is very impressive and the standard is excellent. My room was amazing. Huge bed and amazing black marble bathroom detail. My view was facing Wembley stadium so that was awesome! 
4; Went for afternoon tea very friendly staff the hotel decor was also lovely. The restaurant was nicely done out the sandwiches and cakes tasted very nice you could also get a fair few cups of tea out the teapot. 
4; Stayed here 11/10/15. Overall had a lovely time. Room and Jacuzzi were great and spotless. Thanks to the manager Sean and his staff for a memorable stay. Would definitely stay again. Breakfast was varied and plentiful. Good value for money. Carole. 
4; Location is excellent for exploring the city of Liverpool, close to docks, shops, bars and restaurants. Lovely modern hotel, excellent quality in the rooms and friendly service from all staff members. Perfect base for a weekend getaway. 
4;stayed at the rising sun for a late weekend break.Hotel room was beautiful,clean and exceptionally comfortable.The hospitality was of the highest level.Food was faultless....cant wait for our next visit,would recommend this hotel to anybody...we would like to thank Alan and Sally the proprietors for making our weekend so special.
4;I just had the most lovely massage at My Hotel Bloomsbury with Christina. She was so personal and made me so relaxed, All the stress and tension in my back has gone. She gave such attention to detail and was so personal and friendly in her approach. The champagne and warm Brownies topped off my perfect day. I would definately return for a massage.
4;Thank you so much for all your efforts and many kindnesses at my parents' diamond wedding celebrations. Nothing was too much effort and everything was done with care and consideration. It was a truely memorable day and everyone had such a good time: it was all a triumph!
4;" Rudby Hall is an absolutely stunning place. The staff are very professional and welcoming, the bedrooms (and bathrooms) are unique, beautifully furnished and very spacious. My husband and I got married here during the summer of 2014; we and our guests were completely blown away by the setting and the high standards set by this remarkable hotel. We would highly recommend it as a wedding venue or as a special 'get away' treat. You won't be disappointed! "
4;My husband and I visited on armistice weekend 11/ to 13th Nov It was a very busy weekend. There was a bit of a wait at reception to check in, due to the very attentive, pleasant, receptionists attention to detail. Well worth the delay to be treated with such friendly courteousness. We were given a much appreciated upgraded room and enjoyed a very pleasant two night stay. The bed was really confatable and the room very pleasant with controllable heating and air con. The self service breakfast included in the price we paid, was good with plenty of choice, tea or coffee was served at the table. Very good position opposite Hyde park,short walk across the park to Royal Albert Hall and Museums. Staff at hotel were all friendly and courteous. My only niggle was a lift out of order made the wait for lifts at busy times too long.
4; Excellent accomodation and location. Very friendly staff. I will reccomend it. It is conveniently located considering that the Gatwick Express doesn't run all night and a taxi can be more expensive. The quality of the bed is fantastic and the service is very good. 
4; Wow is the best way to sum this stunning hotel . In fact I am tempted not to tell anyone as to keep it a secret . A 17th century house which has added some upto date facilities . We had the Thermal spa experience , I have never had such a view whilst sitting in a sauna .what we liked they keep it to a few people at a time so very intimate no fighting for beds. It hosts weddings and we can see why it's popular. From the drive up , to the entrance all the finishing touches. On our second day we had treatments , we have done a few spas and this was very professional, a lovely seating area while you wait , heated treatment beds . The best changing rooms so far I have been in . Leather chairs . Will definitely returned . It was well the 2 hour drive 
4; Thank you to all at Losehill House Hotel & Spa. We stayed at the weekend on an inclusive package and can only complement all of you on your professionalism, friendliness and efficiency.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome, and nothing was too much trouble.  The spa treatments we both had were fantastic. These were a first for my husband and he felt thoroughly pampered. All the staff in the spa were very friendly and knowledgeable.  The room was amazing, and the cafetiere of coffee and the locally bottled water a really nice touch.  The food - all I can say is Wow! It was exceptional and can understand the well deserved commendations and awards.   Would I recommend to a friend .... definitely, would I return .... without a doubt.  If you're contemplating visiting and are looking for a relaxing peaceful break, you won't be disappointed. 
4; Very enjoyable 2 night stay for a wedding. From the minute we arrived the staff did everything they could to make our visit go smoothly. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The wedding breakfast was excellent and the hotel staff and venue made it a day to remember. Would certainly recommend for anyone looking for a wedding reception venue or just a chill out weekend. 
4; This was our third visit to Tylney Hall All the staff recognise us, and the warmth of the team is all part of the great experience and the reason we return. Our room was exquisite, overlooking the parkland We were wonderfully comfortable. We ate in the Oak Room restaurant two nights and enjoyed first class food and service. We also had a meal served by room service which was lovely. As the weather was not great we just sat in front of the large fire in the lounge, relaxing and enjoyed being looked after. We have travelled worldwide and this hotel is one of the best in the UK. 
4; We have stayed here four times during our daughter's time at university and always experienced a very warm hospitable and welcoming attitude from all members of staff The rooms are very comfortable and individual but all are lovely whether in the olf house or the new wing. Thank you for yet another enjoyable visit - we are hoping, despite being here for graduation, it will not be our last stay! 
4; I stayed at this hotel on 13th July, having travelled to London for shopping and the Rolling Stones Concert at Hyde Park. I was delighted with room with separate coffee area. It was exactly like the brochure! The bed was lovely, so soft and comfortable, the bathroom was a dream - all in marble, and the wide screen TV a bonus. Breakfast at the glass fronted veranda was delicious. Katrina at Reception was so helpful and genuinely helpful. I will definitely be back..... 
4; My fiancé and I have just arrived home from a wonderful weekend break at Durham castle. The situation of the castle is absolutely breathtaking and the views from our window were staggering. The reception staff were all eager to help and very friendly and the breakfast offerings were brilliant (including a vegetarian option for myself) We stayed in a double en suite room at the very top of the castle keep and whilst there were a LOT of stairs to get there the view more than compensated for it. I would highly recommend the castle hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Durham and will definitely be making the trip back myself in the near future. 
4; Our wedding breakfast and evening reception were held at Crewe Hall on Thursday 27th December 2012. The day flowed beautifully, even after we and most of our guests were nearly an hour late arriving due to an accident on the M6 motorway. This didn't faze the staff at all, they clearly anticipated our arrival with champagne and snow machine ready as we pulled up to the front of the building. The place looked fantastic, we have had endless comments about the quality of the food and the excellent service of the staff. Lucy and Andrew work tirelessly to ensure the day is everything you have dreamed of and we were so happy that we chose Crewe Hall. Our room was beautiful, the spa facilities are brilliant and everyone had a fantastic time. I have been to many weddings at various venues and the key to a great wedding is the smoothness with which it is managed at your reception venue. Crewe Hall have it down to a fine art, we wanted for nothing. Thank you to all the staff who worked so hard to make our day everything we wanted, we can't wait to return for our first anniversary! 
4;This hotel is situated just 2 minutes walk from the tube station. The staff were very attentive and extremely friendly. The room was of great standard and lovely touches as always. Woud I stay here again, yes I would.
4; Very friendly place. Spotlessly clean with very helpful staff. The entertainments team are brilliant and always cheerful. Personally I prefer the tribute weekends as the entertainments team seem to repeat their performances which are brilliant (don't get me wrong) but once you've seen them and all that. Have stayed in the top two accommodations which are both equally great! The food is also very good and they have efficient staff. Location good as you are not far from Gun Wharf Quays and Chichester which is a beautiful place. The cathedral is well worth a visit. 
4; Having just got back from another lovely experience at the Gonville in Cambridge, I can really recommend this hotel. Not only is it in a fabulous location in the centre of Cambridge opposite Parker's Piece, the staff are always so friendly and can't do enough to help. Ibrahim has been there as long as I have been visiting Cambridge for work and he is friendly and takes time out to talk with you. A particular favourite is the garden at the back of the hotel where you can relax after a hard day at work and drink a glass of chilled Sauvignon or two and none of the staff forget that you are there. It is a truly lovely experience. 
4; Fab room,good location,great breakfast,-would stay again-no problems-nice pool area-changing rooms a bit small but that wasn't a problem-Used shuttle bus into heathrow airport to go into london and that was easy too.we have stayed in many in this area for trips into london and this was definately the better 
4; we visited on 11th Feb 2014 and thoroughly enjoyed our evening. The atmosphere was good and staff were friendly and helpful. The only down side was that two of us had fillet and they were not cooked quite as we had asked we suspect they had been put under heat lamps to keep warm as half of each of our steaks was over cooked, another of us asked for chateaubriand cooked medium and it came rare and in some parts bleu. Disappointing as we were not in the mood to send it back. Pudding - another story, the prune tart with earl grey ice cream is one of the best puddings i have had in a long time. Starters were memorable too. Just need to sort the steaks guys! 
4; Stayed here for 2 nights and it was great. Really nice size rooms with all the amenities needed. Not far from Fulham Broadway tube station and right next to Stamford bridge! Will definitely stay here again! 
4; Just spent the weekend at littlecote, first time we have been to Warners.We had a fantastic time, only had a standard room but it was bigger than we expected very clean.The staff were all friendly and worked very hard, seemed to be short on bar staff which caused a few queues.The entertainment team were very friendly and talented their show was as good as any you pay to see.We enjoyed everything this place had to offer, and will definitely be back. 
4; Lovely hotel. Clean and very well cared for . Close to town and dock but still peaceful and quiet. Staff go that extra mile for you if you need anything or information. I would definitely highly recommend this hotel. Also it is only five minutes from lime street station by taxi. Very well positioned. Am looking forward to going back in the near future. 
4; Stayed here with family when headed back to US. Hotel is beautiful and staff very helpful and professional. Very convenient to Heathrow. Rooms are soundproofed and no planes are heard. 
4; Loved the castle look of this hotel and the beautifully, designed grounds. Inside the hotel was just as nice. Very english. Room was good and loved all the little touches that this hotel offers. Enjoyed the putting green and snooker room, where u can have fun. Excellent service from staff and great breakfast. Will be coming back! 
4;We booked a night's stay at The Oaksmere to combine it with a visit to our daughter, studying at UEA (only half an hour away). We don't know the area at all and were delighted with our visit. The staff were very friendly and attentive, the food was delicious and our room was lovely. We were very impressed with the attention to detail and the level of comfort of the beds. We have read some of the reviews about the noise from the bar but can't say we had the same experience- however we were the last to leave the bar having a rare night away! We are very pleased that our daughter has another year at uni so we can have an excuse to return.
4; Me and my partner stayed at Drakes in the feature room for 1 night for his birthday. The room was absolutley amazing, so much better than we had expected. The view of the sea and pier was an absolute picture and the staff were so welcoming and friendly. Our only complaint would be the road noise at night but this can't be helped as it is a listed building and only has single glazed windows. The staff did provide us with ear plugs which helped and we got a good nights sleep in the end. The bath overlooking the sea is a real treat and we enjoyed relaxing in the bath with our prosecco and chocolates! We will definitley be looking to return in the near future. 
4; My husband and I have just returned today from a two night break at this wonderful hotel. It was my Valentine's present to him and I couldn't have chosen anywhere better. I had read a lot of reviews before we arrived and although my expectations were high they were most definitely surpassed. Every member of staff we met were so welcoming and helpful our room was beautiful, very spacious and very clean. The restaurant was brilliant being glass fronted with spectacular views. The food was by far the highlight it was first class well deserving of the awards it has received in our opinion the awards should be higher every dish we tried was excellent. Thank you so much for such a wonderful time we have both returned home relaxed something that is normally so hard to achieve I just wish we could have stayed longer. If anyone is wondering where to go for a break Soar Mill Cove Hotel is definitely the best choice 
4;Myself and 5 other family members booked in for a one night stay which included scones on arrival, a three course dinner and breakfast in the morning. From the moment we checked in we were greeted by the most professional hotel reception that I have ever encountered immediately making us all feel welcomed and looked after. Our rooms were excellent they really suited the Tudor style feel and are set in a courtyard style setting with a very pretty view of the well kept gardens. Scones were laid out for us outdoors (at our request) and were so yummy and plentiful. We relaxed in the very neat and tidy lobby area and were impressed my the attentive waiter service, one thing that you notice about this hotel is how hard working the staff are. For the evening dinner we were looked after by Annette who I believe is the assistant manager. She gave us exceptional service accommodating our food requests nothing was too much trouble, she really is a huge asset to the hotel. Our dinner was served in the lovely conservatory and was outstanding, couldn't fault anything everything was cooked fresh and had so much flavour. We retired to the hotels beautiful lounge area where we were welcome again by Annette (this lady really is SUPERWOMAN) we had waiter service by the lovely gentleman (sorry didn't get his name) he too is an extremely hard worker as he was serving us till very late and was there bright & early for breakfast. Breakfast was FANTASTIC again everything was just superb and we had the pleasure of seeing the Tudor dining room in all it's glory. An amazingly room to be in. We recommend Marygreen Manor and thank Annette and her team for providing us with extra special service in what is becoming a very 'inpersonal world' Thank you x
4; I just want to say a massive thank you to the staff at Crown Plaza Battersea. I stayed at the hotel on Saturday 7th feb for my Boyfriends birthday and they made sure that everything was perfect for us. When we arrived they took our bags in and took the cars keys and went to park our car. The room was amazing, we stayed in room 202. It had a river view and we also had the helipad view so we often saw the helicopters coming and going. The room was so big and it was lovely and clean. My favourite bit was the bathroom, it was so spacious and I loved it! The TV in the bathroom did not work though but that didn't really phase us as I had been told when I rang the other day.   We had some lovely robes in the room so we thought it would be rude not to wear them and try the spa! The spa was lovely, It smelt so good, my bf loved the hydro pool, I had trouble getting out!. There were a few people down at the spa but it still was fine. One of the small things that I really appreciated was that there were jugs of cold. icy lemon water everywhere - around the spa, in the dining area and in the bar, even in the room!!! nice!  We planned to go to the spa again in the morning but the bed was so massive and comfy, we couldn't even get out of bed. We ended up having to because we had the lovely breakfast waiting. We went down around 10am and there were still serving! I love my food hot and it was! The plates were warm and they kept refilling all the dishes so we never had to wait around for food! It tasted really nice and there was a wide range of food to choose from both hot and cold.   We were having dinner at a neighbouring hotel so we asked for directions at the reception and there were so helpful. I was so pleased with the way the staff was so happy to help and they were going out of their way to make sure we were ok. We even asked to check out late and they allowed us to and after we checked out we went for drinks in the bar and the staff were nice enough to get the car, help with our bags and to arrange a lift for my BF.  One big mistake I made was booking through one of these third party companies, I thought I was getting a bargain but I actually ended up paying more. do it direct with the hotel!  Amazing!!! Amazing!! Amazing!!! We are looking at our dates so we can book again!!! Everyone at work is tired of hearing how amazing this hotel is!! 
4; Beautiful hotel, staff were very nice and helpful! Room was lovely, very spacious, bed was so comfortable. Bathroom very nice and facilities very good. Free water in room very welcomed.amazing views of St pancreas, kings cross. Five minutes walk from Euston. Very close to tubes. Breakfast was very reasonable.12 pound each but you could pick multiple things off menu like home made granola, full English, unlimited drinks very fresh. Cannot fault this hotel at all just wish I could have stayed longer 
4;This weekend my Sister and myself came to london as a birthday treat for her to see a show etc. The Hotel staff did all they could to make her stay memorable, they gave us a bottle of prosecco and a plate of cakes decorated with happy birthday iced on to the plate. The whole hotel was lovely we even had time for dip in the pool.Food reasonably priced and presented beautifully. All in all a lovely weekend.
4;"INCREDIBLE is the only way to describe our wedding day at the Wood Norton - we got married on the 27/08/16 and our feet still haven't touched the ground; our day was just perfect. We booked the Wood Norton back in 2015 and our experience in the run up to our wedding was fantastic, the team were always so welcoming and always willing to go above and beyond to answer our questions or show us around. Aside from the absolutely stunning venue and scenery which speaks for itself; we couldn't speak more highly of Sandie, Andrea, Josh and the whole team who helped to make our day so special; in particular Sandie who is just a treasure and has been there for us right from the beginning. Sandie and the team helped us to create the day we had imagined and ensured that it was all about us - nothing was too much trouble and this included helping me with the train on my dress/carrying my bouquet/ensuring I didn't get wet in the rain when we were getting pictures. They brought to life exactly what we had hoped for and more - so much so, the Orangery brought me to tears when I first saw it decorated for our wedding. They helped us to have the most perfect wedding day and create memories that we will treasure forever. Thank you to everyone involved - you're all absolutely fantastic and we can't wait to come and visit again!"
4; Great location in Soho and a perfect hotel if you are looking for peace, quiet and luxurious comfort with a very friendly and attentive service. Possibly the loveliest place I have stayed in a long time! 
4; Spent a very pleasant weekend as part of a group so we had a very good deal. We have spent a number of years visiting the hotel and have had excellent rooms with lovely views. The staff were exceptionally pleasant. It was particularly noticeable during breakfast and our evening meals when the serving staff went out of their way to be helpful. The restaurant manager Josef was concerned to see that everyone was happy. 
4; We recently got married at The Midland and can I just say that it was fantastic, amazing, wonderful weekend. We checked in with no problems the night before the wedding, the staff were very welcoming. As we were getting married there, we were allocated a suite which had fantastic views across St Peters Square. The room was perfect - light and spacious with good factilities for the duration of our stay. The following day from beginning to end nothing was too much trouble. Staff were brilliant throughout the wedding. The food was exceptional (I know we are biased) but we also had breakfast the following morning in Mr Coopers which was as good. We had fantastic weekend and would recommend this hotel for a wedding or stay (I have stayed here in a double room which was of a high standard).   Overall cannot fault the hotel, the staff or the services that they provide. 
4; We really enjoyed our stay at the Hermitage. We had a really superb breakfast and dinner all the staff we met were friendly and helpful. Very convenient for the BIC and Pavillion Theatre and just a short plesant walk through the Winter Gardens to the great shops. We did all our Christmas shopping!! We have booked to return twice in 2014. 
4; I booked a reasonably pricey night at the regency hotel to get away from work and have a change of scenery and I was very pleasantly surprised. Easy and free parking, good service at the desks and a spacious, warm and open room. It was a perfect place for me to breathe and have some space as a solo guest. The pool was delightful and refreshing with guests from the hotel and also paying members of the spa and gym. But all aside - The food was GLORIOUS. I had an amazing 3 course meal. I'll be going again ... 
4; Booked the Regency for a party had wonderful time,the staff were very friendly and went over and beyond to ensure that everything was perfect,food was very very good,Breakfast the following morning was also excellent and plenty of it(even though the hotel was very busy)would definitely recommend 
4;We stayed at the hotel on November 26th for my 30th Birthday. We were checked in quickly and with a warm welcome from the reception staff. The hotel is beautiful. The room was amazing, absolutely HUGE and a very big comfortable bed.  The deal we had included a 3 course evening meal and the food was first class. A great menu, Venison to start, duck for main. One of the best meals we have ever had. Our server Julee was lovely, very happy and friendly and tended to our every need.   A special mention also the young receptionist on that night (sorry I didn't get her name). I'd left my contact lens solution at home and she went and found a bottle of saline solution for me. Above and beyond.  Your staff are an absolute credit to your hotel. Everyone from the reception staff, to the bar staff, to the servers, were friendly welcoming and happy. I would give them an 11 out of 10! Keep hold of them!
4;" I regularly stay at this hotel for business and it is always my number one choice in Sheffield. The rooms are modern and very comfortable and relaxing (beds are extremely good). I did once experience a bad night; that was because the people in the adjoining room were partying in the early hours. I now request non-adjoining rooms and haven't been disturbed since. Some windows don't open, not really an issue with air con, but some people prefer fresh air.  The service is generally excellent, with helpful staff on reception and serving at the bar. I always eat in the bar rather than the restaurant as I don't find the restaurant menu that appealling (it's quite fancy/pricey and I generally prefer something simpler). The bar menu is pretty good (recently been updated), although there aren't many healthy options (heavily features chips/pie/etc). The food is always excellent though - even if not too good for the waistline! Room service is also available. Breakfasts are fab and there is a very wide range of choices to suit everyone (best scrambled egg in my experience!).  Free onsite parking is a bonus and the hotel is centrally located. There is also free wifi in the public areas, which usually works pretty well. Overall, it's a very comfortable, clean and friendly place to stay. As a regular guest, I always feel welcome and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Sheffield on business. "
4;Was very surprised at the high standard of accommodation at this hotel we had been there before for a drink and thought it was just a nice typical country pub but there is a lot more to see and enjoy. Will definitely stay there again!
4; We have just returned from a fantastic stay in the hotel. The evening meal and breakfast was excellent (You could even request breakfast in bed). I had scollops to start followed by a tasy duck dish. The meal was one of the best I had had. The hotel staff were very friendly and efficient and the room was spotless. I would recommend this hotel. Thank you for an excellent stay. 
4; My mother and I chose to book the executive room with a balcony, it is really worth the upgrade. This included free breakfast down in the windows restaurant (which was extremely good) and access to the executive suite where they also provided breakfast, tea and cake (scones) in the afternoon and canopies in the evening with a choice drinks, not to mention the window view !  Spa was very clean, the only thing I would say is bring your towels down from your room and ask for fresh afterwards as the spa does not provide them.  Would 100% stay here again, with family, as a couple or with friends. 
4; We were staying in Portscatho but came across to St Mawes for the day and decided on Hotel Tresanton for lunch. They were very accommodating even with 3 young children (9, 5, and 2). We were put slightly away from other diners on raised platform, which was perfect. Nice large round table as well as sun beds that boys lounged on between courses. Also borrowed some toys from playroom to keep them quiet. Staff were very attentive. During a brief rain shower they were very quick to bring out more umbrellas. Children's food was lovely and just as good quality as adult's with good size portions. A very pleasant way to while away a couple of hours of our holiday in the sunshine. 
4; Such a lovely place to stay.beautiful country side and setting.Warners do it so well,they cater for most peoples tastes.Do as much or as little as you want.The staff are all well informed as to what is going on and they make you feel so special,nothing is too much for them and they work well as a team.The food is delicious and well served,either it be a selection from the carvery or something from the kitchen menu.We ate in the Granary restaurant and felt we were in a very select few.Quieter and nearer our room too.Entertainment is first class,the resident team are so talented,while you are there you feel like a little family.The rooms are serviced every day and kept really well and our bed was huge.Our room looked out on to a walled garden with spring flowers,so nice.Not far from the sea at Lyme bay if you want a ride out too. 
4; This hotel has an excellent location. The service is outstanding and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The facilities are very good too. the breakfast offers a wide variety of lovely fresh home made products and delicious coffee. I would recommend it to anyone visiting London. 
4; I came here with my boyfriend on Friday 21st March 2014, we was going to a concert at the NIA. This hotel was perfect for location, the NIA was a 5 min walk, and Brindley place was round the corner as was mailbox. You are also on Broad Street. Nandos, spar, McDonalds, Greggs etc literally 2 minutes away. We stayed on the 6th floor and had a great view. Always loads of staff around. It’s defiantly the cleanest, modern and most suitable hotel I’ve stopped in. The beds are comfy and the bathroom was gorgeous. I would advise anyone to stop here its really nice  
4;I booked a two week stay in this hotel as it was centrally situated for me to get to Yeovil and Sidmouth for business/pleasure. I travel with my disabled son and a full time carer. When I originally read the reviews, I was a bit skeptical but managed to get a good price for the two rooms and so went ahead with the booking.  My son and I had the accessible room which was lovely and bright in yellow and blue and very roomy. The shower was completely accessible with good pressure and hot water. Could have done with a bit bigger bedside cupboard to store all the meds!! His carer had the next room round the corner which was another very nice room in green and red. The accessible room was right next to the lift on the first floor.  The staff were an absolute pleasure from the General Manager down. The GM welcomed me on arrival, and reiterated what he had said on the phone, basically my wish was their command. The reception staff were friendly, competent and followed up on matters. I was promised a disabled parking bay right outside the hotel which I got initially, but which was then abused by other Christmas revellers who should not have parked there. After that, the duty manager would park his car in the bay while I was out, and would move the vehicle when I returned, thus ensuring a parking space for me all the time.  The breakfast was excellent and all that anybody could want for. Some days my sons carer just brought us fruit to the room, on a few days, we went for the full breakfast. We also got snowed in so did have a meal in the hotel one evening which was very nice. The staff had gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that residents could eat in the hotel, even though their staff numbers were radically reduced due to the adverse weather conditions.  We had our two little dogs with us as well and on three occasions, a member of staff actually accompanied my son on the daily walk with the dogs, after the carer had gone away for a couple of days. I am not joking, nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  It was over Christmas and the hotel was very busy with parties and festivities. My son joined in one party and was welcomed by the hosts who had provided a band (he loves dancing), and the band ended up playing all his choices to which everybody danced. He was made to feel so welcome.  The location of the hotel is absolutely brilliant. It is 200 yards away from the shopping centre, and within easy driving distance of both the M5 and the A30.  I cannot praise the GM and his staff enough. What was booked as an ordinary holiday so that we could visit family in devon and friends in Somerset, turned out to be a magical experience. I would definitely go back there, and I would also recommend it to a friend.  Thank you Mark and all your staff for a wonderful experience.
4;After staying in corporate hotels in Leeds and commuting to Halifax, Holdsworth is quite literally a breath of fresh air. Great for business trip but made it feel like being on holiday! Super-comfortable beds, good tea with a tea pot and a proper size kettle, fabulous food, reasonable prices, beautiful grounds.
4; Relaxing one night stay, wonderful sea view from the suite, Very friendly extremely helpful staff. The food was excellent with succulent steaks, scallops and the unexpected complimentary cream teas were a nice touch so we needed the invigorating sea cliff walks and spa treatments. The Lounge is light and airy yet homely and relaxing. As we found that the hotel is “dog friendly” we look forward to staying again this time with our dogs. 
4; We stayed here for a night. The hotel is great. We stayed in a silver room which was fairly basic but clean. The food served in the restaurant was lovely. The staff are attentive without being in your face and solve any problems quietly even those of a particularly fussy guest (not me!). I would recommend this hotel 
4;" We have stayed here before and decided to return; our second visit was over the weekend Saturday 1st to Sunday 2nd November.   On arrival we were greeted by a pleasant young lady who was informative and helpful. We upgraded to a feature suite so our room this time was room 19 the 'Mary Smith Suite' we found it very quaint and olde worlde full of many original features however; preferred room 20 'The Massey' we had previously stayed in as the layout was nicer.  We had dinner in the restaurant the food was lovely, staff very smily and helpful, our waiter was Riva a young chap who we found to be funny and attentive; after dinner we sat in the lounge where Riva was kind enough to bring through the remainder of our bottle of wine.  Bed very comfortable we got a great nights sleep; we loved the ambiance, stairway and look of the older front aspect of the hotel but felt the newer rear section was very '70s  The late check out was perfect. Breakfast is buffet style here the the staff were attentive however; a charity ball on the Saturday meant the breakfast room was full which lead to us not getting tea served until we'd almost finished our breakfast.  We rounded off our weekend by walking into the town and managed to do all of our Christmas shopping in one hit.  Definitely be returning, see you all next year. "
4;We were upgraded to a sea view which was glorious. Lovely spa and the décor throughout the hotel was just to my taste - simple and typically Cornwall. We took a stroll to the beach directly in front of the hotel Gyllyngvase Beach and the cliff top walk to Swanpool beach. A walk to town would be about 15 mins, although we took the car. We ate at the restaurant on one evening - they didn't have my first choice but the meal was very tasty. All staff were friendly and polite, and we would definitely go back.
4; This is a very special place to stay, a warm welcome, upgraded room, Birthday chocolates & card along with excellent food & service, what more would anyone want, my Birthday couldn't have been any better. Thank You 
4; We have visited the Millers Hotel for a meal several times and have never been disappointed. The bar/dining area is lovely, the staff are friendly and the service is excellent. The choice on the menu is varied and has good vegetarian options. This time I had the honey roasted fig and mozzarella salad which was lovely and fresh and far more filling than it first appeared. Of the other members of our group two had the steak and ale pie and one the scampi and all were very impressed. I can't comment on the hotel side as we only visited for food but if it is as good as the bar/dining I am sure it would be great. 
4; I stay here probably once a month due to business. It is a really nice hotel and very impressive looking. The Rooms have always been clean and feel spacious. I have never had a bad experience with regards to eating at this hotel, whether it be room service or eating in the restaurant - the food is gorgeous. 
4;" Booked this Hotel for my Husbands birthday, and we were not disappointed.   The Hotel is a little out of the way, but we didn't mind that at all. Arrived at the Hotel and checked in with Ease. Lovely staff, I asked lots of questions and was probably very annoying (!!) Man behind the counter simply said &quot;That's what I'm here for&quot;. Got to our room, and was spacious, fresh, clean, comfortable. Bathroom was lovely. Huge floor to ceiling windows allow lots of light.  We had drinks in the bar - the cosmopolitans are the best I've had - Kudos to the barman! (Youngish guy with blonde hair).  The restaurant team are so attentive and make you feel like you're royalty! The food was amazing. We couldn't actually manage our desserts - so instead, the Manageress handed us two complimentary drinks vouchers.  Breakfast was lovely and plentiful - everything you would imagine being at a buffet was present, which I love!! The Manager in the restaurant at breakfast was friendly, chatty and attentive - getting us our drinks and taking time to chat to us about the half Marathon that was happening that day. Swam in the pool which was warm and clean. My husband tried out the Sauna and Steam Room which he enjoyed. It's not a huge pool but it's big enough for some good lengths. Plenty of Hairdryers in front of the mirrors aswell which is always a bonus! Overall I know that when I stay in Reading again, I will stay here without a second thought. The Hotel is lovely, and the staff are absolutely fantastic. "
4; We picked up this deal via Travelzoo for a short break,and were very impressed with the hotel.Not only were the staff very polite,the food and service excellent,but all the little things had been carefully thought about to make you feel comfortable and at home. The decor was very classy,rooms very clean,little extras,bottled water,lovely biscuits,iron and ironing board,music system,free wi-fi. Excellent stay. 
4; I have just returned home from a weekend stay in Kensington House apartments with my 3 friends. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, the service we received was outstanding. Reception staff were friendly and offered to hold our bags in the reception area on both arrival and departure due to our flight times not corresponding with check in and check out times. The apartments were spotlessly clean and very modern. Every morning the housekeeping staff called and were extremely friendly and helpful. Location of apartments made getting into the city very easy. I would highly recommend staying in these apartments if visiting Newcastle. I cannot wait to return. 
4;Had a stunning penthouse which never fails to amaze. But what really made the stay was incredible food at the restaurant - fresh ingredients, aplenty, attentive service and the most reasonable pricing. Faultless!!!  Go for a steak, people, you won't regret it - and I'm a steak eater that had been spoilt from west coast and mid-west through east coast of US and most regular trips to France... Yet steak here, right by London Waterloo really blew me away!!  I'm definitely coming back soon, have to find an excuse to... Put the grill on, chef!!
4; Excellent room with comfy beds and great shower. All very clean and decor still looks fresh and well maintained. Room was very quiet at night. Also shared a twin room with a work colleague which worked well as there was plenty of space. Would recommend and only 3 mins walk from Earls Court tube station. 
4; Stayed from 24th-27th May! Fabulous location...so easy to get to from Kings Cross and easy to get to Central London too. Room was great and used the pool every morning, which was a real treat. Staff, including housekeeping were friendly and professional. Didn't use the bar or restaurant as currently on Slimming World plan but Tesco just down the road so lots of options if you are watching your weight or the pennies! The only comment I have to make is that if you have booked & paid for your hotel 7 months in advance, you should expect to arrive and have no problems with the room allocated. This isn't a complaint, just a comment. Would definitely stay in this hotel again! 
4; Brilliant hotel - stayed on 5th floor and was amazing had a great view and a balcony - Our stay was fantastic and as a Beatle fan was great to have the Cavern in the next road. The food and wine wwere excellent and service second to none the staff couldnt be more helpful. Had a private cab trip to see how the Beatles started - their homes and places of birth - Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields and the cabbie was fantastic very informative - all arranged by the hotel staff - Cannot fault this place will definately going back for a second visit. 
4; This hotel is really, really nice! My friend and myself were booked for 2 nights. The rooms are clean and really nice. Breakfast was tasty and diverse. Can't fault a Hilton breakfast buffet anywhere you would go.  I would like to mention Aga (the breakfast supervisor) who was nice and approachable, chef who approved to have a takeaway breakfast in our second morning. We had a very early flight to catch. As well, Laszlo was great! He was very friendly, nice and professional.  We are definitely coming back!!! 
4; When you go to Blackpool there could be doubt in your booking but no worries here, Aaron & Jane,Chris & staff made our NewYear bash most enjoyable, Entertainment good, Food fantastic ,cosy beds.Lots of laughs,  It was like a big house party with all guests enjoying themselves to the full. Nice to see Jane, the owner putting so much love in her job making perfection everytime. Many Thanks, 
4; Had a lovely stay at the Hilton Northampton where we went for a family night away. Rooms were immaculate and staff were very friendly and helpful - a very welcoming hotel.  Also enjoyed a lovely meal in the restaurant on site. Would 100% recommend. 
4; Stayed for 2 nights whilst on business. The staff are the hotels best asset - all were extremely helpful and friendly, a credit to the Hotel.   Great location in central Manchester. Room was very comfortable, breakfast good - I was disappointed not to have time to use all the faciltilies.  Highly recommend 
4; this spa hotel is on the welsh boarder the spa here is one of the best i have used . fantastic treatment rooms, wheelpool huge ,the swimming pool was closed for referb so cannnot coment on this area ,all. staff pleasent, helpfull ,the after noon tea was much better than expected good selection of sandwiches ,cakes a high tea really ,,i was shown all areas on arrival thought all staff happy ,to help nothing was too much trouble , for them they just wanted to give you a good visit , i will use this spa again ,would like more offers here but it was a hit with me ,a real treat 
4; Attended hotel for company conference. Stunning location and amazing rooms. Stopped in a very spacious Room 2 with views over the lake. Been to conferences here twice now but first stop over I would high recommend staying 
4; Stayed for 2 nights with husband, daughter and 3 grandsons. Reception very efficient and professional. Also we needed an extra bed in room, our error, and it was dealt with very quickly. Breakfast great on both mornings, had freshly cooked haddock and poached egg, lovely.... Staff friendly and great with the kids Went swimming and water was perfect temperature for the kids, especially the baby. Kids thoroughly enjoyed. Checkout was easy, bill correct.  Overall great experience and will return 
4;We use Judges for both personal and business events, meetings and social occasions  The food and service are constantly to a high standard and I would always recommend this beautiful country house for all occasions
4; Another fantastic holiday there was 37 of us it was a residential holiday we had silver bungalow and premium dining can't fault the food or staff the park was brilliant been going for about 15yrs. Got a family break in September and another in October so good keep going back to much to do great value for money 
4;Love this place! Beautiful hotel, very good value for money, good sized rooms, very clean and well presented, lovely ambiance, very helpful staff, useful location for business or pleasure, will most definitely be back. Next time in London
4; I have frequented Eastwell Manor on and off for years as a weekend retreat, beauty treatments, bar and restaurant visits.  Eastwell Manor has had its ups and downs through the years and is perhaps a little dated in the dining room. But, it's one of my favorites, especially over Christmas time when the nostalgia of the building is at its best.  I went for lunch with a friend and it didn't disappoint the food was superb the staff attentive and the atmosphere was wonderful. I will visit again very soon. 
4; We are so happy that we have returned to the Summer Lodge this August. Terrible weather meant that we were forced to relax at the hotel and make use of the spa and bar…. It’s a hard life! It really feels like coming home. The staff are so kind and attentive. Our Labrador, Jessie, even got a sausage of her own for breakfast!! I hasten to add, that if you wish to dine with your canine companion, then a table is set up in the bar for you, where dogs are permitted. Nothing is too much trouble here. There is no compromise on style, service or the food. I can’t think of many places where one can enjoy a fine dining experience with their dog at their feet. Summer Lodge is such a special place, we feel so lucky to stay here, and we hate to leave! To all of you who take so much time to make our stay extra special, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. See you VERY soon I hope. 
4; I stayed at the hotel for one evening. The hotel room was very clean and the view was great!! All staff at the hotel were friendly and they was always willing to help! We also ate at the hotels restaurant, which again was lovely. My overall stay at the hotel was fantastic and I recommend anyone booking this hotel. The atmosphere was relaxed and all staff were polite and always there to help. 
4; Stayed two nights on a visit to Sheffield. Clean large room shower and bathing an executive room. Helpful, friendly staff. A short walk from city near Victoria docks. Ideal for quieter stay out of city. 
4;My husband and I love to stay at the Raddison Blu before a trip away.  Check in is quick and easy, rooms are spotlessly clean and lovely decorated.  Ask for a runway view at check in if they have one available they will give you one.  This time we upgraded to a business class room with lounge access as an anniversary treat. It was lovely, the lounge is nice with alcoholic drinks and canapés included between 5pm-9pm. We ate in the restaurant after going to the lounge and the food was as always brilliant if slightly overpriced.  Love the hotel bar and it's cocktails menu!  The beds in the hotel are so comfy. The only down side is that the pillows are rubbish they are so soft your head sinks into them and you can hardly see because it puffs up either side of your face! As soon as we arrive we just ring reception and ask for more firm pillows. They are still very soft so we just end up with 3 each which seems to work.  We had breakfast brought to our room the next morning which was nice this comes at an extra charge of £4 per tray which the hotel forgot to charge at check out. Breakfast it ordered by a ticket in your room then hanging it on your door.  The hotel is situated between T1 and T2 you just walk out of the front door and jump on the escalator and it takes you straight there.  Can't wait for our next stay at the Raddiosn Blu
4; What a sublime lunch we had at the South Sands on Friday. Nothing was too much trouble and the first class food, wine and beach side location made this visit an absolute no brainer. Our table of 17 was extremely well looked after by the whole team of professional and very friendly staff. I highly recommend this establishment to everyone locally and further afield. With or without children! 
4;My husband is in poor health and not very mobile. We needed a hotel over Christmas in order to attend services at Westminster Abbey where our grandson is a chorister. This hotel was within easy walking distance of the Abbey and our daughter's house.
4; We stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed every second, delicious food, friendly staff (great instructors and therapists) the grounds are beautiful. We had a lovely room which I understand was recently refurbished. Thank you very much for a wonderful stay, we'll definitely be back. 
4; An excellent very comfortable room,wonderful pillows and superb bathroom.Great tea /coffee making facilities.Very friendly helpful staff.Good breakfast choice but could have been a bit hotter,but generally very good.Would come here again. 
4; Stayed for one night with a spa inclusive package, dinner and wine included. Cannot fault anything about my stay: great service, very new and clean facilities, dinner was great. All in all a fantastic value for money! 
4; This was a two day break for my birthday,and my husband had never been to Stratford before so we wanted a hotel in the centre of things so everything was in short walking distance. This fitted the bill perfectly.The building was impressive and reception was tastefully welcoming and comfortable.We couldnt wait to see our room,as the whole place was so lovely.We couldnt afford one of the themed rooms in the origonal part of the building but what we had was so perfect the others must be breathtaking! The wow factor is what we got,from the oak wooden floor to the furniture in keeping with the theme of this room in a lime washed oak. It was not cluttered with pictures or vases but the decor was so tastefull those things were not needed. The room had all mod cons from a home hub in the wall to a iron and board,hairdlryer,fridge with complimentry water,mini cans of coke and orange,all descretly hidden away in the furniture. The bathroom was luxury with a big deep claw foot bath as well as a double shower,and  big fluffy towels and robes. The bar and restaurent had old world charm,the food well presented and tasty...but although all the staff were helpful one shone out and her name Sarah Jane....she was helpful,happy and smiling,knowledgeable about the history of the building but without being prompted by my husband on the night of my birthday,we had enjoyed a fab meal and she brought out a desert with candles on for my birthday. We mentioned it was a birthday treat when we arrived and she made a mental note of this. The whole experience was wonderful but its the little things that mean so much and the hotel is lucky to have her.Best hotel we have stayed in and will be going back. 
4; We stayed here for a valentine weekend and there was something we had planned to do in Stratford. The hotel was very easy to find, the grounds were amazing and well kept. As soon as we arrived we headed to the spa as we were booked in for a massage and lunch. The spa staff took time to show us around the spa and its facilities and then offered us a drink while we waiting for our massage (we was slightly early). We had our massage together, it was very relaxing and the girls were very professional and made my partner and I feel totally relaxed.   After the massage we made use of the other spa facilities, the pool and jacuzzi was lovely and warm and most of all clean. They had a sauna and a steam room too which we sat for a while before going in to the outdoor pool. I was not keen on going out there as it was cold but I'm glad i went out there with my husband, it was so nice and warm too - the jets were lovely and powerful too!   The menu at the spa had a lot of choice and it all looked nice. We went for a platter with seafood on it and we had no complaints!   We checked in to our room at 2pm. The hotel has an amazing, beautiful feeling about it when you walk in, Our room was easy to find and we were very pleased with it. It was immaculate and we had a beautiful view out of the window. One night we came back to the hotel about 10:30 and stayed in the main lounge area next to the log fire and sat there till the early hours drinking and talking to my partner. The staff were very attentive, the bar staff they told me to take a seat and they would bring my drinks over. The breakfast staff were just as attentive, making sure everybody had enough tea/coffee and making sure breakfast was not running out.  I had an amazing stay and would recommend to anybody who is considering booking. 
4; Only stayed here for one night during our trip to London August 2011. We chose this hotel because of its closeness to Drury Lane as we had pre-booked tickets to a show. The hotel is no more than 5 minutes walk away from Covent Gardens and 10 minutes walk to Leicester Square. We walked to Drury Lane to see our show within 5 minutes. The hotel is very clean and the staff well attentive. We were originally given rooms at the front of the hotel overlooking the road, but noticed a couple of pubs opposite which were creating some afternoon noise. Asked at reception about moving to the rear of the hotel (admittedly no nice view, but preferred to sleep as opposed to people watch) and they moved us with no problems. Slept like a baby. Huge beds, spotless linen, tea/coffee making facilities in room and bathroom very clean.  Would not hesitate to recommend or stay there again. 
4;Lovely hotel, clean, friendly and good food. Lovely room. Friendly and helpful reception staff. Service in dining room a bit slow but supervisor doing her best to hurry the waiting staff along. Two lamps out in my room, so quite dark, but too tired to report at time. Altogether nice, I would stay there again.
4; My usual method of choosing a hotel is first to decide where to go and then look at the reviews on Trip Advisor and before making a final choice. However , my latest weekend away was different. I was contacted by Leisure Hotels, which I had used last year, and was offered their Great British Break Off. Who would not be tempted by a room for 2 nights with a bonus of 2 three course meals for free and a bottle of Prosecco? We arrived late on Friday just in time for our delicious free meal and in the morning we opened the curtains of our room to have the marvellous view of the riverside garden, the meadows with grazing sheep and Salisbury Cathedral. The breakfast was excellent with a wide choice and having your food cooked to order means it is piping hot on arrival and hasn’t been kept warm for hours. What can be better than to eat breakfast overlooking the river Avon watching the swans swimming by. Being a short walk from the cathedral and the city centre shops is an added bonus and makes the Rose and Crown the ideal hotel to choose when visiting Salisbury. 
4; My boyfriend booked the hotel for me as a surprise for my birthday and from the moment we arrived, which was through the wrong entrance, we were immediately welcomed by nice and courteous staff that showed us to the correct reception. Once we had been checked in and shown to our rooms we were pleasantly surprised by our room and the view we had. My boyfriend had paid for a superior room with balcony and sea view and that is what we had and it's was beautiful. Not to mention the bathroom was huge! We booked a table when we checked in and every aspect of the meal was perfect from the bar staff to the food. Each meal came quickly and was perfect quality and taste. The staff couldn't do enough for us and made us feel so comfortable.   We only managed to stay for one night due to my boyfriends work commitments but have already said we will be back for a longer weekend or trip so we can really enjoy everything the hotel has to offer as it was a perfect night for both of us. 
4; We had a really lovely evening at Henlow spa. The pool and spa were fab - we had a great environment to relax and chat. Dinner was really tasty and the staff were friendly and helpful. I would really recommend the spa evening as it was great value and most enjoyable. 
4; We spent an absolutely wonderful three night break at this great hotel. It is in a beautiful spot, has peaceful rooms with views that you could look at all day and an excellent restaurant that is something special to look forward to in the evening. The staff make its guests very welcome. Can't wait to go back! 
4; Very pleasantly surprised by this gem of a hotel. No sound at all from other guests, not even doors closing! Right in the city centre, so great for shopping and socialising and a short walk from the station. Would definitely stay again as didn't have time to try the spa 
4; The Connaught is an excellent hotel. The Lily Room is a spacious and comfortable room. However, it is the food in Blakes and the superb hotel and restaurant staff that keep drawing us back time and again. Nothing is too much trouble and the knowledge and experience of the maître d' adds to a wonderful dining experience. 
4; A beautiful hotel that's just a stone's throw from the British Museum, in the heart of Bloomsbury. The staff are quite possibly the best staff I have ever dealt with - polite, friendly, helpful and most importantly caring and warm, nothing is too much trouble for them. The room was small, tiny in fact, but elegantly furnished with all the extras that you would expect in a quality hotel, and a few extras, such as fresh homemade cookies delivered on the first day. My only criticism of the room is that the bathroom fittings were a little tired, but still very clean. The breakfasts were excellent and on our second day, the dining hall was full so we had our own private breakfast served in the conservatory - superb! A wonderful couple of days spent in London for our Daughter's graduation. 
4; the location is perfect, 5 minutes away from the train station, cut through the arches and hey presto you have it in your sights, throughout our stay we found it very quiet both internally and externally even though there is building work outside there are about 6 steps going up to the entrance and I did wonder how a person in a wheelchair would get in the fully fitted kitchen was exceptionally fitted out, great to have a good sized fridge in the room, bonus to have a dishwasher all the furniture was to a high standard and the chairs in the lounge were lovely and comfortable, the height of the television in the lounge was a little impractical but we just used it to look at the news and weather we loved the bedroom area and the mattress was really comfortable, I personally would have preferred thicker pillows as I like more neck support....but the decorative cushions were put into use the facilities in the bathroom were outstanding, my one criticism is the rainfall shower which wasn't very practical for anyone worried about getting their hair wet as you couldn't manoeuvre in the shower and not come out looking like a drowned rat, there was a hairdryer in the room but sometimes this gal wants to just get up and go, maybe supplying a shower cap along with the toiletries could be something to consider, but you can always venture into Poundland and get a Miss Piggy one *cough*  all in all I would heartily recommend staying here, when we booked the prices were very reasonable, can't wait to stay at this or another location again, particularly keen on the York Roomzzz when it opens 
4;Stayed at The Trout for 1 night. Cockermouth itself is a beautiful town.The hotel has been refurbished to a very high standard. Immaculate inside and out. Staff lovely and extremely helpful. Breakfast fantastic. Top marks for an enjoyable and luxurious stay.
4; Vibrant bistro/cafe located on the ground floor of the Vincent Hotel in the heart of Southport!. There's an excellent selection of freshly made authentic sushi but for the non-sushi lovers there's also a wide range of great dishes to tempt and delight. The food is consistently of a high standard, staff are very attentive without being over the top and its an ideal place to meet for lunch and dinner or just popping in for coffee with friends. Why not consider having dinner over the festive period whilst the mile long boulevard of Southport is awash with tiny white twinkling lights adorning the trees that line both sides of Lord Street - its truly magical! 
4;We celebrated our wedding at this fantastic hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. Suzanne was a fantastic help from the day of the booking to the day of the wedding. Dave was a star, happy, helpful and friendly. Our little dog took a quite a shine to him. The two lovely young ladies who served us our wedding breakfast were brilliant. We had guests staying from far and wide and everyone of them commented on what lovely service they got and how good the accommodation is. We were already aware of their planned refurbishment. Now the food, this deserve a special mention. From breakfast to room service to wedding breakfast it was absolutely superb. To Will and all the kitchen staff thank you for the wonderful food. A big thank you to all the team at The Grange for making our wedding such a memorable and special event. We will most definitely be coming back.
4; My husband booked this hotel as a surprise to celebrate my birthday. On arrival we had no trouble parking as there was ample parking. The hotel receptionist greeted us and was very helpful. The room was clean and tidy with all the usual amenities. We were surprised to see a chiller(not fridge) but it was useful for the odd purchased drink. The AC system was very easy to use to regulate the heat I the room. Our room was quiet considering the hotel was near a big busy roundabout. The bed was medium firm but comfortable and the pillows were soft. The downside to the hotel was the cost of the WiFi. We ate in the restaurant and the meals were delicious. The staff were attentive and friendly. There was a 10 min bus ride to the town centre. We would definitely stay here again when we visit Oxford. 
4; EXCELLANT HOTEL Premier room superb private balcony with views across the bay. very comfotable bed. well furnished room.bathroom very good and spotless. food both breakfast and dinner excellant. staff friendly and helpfull.. a short walk[pass the penguins] down to pritty harbour and town centre. we will return soon. 
4; We have recently returned from some night stay at the hotel. We were very impressed by the we!lcome we had at reception. We stayed in the rose suite which was so comfortable and immaculately clean .there were nice touches like the coffee machine and the bowl or caramels. The bathroom was well equipped and spacious. Very nice shower. We ate in Blake's booking is recommended and we were so pleased we prebooked.the welcome a d service throughout our meal was superb the food was hot plentiful and beautifully presented.a lovely evening which we both enjoyed. Breakfast was served in Blake's and there was a lovely choice.the food was hot and very good quality. Our only complaint was that we were only there one night.we will return and stay longer next time.well done Connaught. superb. 
4; This hotel is quite new so has a very clean, modern appearence inside as well as outside. We booked a standard twin room for a girls weekend away and we were shocked at the high standard of everything. Clean comfortable rooms with all mod cons and lovely big shower heads. The staff were so helpful and friendly, always smiling. We booked for breakfast and were glad we did as the food was delicious and there was plenty to choose from.   A two minute walk from shops, bars etc this hotel really has everything!  Only complaint would be parking, not many spaces and an extra charge of £10 per night that wasnt clearly advertised when we booked. All in all i would definately go back to this hotel and would thoroughly recommend it to everyone from girls weekends away to family trips. 
4; Stayed here on New Years Eve 2013 - New Years Day 2014 to watch the fireworks on the River Thames in London with my boyfriend. This hotel is fantastic, loved everything about it!! The staff on arrival and althroughout our stay they were completely fantastic friendly staff and very helpful. This hotel puts customers needs first, little touches like they brought bottles of water around on New Years Day (obviously to make people feel better the morning after). The Value of the hotel is great pay for what you get. The marriott beds are always out of this world, if you fall asleep you may not wake up due to being so comfortable. The hotel was very clean, everywhere we went in the hotel. We also got access to the exc lounge in the hotel which is fantastic. The rooms are a perfect size and have everything you need in them. The location is get too just 3 mins walk away from Gloucester Road tube station and opposite a Sainbury's shop. The breakfast is amazing!!! They make you what you want and you can eat as much as you like. WAFFLES AND PANCAKES!!!   Just had the most fabulous time here, it made our stay in London much better. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody who wants a lovely stay in a fantastic hotel. No doubt I will be staying in this hotel and another Marriott hotel again, could not fault this hotel. Thank you to all the staff and the Marriott for a fabulous night in your hotel! 
4; My son chose to get married and hold his reception at this hotel at the end of August. Having visited many hotels in the area we went back to the first one visited, the Lincombe Hall Hotel. I know it's classified as a 3* hotel, but from the moment we entered until the day we left the service was magnificent. The wedding itself was overseen by Brett and his team, who we can not praise highly enough. Our weddong party almost tok over the whole hotel for the Friday and Saturday night with guests arriving a day prior to the ceremony, which was nice as the facilities could be used. I booked in to one of the superior rooms, which was well worth the slightly higher cost as the rooms were larger and in nicer locations, although i did see the standard rooms and by UK standards these were fine. All of the hotel has recently undergone refurbishment and it feels rather like a large manor house with elegant and comfortable lounge areas. Our stay was based on bed and breakfast, and the breakfast was an English buffet selection which was fresh and kept nice and hot. I can not quote for the evening meals, but can say that the wedding meal served was of a higher than usual quality for a wedding. The grounds are in lovely condition and offer a pool and jacuzzi for summer months and a small indoor pool. The hotel would be ideal for a weekend break, couples or family holiday on the English Riviera, and is situated in a nice road within only 5 minutes walk of the harbour. I really can not praise this hotel and the staff enough 
4; The Motown event at the Casa was fantastic. The food was excellent and although you had to pre-order there was a good selection to choose for each course. The service was good and there was no waiting at the bar when you went for drinks. The live group ' life and Soul' were fantastic. The dance floor was full from the first song and all through the night. We had a great night . Everyone else seemed to be having agood night and there was a varied age range there. This was the first theme night we had been to but will deff be going again. We had a great night and deff danced the pudding off!! Look forward to more events. S Hallam 
4;" Our stay at this hotel exceeded our expectations by far. We had read good reviews so were looking forward to our stay. We were greeted with a very warm welcome at check in, we were offered a free upgrade the following evening as it was our wedding anniversary and my birthday (the hotel was fully booked when we arrived). However our room (a standard) was so lovely were were happy to remain where we were. We had patio doors which lead to a small private patio area with a table and chairs. The room, bathroom and shower were that of a superior room in comparison to other hotels I have stayed at, therefore the standard room in my opinion is of an extremely high quality.  The service provided throughout our stay was second to none. Reception staff provided us with very detailed information about the surrounding areas when inquiring about places to go for days out. The bar staff were incredibly attentive, topping up nibbles (olives and bombay style mix) regularly and of course re-filling our drinks. The restaurant staff were equally attentive, the food was excellent and the vast choice of breakfast met everyone's diet requirements.  The hotel itself is an amazing building, there is also a very large, well kept garden behind the hotel which we found to be very peaceful. The hotel has a SPA which I used and again found very enjoyable.  This hotel is a wonderful place to stay; delicious food, excellent service and beautiful surroundings. We would highly recommend staying here and would definitely come back to this hotel if we return to the area.  TIP: Parking is at the back of the hotel, its not difficult to find you simply drive past the hotel and loop around the back. "
4; As a regular user of the Hotel our Sunday lunch experience was fantastic, excellent quality of food, service and a great ambiance, just superb as usual. Love the new bar with more space to relax after a big meal. Great value for money and we have now booked to go back next week. We are also regulars of the special nights they put on and if your wanting a special evening, I would highly recommend booking into these. 
4; We stayed here for three nights and found everything we wanted in a B & B and more. The family felt more like our family by the end of the first evening. The room was clean and everything in good working order. We were offered tea and coffee at other times of the day which was a very nice gesture as it is a B & B. The breakfasts were cooked just as we asked and our two lovely waitresses were top rate. Long may they continue in this establishment as they provide that extra feeling of welcome. Especially liked the chocolates placed on our beds every evening. 
4;I booked this hotel my first wedding anniversary and was extremely happy with where we stayed. The service was amazing we were upgraded on arrival and welcomed with chocolate strawberries and a love heart on the bed:) Very romantic and the view of London was amazing! My only down side would be it is quite an expensive area so be prepared to spend some money if going out for dinner and having a few bottles of wine!!!! Would highly recommend for a special occasion:)
4; The compleat Angler is a beautiful hotel, with a great location. It over looks the river and is just a short walk into the town.  The food is amazing! and the rooms are of a good standard  definitely the place to stay if you are having a trip to marlow for business or leisure 
4;The room was ideal, nice flat screen telly, spacious, very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom - all very modern. Free 2 hrs broadband inc. Both room service food and breakfast were very tasty. The staff were very accommodating and the gym was of a high standard.
4;" Have visited this golf resort and spa on a few occasions and never had a problem. The first time I stayed at the spa was an overnight stay and meal. Everything about it was wonderful. Definitely wanted to go back for something special so Took my mum for her 50th. the variety of packages on offer helped with this decision. My mums 50th was 18 months ago and to this day she still speaks highly of the experience. The package included 4x treatments and of course the use of the facilities; jacuzzi, pool and steam room. Lunch was an extra but was worth it. My mum had a tranquil day full of highs and certainly no lows!!   All the staff are well presented and professional. The treatments we received last time; a facial, full body scrub, head, neck and shoulder massage and a deep cleanse with mud were truly beautiful.  It's clean and the scenery outside is nice. whilst having a spot of lunch, you can sit either inside or out and watch the golfers before returning back to tranquility.  Booked the Mother's Day package as a surprise present and will definitely look forward to returning!!! "
4; What a superb meal and real value for money. All the staff were so friendly and helpful most especially the chef with the beautiful smile who was carving the meat.  It was a great end to a super day would definitively go back there. 
4; So we booked into this hotel on 27th Aug with our 2 children aged 10 and 14. We had an executive club room which we found to be very clean and modern! In the price of the room there was free alcoholic drinks between 5 and 8pm, free soft drinks for the kids 24/7 and free continental breakfast which was superb! Also the option of full English at a small Extra cost which myself and partner had, gorgeous! The staff were absolutely outstanding! Nothing was a hassle, you ordered your drink at the bar and were told to find a seat and they would bring over, staff would come round after each drink and ask if we would like another, the service was absolutely impeccable! Lovely free nibbles to go with your drink, olives and peanuts presented beautifully! Good was of good quality and would well recommend! I have to mention one person who completely made our stay and that was Amu Lloyd who is your bar/restaurant manager! She was so friendly, really funny, great with every single guest and always had a smile on her face even though she had worked crazy hours! Overall a magnificent stay, can't wait to come back! 
4; This is our third visit to the Roslin, we are carers who bring a young lad who has downs syndrome for his respite. We have always been made most welcome with your staff interacting with him, nothing appears too much trouble. On our recent visit earlier this month we would like to say a big thankyou to Becca, your new receptionist, who with a welcoming smile saw to all our needs. In passing we mentioned that a friend had recommended that we visit Hullbridge for a meal, Becca suggested The Anchor as it has a good reputation, with that she kindly printed off the route for us. Just to finish the standard of the food was excellent as usual.  Regards Anne Franklin and Susan Wade 
4; Great stay at the Novotel London Bridge. Really modern and clean room, loved the frosted glass by the shower! Huge bed and large room, couldn't have asked for anything else. Great location, right by the Tube station. Friendly staff at check-in and lovely hotel bar as well, for London the prices weren't too bad at all! Breakfast choice was plentiful, it was very busy with the usual buffet rush but that's just a sign of a busy hotel and the staff were attentive and rushed around as quickly as they could to seat everyone. Looking to stay again soon! 
4; Good hotel in a good area for sightseeing. Decent size room with separate shower and toilet. All was very clean and the hotel left us a cake for my partners birthday which was a nice touch. Breakfast was good with lots of choice. Would stay again :) 
4; Me and My Husband booked a two night dinner bed and breakfast package through Hotel Exclusives and it did not disappoint. Being 37 weeks pregnant I wanted some rest and relaxation before the chaos began.So I booked a twin room which was great as we both had queen sized beds(Room 118 in the main hotel) There was a small fridge which was a nice touch to keep refreshments cool, a great selection of Nescafe and Twining's hot drinks and White Company toiletries in the bathroom. The room was a little warm as there is no air con(probably my body temperature as my normally hot Husband didn't complain) so I slept by the window, they do however also provide a small fan but we didnt use. We had dinner in Redmond's both evenings and the Table d'H^ote menu was superb, you could also pay to upgrade to the a La Carte menu or swap to the Vine's restaurant however we were that happy with the food we felt no need to. The waiter staff were both friendly and attentive and the food was served at a nice pace. Breakfast was again served in Redmond's a lovely selection of fresh fruit, juices, cereals and pastries Then hot breakfast bacon, sausage an egg station (fried/poached/scambled)etc the black pudding was a favorite of ours. If you are visiting Cheshire Oaks while you are staying be sure to mention to the reception staff as they can give you a 10% off discount slip which can be used in most stores. The bar staff at Morgan's were great serving the drinks to your table, if you are looking for a livelier bar try the clubhouse which is just left of the hotel. We booked a couple of treatments on the last day and the Spa was excellent by far the best Spa we have ever used. Swimming pool, steam room, Sauna, Jacuzzi and fire and ice buckets for those more adventurous. We had the 55 minute mum to be massage and a 55 minute Aroma massage. We were given fluffy robes, slippers and towels, shown to the refreshment station and then told to relax in one of the relaxation rooms before being collected for our treatment. Staff were attentive and could not do enough to please. Thank you Carden Park for a relaxing enjoyable break we will definitely be back with little one in tow! 
4; Only fairly recently found out the whereabouts of The Alverton Hotel having driven past it many many times without realising. I originally thought it was on the other side of Truro, what a hidden gem it is! I had lunch there today and what a treat, fabulous from start to finish. One of the best turkey meals I've had and Christmas pudding with brandy sauce-delightful. The surroundings are superb and I was lucky enough to have a little guided tour around and a peek at the Great Hall where they're putting the final touches to a Christmas party tonight. Will definitely be back again. 
4;" We have both traveled extensively and this small gem of a hotel had the best and friendliest service ever! The &quot;feature&quot; room with the glass balcony and gorgeous double bath (no tap holes at the end) was fabulous. The breakfast was delicious and it is the first time ever that we have had bubbles and freshly squeezed orange juice to start the day as part of the package!   Simply cannot rate it highly enough and if we are going to the beautiful Peak district again, this is where we will be staying. "
4; Stayed 21st and 22nd April.This is a lovely hotel ,in a very convenient ,but quiet ,location,handy for the Metro to get into the city centre.The food was excellent and ,we thought ,very reasonably priced .Although our room was small ,it was vey well equipped and comfortable. 
4; I was the first to arrive as had the first massage appointment. Felt very happy and comfortable to be on my own and the massage was lovely. Amazing! The whole package we got was great, complimentary champagne, all the waiting staff couldn't do enough for you. Only let down was the lunch, I was surprised the food wasn't a bit more up market for the price we paid and knowing how amazing the food is in the hotel. All in all had a fabulous day for the hen do and I will definitely be returning! 
4; We stayed here again following previous stays (and one previous review) prior to our recent holiday, and the hotel is faultless. The staff were polite and pleasant and the rooms were bright, airy and spotless.  I emailed in advance to request the same family rooms that we had previously, facing the runway, and the hotel went one better - a complimentary upgrade to business class, which gave us a wonderful view of the runway, making my two young sons very happy.  We've already booked again for next year as staying here is a great way to start the holiday. 
4; My husband and I opted to do our Xmas Shopping this year in Blackpool and decided to treat ourselves by booking two nights at the Imperial Hotel. We'd grown a bit tired of always ending up with a small and/or grubby room at other hotels no matter what we paid and decided to take a chance on this one. We booked via the Hotel's own website for two days, mid-week with full Dinner, Bed & Breakfast. We booked a standard room but took advantage of the hotel's 'best available room offer' which effectively meant a free upgrade to a Premium Room if one was available. This cost £109 pn for both of us.  Throughout our stay we met with with nothing but pleasantness and helpfullness from all the staff from the Reception Manger through to the cleaners. The Hotel is an Old Style Victorian, very ornate and although the decor is not brand new and a little tired in places, this is all added to it's character and didn't strike me as neglected in any shape or form. The whole place was spotlessly clean.  When we booked in, we were told a Premium Room was available and took up the offer. The room was on the first floor with a sea view and was totally gorgeous. It was extremely spacious with a 6 foot bed, seperate wardrobe area and very large bathroom with bath and over-bath shower. Again it was immaculately clean.  Breakfast was in a large ornate dining room with a buffet style breakfast that you helped yourself to and had everything you could possibly want and more. It did get busy and a little chaotic at around 9 am but that is the same wherever you go and if you want peace and quiet you just get up a little earlier. On our first day there, we were at breakfast for 07.40 am and virtually had the room to ourselves. To order in your room will only cost you an extra £3.  Dinner was lovely. There has been mention on this site of a buffet style dinner with sloppy gravy and only one meat. It wasn't like that for us. Dinner was 3 courses from a choice on offer on the menu. All courses were brought to your table and done very well and to a very high standard. We couldn't fault it or the care and attention paid to us from the serving staff.  Included in the price was free use of the Health Suite which consisted of a small gym, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and 15 metre swimming pool. Beauty and Massage treatments were also available at extra cost. It was ample for our stay though was small and can get busy at peak periods as this is also open to non-residents on a membership basis. We used it both days we stayed and never found it too crowded to be unusable and found it really nice to soak our tired little piggies in a nice hot jacuzzi after a full days shopping!   All in all we loved this hotel and now wont stay anywhere else when we visit Blackpool. I am guessing from the other reviews that some of the rooms are not up to scratch and are a little run-down but can only suggest that if you really want to ensure a touch of luxury you pay a little more and book a Premium Room with a sea view or book directly with the hotel on their 'best room available offer' and be prepared to take your chances that a Premium Room won't be available to you. As an added note, don't be afraid to book a room on the first floor, it wasn't noisy at all.  
4; I can't recommend this beautiful Regency get away spa and hotel enough so I shall waffle on. Quite literally in the best location possible, two minuets from every shop on the promenade (house of Fraser) and some of the best restaurants in town as well. However I was visiting Cheltenham as a returning ex Cheltonian I grew up and lived just round the corner from the Hotel and found the best food and cocktails (the bar upstairs THE BEST gin martini) as well as most lovely, helpful staff both day and night at the bar, reception and restaurant bistro areas, where all found within the hotel it's self!  We were shown promptly to our room on arrival, met by two lovely ladies at the desk and our jaws hit the floor. The room was breath taking and immaculately clean, the roll top cast iron bath to die for, bed - the best I've ever slept on and the room service and a la cart menu that we regularly over our two night stay demolished, couldn't have have been delivered quicker and better presented. We ate at the bistro for dinner and breakfast everything was spot on we felt like we could fully relax as everything around us was so quiet and calm and totally under control. A hotel to really fully unwind in knowing the staff there have the ability and facilities to cater to your every need at five star standard.  Definitely returning and next time hitting the spa downstairs ! 
4; We celebrated my Mother's 80th Birthday here last weekend. We had a lovely afternoon tea in the sunshine on the terrace. Excellent service & food in a lovely setting. A very thoughtful touch was a Birthday Card & present given to my mother on our arrival.  We can thoroughly recommend this venue & hope to return again when celebrating another family occasion! 
4;The views across Sanbanks bay from the terrace is stunning on a warm summers day, perfect for lunch with family/friends/partners.  The restaurant in the evenings is beautiful, decor is modern and tasteful. Food is top quality, compliments to the chef.  Will be returning again to dine. However never stayed in the hotel rooms.
4; Stayed here for one night on 15/4/16. Our room was lovely and clean, but would benefit from a fridge. Was really happy to see a bath aswell as a shower. Bed was spacious and comfortable.   Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. And all the staff were polite, helpful and friendly. A tip for future guests. Park in the public car park next to the hotel, as its half the price of the hotel car park.   In my opinion, the hotel car park should be free. I would definitely stay here again. 
4; The Derby Hotel was a wonderful place to stay. On arrival the staff were very friendly and attentive, the hospitality was fabulous. The room 'The Grand National' was very comfortable with all the facilities one could want - the bed was very comfy and the bath was amazing. Small detail but the selection of tea and biscuits that were available in the room was very good. The wifi was fast and reliable. Breakfast was delicious. We will definitely be coming back again! 
4; Just got back from a lovely overnight visit at these apartments/hotel. Arrived yesterday and was warmly welcomed. The lovely lady (sorry didn't get your name) that greeted us, asked about our journey and other pleasantries which is a little touch but makes a huge difference. We were lead to our apartment which was on the third floor but we didn't mind the stairs (is an excuse for a chocolate after) but there is a lift for those less able. After been shown where all the essentials were (button for sauna!!!) we were left to explore on our own. Our rooms were perfectly sized and me and my boyfriend commented that we would be perfectly happy to live there full time. With a seating area and kitchen which was better equipped than some friends I know, we were quite at home. The bedroom was lovely and spacious and a wardrobe that would maybe fit all my clothes in (maybe!) We had no complaints about the shiny bathroom which as I keep mentioning contains the luxury experience of the sauna. It's a diddle to work, you just flick a switch and leave it for 15 minuets then step in to heaven!!! The difference between this place and many others in which was have stayed is the attention to detail. Such as not only is there tea and coffee provided but also milk, fresh orange juice, squashes and prosecco! Furthermore is required you could order evening meals, breakfast and lunches to your apartment if required. From that point on we never saw anyone else which is just what we like when we manage to get away for a couple of days. Would highly recommend!! 
4; We had perfect day at Cockliffe House. Everything was just amazing, food, place, service, rooms, surroundings, PERFECT! Thank you to everybody at Cockliffe House for making this such a special day for us! 
4; First room we were given smelt of cigarette smoke we were soon moved to a very quiet spotless non smelly room. Smoking wavers a £50 fine in this hotel so good for us. Hotel staff gave us ice bucket for celebration sparkling wine as well as extra tea milk and coffee. Swimming pool and sauna great fun and lovely and warm. Given fresh clean towels by reception after swim which was lovely. Although a large wedding and Hen night going on at the same time we were placed in a quiet room which was very considerate Very clean hotel and excellent staff... Very close to motorway and town with food outlets esp. Lala's curry house EXCELLENT FOOD. Did not eat at Hotel and only drawback was that the restaurant is open-plan in front of the reception with a smell of toast as soon as you leave the rooms. 
4; The staff were really friendly and super helpful…from the front desk when we arrived (who remembered my first name from the booking which was a nice touch), staff on the leisure desk, house keeping and bar staff. Although parts of the building/decor could do with updating, everything was very clean and the facilities well maintained. Don't be put off by the exterior of the hotel...I had a far better experience here than I have had in the past at many other properties with a higher star rating. This is great for a stop over for leisure or business travellers. The Indian restaurant next door was great too! 
4; Hotel was exceptionally clean, spacious also room service was a dream breakfast was delivered very quickly whilst still hot a lot to eat. Staff were very polite and friendly. I will definitely be back. 
4;We stayed for one night in this hotel and couldn't fault it. The room was spacious and spotless, it was close to the shops and docks and the staff were really friendly. Would definitely recommend and stay again.
4; I would recommend this hotel to everyone.   The room was was cozy, but very well decorated and very functional, with a mini kitchen. Everything was very clean. The bed was very good and the wifi worked perfectly 
4; Great location, clean,friendly fab place. So close to liverpool 1 and albert docks. Right next door to The Slaughter House pub that does the best full english brekky for a fiver and round the corner from Meet, an Argentinian steak house, that serves the best steak and chicken i have ever tasted. The hotel is a great little find and will be keeping a secret for us to keep. A four star boutique hotel with hypnos double beds wahoo. Its serves complimentary coffee and muffins every morning. 
4; Probably the best quality hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel staff are very polite and helpful and we had a swift check in/out. The room we booked was a standard family room but it was spacious with two double beds with room for kids to play. The bathroom was also spacious and exceptionally clean with a fresh supply of towels, moisturisers, shower gel etc.   The location of the hotel is perfect in terms of access to LEGOLAND only on the condition you have a car with satnav, then it is a simple 10 minute journey. Not too sure about public transportation to the park but the hotel offers discounted tickets to both LEGOLAND and Windsor Castle.   The only issue I had with the hotels service is the food. Breakfast is an amazing buffet, which includes everything you can think of and cooked to perfection. The dinner however was different. The buffet on offer is not to everyone's tastes and it would be wise to allow customers to eat food from the Chinese restaurant in the standard restaurant where the kids make pizza. It just made it awkward to time dinner to cater to all.   The hotel also offers spa facilities. we only took advantage of the swimming pool, which was just a standard pool but is perfect as an extra bonus. The whirlpool is amazing and a lot of fun for kids aged 8+  Overall the hotel was amazing and exceeded my expectations and I would both recommend to friends and return to the hotel myself. Suitable for all from families to business trips 
4; Stayed one night at the Ainscow whilst catching up with friends and our children at uni in Manchester. Lovely warm welcome from reception staff. Very clean and modern room with contemporary decor - although not particularly spacious had everything we needed. Enjoyed a drink in the bar at the end of the day and again very friendly staff. Would recommend if visiting Manchester. 
4; 4 generations of the family stayed here in March for a100th birthday celebration. The staff were fantastic- couldn't be more helpful and flexible (especially with a 100yr old and a 6mth old to keep happy!). A subset of us stay in the Victoria suite which I would highly recommend, especially for those with young children as it has a small kitchen area. All the accommodation exceeded our expectations- modern, comfortable and clean. A great weekend. Thanks to all at the Victoria! 
4; Stayed the weekend just gone and had a wonderful time. We stayed and made full use of the excellent Spa facilities. .   Highly recommend the treatments but book in advance as they get booked up really quickly.   The staff couldn't do enough and provided first class service with a personality which is often rare.   If your staying overnight go for the taster menu simply delicious. Can't wait to come back. 
4; Just had 3 nights 3/4/5th October at Copthorne Tara and we were apprehensive having read some very negative reviews on this site. We upgraded to a club room on 11th floor and couldn't fault anything. The complimentary drinks in the club lounge between 6-8pm were an added bonus. We had an excellent meal in the Malasian/Singapore restaurant and breakfast each morning was a feast of anything one wished for. All staff were pleasant and most helpful. Didn't see any other rooms but it's a big hotel and probably has continuous refurbishment going on.....so go club class if you can and be assured of excellence Golden wedding couple. 
4;Stayed at the Megaro this weekend with my boyfriend for one night. The location was fantastic. Right next to the tube station so within seconds of leaving the hotel you could be on the tube to anywhere in London. Also just down the road from St Pancras so really useful for getting the train back home. We were able to leave our luggage with the hotel after checking out so didn't have to lug it around the city all day. The hotel was almost perfect. Really comfy bed, free tv and internet and a really cool jukebox kind of thing on the tv! Room was very minimalist and the wall to the bathroom is glass and completely see through! Not a prob for me and my boyfriend but might be a bit awkward if with family! Was very clean which is always a big thing for me. The only little niggles I had were we didn't have any milk in the fridge so we had to ask a maid for some before we could have a cup of tea, and we were only given one bottle of water. Could have done with more (especially with a hangover!) although seeing as it was complimentary suppose I can't really complain. To sum up great location, reasonably priced, plenty of complimentary things and really lovely hotel. Would def stay again.
4; Organising an event is difficult however the staff at the Norton Grange made sure the accomodation and evening meal ran smothly, in a relaxed atmosphere. From planning to delivery I was very happy with the service we recieved. All my delegates where happy with the hotel and food. 
4; Attended a fab wedding reception, everything perfect, food outstanding and a lovely warm Cumbrian welcome. Would highly recommend and cant wait to return. Nothing was too much trouble and staff very attentive. 
4; Fantastic hotel - cannot recommend it enough. Large, comfortable room, decent sized bathroom, good facilities in the room and excellent service throughout our stay. The staff were very accommodating and responded to any requests quickly. Excellent location - just a short walk to British Museum and Oxford Street, lots of places to eat nearby as well. I definitely recommend this hotel and would use again. 
4; Staff couldn't have been more helpful - we arrived 4 hours before check in and our room was ready with a free upgrade! The room itself was perfect, not too small like many London hotel rooms tastfully decorated with a good quality, comofortable bed. Breakfast was delicious, by far the best breakfast I've had in central London. Would definitely stay here if I was in London again. 
4; Just so beautiful, amazing food, fab linen, beautiful decor and hugely historic so great amazing service good location to the town. Everything is very walkable to the theatre to the houses and all the shopping round about the town. 
4; Our Ruby wedding anniversary celebration at the 'Bridge' Walshford was a superb and marvellous occasion. The delicious menu and first class service left nothing to be desired. We are delighted we selected the 'Bridge' Great value!  Peter and Maureen Dalton 
4;Just returned from a weekend break at the Holiday Inn, Winchester, UK. This is a truly beautiful, spacious, modern hotel. I last visited 4 years ago when it fist opened, and I was pleased to find that the condition of the hotel looks as pristine as it did then! Lovely rooms, delicious food that competes with the standard found in top quality restaurants, very friendly and helpful staff - this hotel deserves to be more than just a Holiday Inn! We will definitely be staying again.
4;Nothing bad to say. Bed was super comfortable. Amazing spa with outdoor hot tub. Heated beds. Heated flooring. Wonderful bars and restaurants. Staff attentive. Whole ambience of the place was second to none.
4; We've just spent a weekend here. A good central location and tastefully renovated building. Our room was lovely: elegant decor, really comfortable bed, excellent en suite, great coffee machine. Friendly and very helpful staff. Impressive food, with locally sourced ingredients. One of the best breakfast menus we've ever found, and a very good evening meal, especially the sea bass. We'd definitely go back. 
4; Stayed at this hotel for one night on 11 Feb 2014 whilst on business in London.  I have stayed here on numerous occasions in the past but this is the first time i have provided a review. The hotel is beautifully clean, the rooms are spacious, the staff are extremely polite and helpful and the food served is of the highest order. Similarly it is well located not only for a business trip to the capital but also from a tourist perspective. If you are looking for an excellent hotel in London, this is it.         If you are looking for an excellent hotel in London, this is it. 
4; Had a wonderful night in the hotel, used the pool in the morning and was pleased with that too. Corridors where a little dirty though for a 4 star hotel. Apart from it was amazing. Will be going back at some point. 
4; Stayed April 16th - 18th. Beautiful Victorian Manor house, warm welcome from staff, complimentary coffee or tea biscuits on arrival. Very attractive room fridge, jacuzzi, flat screen tv and very comfortable bed, fluffy white robes. Scenic walk along overcliff drive to Bournemouth. Breakfast to die for, extremely courteous staff, would definitely revisit. 
4; My boyfriend and I spent one night at Novotel Birmingham Centre, when we went to see Fall Out Boy at the arena. The hotel is in a great location, not far from Birmingham New Street station and close to the Barclaycard Arena, shopping and restaurants.   We both had a great nights sleep, considering the hotel is on a busy road there was no traffic noise heard. We both had breakfast, which was actually a very nice buffet styled breakfast with cooked or continental options.   All the staff members we spoke to were efficient and very polite and professional and the cleaning staff were very friendly and greeted us in the morning. Overall the stay was a nice little get away! 
4; Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel for One night whilst going to a gig at the O2 areana. We were very very impressed with this hotel, its probably the best ive ever stayed in. We wanted to be quite close to the O2, and on the tube this took around 10 minutes from the hotel to the O2. As soon as you walk out of the tube station the hotel is right infront of you. Very easy access to the O2 and Waterloo stations.  The hotel was so so clean. Our room was huge! It had a wet room and the beds were comfy. It was really peaceful and quiet and we were just very happy with how clean and maintained it was. It was very modern.  The staff were friendly and check in and check out was really quick. We requested a room on the highest floor possible as we aren't too fond of low floors, and we were given the highest floor with a view over the river. It was lovely!!  As we only stayed here for one night, it was perfect as we didnt want to spend to much, but if we ever go back to London we will be staying here.  Lovely staff, clean hotel and lovely quiet rooms and amazing location. Very impressed! Defo reccomend! 
4; Each August for the past seven years we have hosted an evening function for up to 40 New Zealanders at The Old White Lion Inn, and each year all of our expectations - which are always high - have been exceeded! This year was no exception. The welcome was exceptionally warm, the function room was always beautifully set up, the food senstational, and the service extremely efficient and courteous. Thank you once again to all concerned. 
4; This is a lovely, friendly and spotless hotel. The room was much larger than we were expecting, we'd booked a classic double so expected it to be just a bed, chair, and table and in all fairness that's what we got but with a big WOW. The bed was so comfortable, a really good sleep even on the first night. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds well worth a stroll around. A fab hotel. 
4; I have been there in October last week, it was great to have a room at such beautiful location. I really enjoyed my stay over there. It was comfortable and services was really good including the food. Recommended!! 
4; We recently visited the Swan hotel to celebrate my sister's bridal shower. The staff at the Swan were incredibly helpful and recommended The Scullery as a private venue for the occasion at no extra cost. When we arrived, the afternoon tea was served prompt and we had a generous amount of sandwiches and cakes etc. The staff were extremely attentive and were vigilant when tea and coffee needed replenishing. I would highly recommend dining at the Swan hotel. Great atmosphere and gorgeous quirky vintage furnishings. 
4; My Partner and I stayed here on NYE it was absolutely fabulous. We'd spent a few days in Liverpool in the summer and saw the Hotel been renovated before opening and with my partner being a massive Liverpool fan and having numerous memories of Bill Shankly it was an must for us to sample. It without doubt lived up to expectations, from checking in, the staff, the room, the bar, the food and probably more important to my partner the memorabilia of such a legendary figure. We are already in the next few days looking at booking a return visit this time bringing our family along so they can also sample the wonderful Shankly Hotel. 
4;We had a lovely 4 night stay at Sandbanks in July. The new rooms with sea balcony were spacious with wonderful views. Rooms cleaned every day which was a treat and all hotel staff were really helpful. The only drag was the long trek to the rooms in the new extension. The Funsters were a great option for children's entertainment without dominating the hotel experience. Breakfast was good value- minor things could be improved- better quality juices and fruit, wider cereal selection- but my children thought it was all great. The bar food was good and you really can't beat the lovely beach location when the British Summer is at its best. I would definitely go back again.
4;This is a beautiful building set in lovely gardens. We stayed in a standard room in the separate annexe and it was clean, comfortable and well equipped. We had dinner in the elegant dining room overlooking the gardens and the food and service were excellent. Breakfast the following morning was very good as well - the English breakfast was beautifully cooked and presented and again the service was excellent. All in all a great stay!
4; A massive thanks to Mala, Kevin and the team at Frensham for making our wedding reception absolutely amazing! The food was fabulous, the staff were so professional and have excellent customer service skills. Nearly all of our 103 guests said it was the best wedding they have ever attended. Nothing was too much trouble and it's rare to get this kind of excellent service these days. Thanks so much! - April & Greg. 
4; We stayed here on there' Somerset garden break'. This included overnight stay, evening meal, breakfast and tickets to Hestercombe gardens. As this was a special anniversary gift from our children I cannot say if it was valued for money but it was fantastic. We stayed in the Blackdown Suite which was huge as was the bed, dinner was fine cuisine dining and beautifully presented also very tasty. Breakfast was everything you could wish for. Staff were very friendly and helpful. 
4; Absolutely beautiful both the hotel and the grounds. The garden is like I've never seen before. The food is next to none and the staff are so experienced and attentive. the only thing is it is a wee bit out of town. 
4; we were very happy with all our stay at Novotel in Birmingham. they are a bunch of really nice and happy people who enjoy their work place and at the same time they provide a professional service. The location was very good- a walking distance to the City - mind you it d be a bit too loud for some people as it s next to the pubs and party places. As always we did enjoy our b fast. good choice of full english option. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was big too with the bath and walk in shower. 
4; The staff were all very courteous and helpful at check-in and even introduced me to the free Wi-Fi in-room facilities. Parking was also included in the price and was a secure underground carpark which meant that I was dry even though it was pouring outside! The rooms were bright, clean and airy and the floor to ceiling windows made the room feel even larger. Overall, it was an excellent experience and would definitey recommend for its out of city location and also good value for the price. 
4; Excellent accommodation, extremely friendly and helpful staff, got a nice upgrade to a junior suite. Claire was the receptionist who looked after check in and was lovely. Big thank you to all staff. Definitely stay again - so central. 
4;This hotel is my favourite as it is very comfortable with seperate living area/ bedroom. Also love the breakfast in a box idea as I don't eat first thing so really nice to be able to take breakfast to be enjoyed later.
4;Spent a fantastic evening at HDNH celebrating a friends birthday. The meal was fantastic, waiting on staff excellent and the whole ambience was perfect. The icing on the cake was the superb front of house team who tried,repeatedly, to get us a taxi on one of the busiest nights in Liverpool. They were, eventually, successful and waved us off after an absolutely brilliant night at their venue. Many thanks to you all
4; Flying out of Birmingham at 6:30am so thought we would stay over the night before to save a tiring car journey early morning. Looked at all the usual hotels and the Novotel was com8ng up only £8 more expensive than the premier inn for which we would have had to pay £10 taxi fare to get to the airport. The Novotel is on site. We came into Birmingham International train station and followed the signs for the airport. Caught a metro mover shuttle which took us to Departures and as we came outside the Novotel was quite simply there. Lovely modern hotel with an xbox in the lobby for kids. We ate in the bar and although its thd usual high prices as its a hotel, the food was really good. Bed comfy and our 10yr old had the sofa bed which was big and comfy too. Bathroom modern and awesome shower. Brilliant hotel, cant fault it. 
4; My family and I stayed at The Carlton this weekend as we were attending a relatives christening. We had 2 double rooms, both were slightly different in shape and decor but equipped with the same facilities. The staff upon check in were very friendly and smiley and nothing was too much to ask. We had heavy luggage and a pushchair and they offered to carry our things to our room for us. Nothing was too much trouble!   We had dinner in the restaurant on Saturday night and it was BEAUTIFUL! I had salmon with various vegetables which was silver-served to us and my husband had a chicken dish which he said was devine!! There was a great selection of choices at breakfast including full English cooked to order, cereals and yoghurt's etc.   Would definitely recommend to a friend and will be sure to stay here again if we visit Rugby again! 
4; Slightly concerned as to my Husbands reaction to the pod bedroom however pleasantly surprised. I guess when you really think about it do we need the dodgy bedside tables, lamps (with pink lampshades) random furniture you never utilise and always slightly dusty ornaments. Citizen M keeps it streamline, the bed however is huge and the shower pod is clean with no tiles to harbour that lovely London mould. The self check in has human backup just in case the whole experience might be overwhelming. The bar was friendly and the staff very accommodating. Will be going back as great location and value for money. 
4; Lovely setting, right next to Lancaster University and very easy to get to by car. The rooms are lovely and exceptionally clean. We had a good powerful shower, which is always a treat. Reception area is really welcoming with a roaring fire and cosy seating area. Staff are very friendly and are happy to deal with any enquiries. The bar area is good and you can have bar meals in there if you don't want to go into the restaurant. We ate in the restaurant which was very good with a good atmosphere. Didn't use the fitness area or pool, but staff were happy for us to take a look for next time. Pool looks great. There is a nice walk out from the hotel in the grounds surrounding it and the uni. Breakfast was really good as well. Overall we had a lovely stay and look forward to next time. 
4; We stayed here for four nights for a long weekend to explore the Somerset Levels, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a lovely location, looking on to the village green at the front and with a courtyard and terraced lawns at the back. We were asked to ring and let them know if we wanted a dinner reservation the day we arrived, which we did, and the table was booked, the food was excellent and the service very relaxed and cheerful. The restaurant was pretty busy and is obviously a popular eating place locally. Our room was clean, airy and spacious with bottled water provided each day. The room had a flat screen TV with all the freeview channels, but the screen couldn't be angled, so was visible from the bed but not the sofa. The en suite bathroom was a reasonable size and the shower first rate.  The service at breakfast could be a bit slow and haphazard but the food itself was very good. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to a friend, and have already done so! 
4; Had a lovely stay at the Crowne Plaza when staying overnight in Manchester for my brother's graduation. Check-in was quick and easy, rooms were spacious and beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was lovely compared to most hotel bathrooms! It was also spacious and very clean. Staff were pleasant and the hotel wasn't noisy which ensured for a quiet and peaceful nights sleep. Perfect! 
4; Stayed for a night in a family room. Checked in early, room was ready but had to ask the housekeeping to set up the double sofa bed for the kids. No problem as we were early.  Requested a room near pool facilities and was granted on arrival.   Love how management had put a lot of thought for their younger guests.  They offered free milk and cookies for kids plus activity pack to keep my daughters busy. And instant hot choc sachet was left in the room too.  Pool has a leisure family lane, for those with kids.  Eldest daughter was thrilled to see a play area but unfortunately the toys were put away later in the afternoon. My suggestion to the hotel is to keep this as a permanent fixture, kids can play there while parents are eating in the restaurant or at the bar close by.  Food at breakfast and dinner was really good but difficult for young kids as the restaurant opens at 6.30pm for dinner and they normally in bed by 7.30pm.  Staff we encountered were all really friendly and helpful. Will go back 
4; Visited with friends, on arrival greeted very warmly. One of the nicest rooms ive ever stayed in, everything was nice and fresh. Bed was very comfy Would stay here again without doubt, would recommend, hope to stay longer next time. 
4; After asking some friends which was the best hotel to stay in Coventry, we were told Ramada, I booked but wasn’t looking forward to it reading some reviews, it was my birthday so my boyfriend and I checked in on the Saturday having booked a good deal through hotel.com - £49!. We arrived early and straight away we need not have worried!  HELLO! The receptionist said as soon as we walked through the entrance, the staff were so warm and welcoming, she asked why we were in Coventry, and then offered us an upgrade to one their bigger suites, which we took for only an extra £20. The reception area was very impressive but could do with a bit of a modern update.  The room when we got up to the 16th floor was HUGE, with the best views of Coventry you could wish for, there was separate living area, with lounge and separate bedroom and bathroom, everywhere was spotless really impressive!  We were meeting some friends for drinks later that night, so we decided to have dinner in the hotel before we went out, we went down to the restaurant about 6pm, and again we were greeted with a big hello, Andrea i think her name was... spent a good few minutes explaining the menu, and specials, all of which were Italian as the restaurant is authentic Italian, the service was quick and efficient and the restaurant looked lovely and very intimate, the food was amazing when it arrived, if you do dine here you must try the sea bass and the pasta dishes are so good. What happened next was lovely, the chef and duty manager bought a cake out that the hotel had baked and gave us to celebrate my birthday – how wonderful you would never get that in a Travelodge or premier inn!!  The rest of the stay was lovely, the beds are so comfortable and the breakfast next day was just as good as the meal the night before, well done Ramada the team at Coventry are great and I will definitely recommend all to stay here, we will be back! 
4; Sadly we had only planned a one night stay but hope to return before too long. Our room was excellent, with a spacious well finished bathroom and a mattress on the bed that Goldilocks would have totally approved of. The menu choice for both dinner & breakfast was good and the staff were attentive & friendly. Coupled with a promotional deal, what more can one ask for?! 
4; I want to praise MANDEEP on reception, I arrived today and was made very welcome by MANDEEP,the world would be a better place if there were more people like him! The room was super,the most comfy bed ever. 
4; Fabulous room, excellent facilities & great view, just a few of the delightful things we experienced during our stay at the end of January. Stayed 2 nights after seeing Sarah Millican at the Pavilion Theatre. 
4; Spent a weekend in Harrogate to visit friends and stayed at the Kimberley. Location as well as good remarks on tripadvisor helped me make up my mind to stay. The town is only a short distance and we met in the town, so walked there easily. Clean, nice room and friendly competent reception staff. Great buffet breakfast. Found it good value and would stay again. 
4; I attended an afternoon tea in celebration of a niece's wedding and apart from the tasty and plentiful food on offer (together with unlimited tea or coffee), the staff were exceptional. Very attentive, professional and friendly. Couldn't fault the food or service. Thank you. 
4; Stayed at the hotel few weeks ago, had a lovely welcome, stayed in double accomodation, it was a good size room, before checking in had the linguine dish which you must try! as it was delicious. Really stunning looking hotel in a beautiful location. Didnt manage to swim in pool but definatly will next time we visit as missed out on gym and sauna facillities aswell unfortunatly. After a pleasant night, came down to a filling cooked breakfast and a lovely group of staff who sent us away with an attraction of coming back again. Definatly use this hotel for my next venue. Thankyou to all staff for making us feel welcome. 
4; This hotel excels itself in every way. Amazing service from the moment we entered the doors, concierge was just what you'd expect. We didn't have chance to try any of the dinner service but breakfast was adequate, full English or continental available. The room was clean, maybe a little small but it was big enough for what we needed. Bathroom was beautiful, very modern. Don't have any complains, would stay again. I will say that you get what you pay for here though, it's not a 'cheap' hotel, but if you have the money to stay here, do it. 
4; From the moment you drive up to Sopwell House to the moment you leave you will feel pampered and spoilt. Myself and my friend have been recommending it to everyone and are planning to visit again next year. Go on....book it.....because you're worth it! 
4; Yet another gift of afternoon tea here - it is a little pricey, but worth it. Our little girl loves their scones and races towards the end goal of the cakes. Always enjoy it, but the lounge certainly sets it off. What better way to enjoy an afternoon than with family, eating sandwiches, scones and cakes with enough tea to sink a ship with... 
4; There must be many strange requests, but the staff found us a cake knife without batting an eyelid.  Fantastic friendly staff. Great location. Amazing rooms 
4; Had a fabulous weekend away to celebrate my special birthday. Took our family with us - including 4 young grandchildren. The rooms were fabulous - everything you could want. The bar meals were brilliant and good choice of ales on tap - the bistro meals were fantastic and all the staff were excellent - couldn't do enough for us - including NEIL! This made it a very special weekend treat for us all. the children thoroughly enjoyed themselves - Stratford is a fabulous place to visit and we had a lovely boat trip - the Sunday craft market was lovely - and we loved the town - plenty of shops and pubs. The children were very welcome in the hotel and restaurant - we felt very comfortable. 
4;" These apartments are INCREDIBLE! I booked 2 apartments (one Maxi and the penthouse) for a hen party and everyone was blown away. Not only is the location perfect, so was the service. The staff couldn't do enough to help on the ;ead up to the booking or during our stay. The apartments were spotless with everything you could need included and I would recommend 100%. "
4; Stayed here for my boyfriends birthday in May 2012. As soon as we arrived at the hotel and checked in the woman asked whos birthday it was and upgraded us free of charge with access to the gentelmans club which served drinks and canapes free of charge all night. The view was amazing and we ended up having a gorgeous breakfast in bed overlooking the city. The room was spacious and just what we needed. 
4;I would just like to share my experience of when me and my husband stayed at Ashdown. we first went there after we got married as a mini honeymoon and it was lovely, the staff were very pleasant and the food was exquisite. The grounds and the buildings made you feel very relaxed walking around them and the spa was very nice as well.  It is lovely and clean in the rooms and the bathroom & everything is very well kept and maintained. Unfortunately on our first stay the pool was a little cold but otherwise everything else was wonderful and I could not fault it. We went back a year later for our first anniversary and I have to say everything about our stay was perfect. We had champagne in the room and chocolates too, the staff were even more helpful than our previous stay and it was a wonderful night away. I disagree with the below post as our bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in and I slept the best I slept in a long time! It was lovely :-) I had the pleasure of emailing Ben Booker before our second stay and have to add to this review that he is a very welcoming manager that goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable on your stay and makes sure everything runs smoothly from the moment you arrive to the moment you check out. We have now nearly been married 4 years and are very much considering returning to Ashdown because our last two stays were so lovely. I would highly recommend this as the place to stay if you love the countryside, fantastic service & wonderful staff. Mrs S Cheeseman
4; Can't find anything to fault with this hotel, brand new, very clean and smart, friendly and helpful staff.  My room was a decent size and had all I needed. It was spotlessly clean.  Parking on site (chargeable but discounted) and the sat Nav even took me directly to the car park! Breakfast was acceptable. Plenty of choice and I was quick to be served. I didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening as I felt it was a little expensive, ut plenty of other places around to eat.  Great location and I would definitely stay again. 
4; Amazing hotel in a great location - as soon as we arrived we were welcomed by friendly staff who uograded all 4 rooms we had booked as it was my friends 40th birthday weekend. The decor in the hotel, style and cleanliness all led to a brilliant weekend. The location is ideal for a 10 minute walk or short cab ride to Shoreditch - check out Curtain Lane area for a mooch around shops, galleries and good eateries/street style cafes for a lazy afternoon. Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for quality products and style and really great staff who were professional but relaxed and helpful. 
4; The hotel had no problem accommodating us for 1 night only, on a weekend, which is unusual when most places insist on 2 nights minimum stay. When we turned up early, the friendly and helpful staff were great. We were upgraded to a deluxe room from a standard, and it was spacious, well equipped and very stylish. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom, though compact, was excellent. It was very clean and we loved the rainshower over the bath. The hotel's location is central, easy walking distance from the shops bars & restaurants, yet we had a very quiet night. We also spent some time in the bar, which was buzzing, and the young team of staff were faultlessly efficient and friendly. As you might have gathered - we were very impressed and had a great stay.
