negative, Family xmas dinner was spoilt by the terrible meal we had Suppose you get what you pay for but come on people I ve had better ready meals  pre fabricated food  serving staff friendly enough but a very miserable barman  cheer up fella I m giving you my hard earned money  my first time here and will be my last 
negative, Booked this place for our office Xmas lunch Prices were 16 95 for 2 courses 21 95 for 3 courses What wasn t evident when we booked is that a 10 service charge is added as well so everyone had to fork out more money than first thought I ordered the salmon for my main course and although this was tasty it came with 5 slices of chorizo and a handful baby hand size of broccoli tips Nothing else so the meal looked like a starter on the plate Other mains included a dish of fresh vegetables Based on this I wouldn t go back again as being charged almost 22 for a starter and another starter masquerading as a main course isn t something I m prepared to pay for Think this place needs to look at the menu again and offer customers a decent plate of food especially at the prices they charge Most of our group agreed that the people who had the salmon got short changed for their money Definately won t be recommending this place and won t be going back 
negative, Thought we d give it a try whilst out shopping Service was poor I ordered a ploughman s which consisted of a plate of lettuce pork pie 3 pickled onions and grated cheese No slab of local cheese no sliced ham I would suggest trying one of the other local cafes that put some effort and pride into their work 
negative, Have to say we couldn t fault the service we weren t kept waiting at all But the food was truly awful Processed chicken poor quality pasta which was sent back as there was hardly a mushroom or piece of bacon in sight and a burger and chips that must have been bought in from Tesco value range At 55 with drinks not value for money Also very noisy and every ten minutes it seemed it was someone s birthday so you get the obligatory birthday song followed by Congratulations by Cliff Cringeworthy Good place for teenagers only 
negative, Having hear many good things about this restaurant and seen good reviews on Trip Advisor I visited with colleagues Jesmond branch   We hadn t booked but were quickly seated  and then completely ignored Staff were wandering back and forth including the waiter who had seated us but nothing No attempt to see if we wanted drinks or anything  After 15 minutes we put our coats on and walked out past several members of staff who all ignored us again and went for a curry just around the corner where we had drinks in seconds and poppadoms in less than 2 minutes  Another guest at the hotel we were staying at went in as we were leaving and was served as normal though he is a regular  so it must have been us that they objected to 
negative, Went here with my wife Food was ok but only ok What really stunned us was how the management spoke to and treated their young staff They work so hard and are so friendly but the so called management seem to talk to and treat them like dirt Very uncomfortable   Needs a change in that area as so much potential  
negative, Been longing to try this restaurant for lunch for ages Welcome at reception poor Not offered drink in the bar first Taken straight table Temperature cool Warmer in the rest rooms Three tables only occupied Zero atmosphere Tiny overpriced portions of tasteless food Everything needed chilli sauce to get some kind of flavour Sommelier poor Wine bucket kept a mile away from our table Had to keep hailing Sommelier to refill our glasses Bill outrageous for what we had  225 for two people at lunchtime Left restaurant hungry and feeling ripped right off Will not return 
negative, We were looking forward to eating there The pub is great with lots of beers on offer However the menu was pretty limited and what was on the board quite expensive so we chose the burgers There were 4 of us and all agreed the quality was below par and overcooked The presentation was good But at 11 I felt ripped of I will go there again for the beers and the atmosphere but will give the food a miss 
negative, What can I say Waited 15 mins in queue to place order then waited 40 mins for food  Turned up cold Burger with two pieces lettice Chips not cooked and cold Complete waste of money Sent stinker email to Greenking You can guess no reply 40 spent on four  Will never ever return Crap food for your money Better at the Globe  And thats saying something 
negative,We had a friendly and helpful waitress however the food was of a very low quality I had the Saltimbocca Chicken which was very dry The vegetables looked and tasted like microwaved leftovers We had to give the onion rings back I am not a fussy eater so to leave anything behind is rare for me 
negative, We visited this pub earlier this evening Not impressed at all Slow service over cooked food in a cold environment Nothing more to say other than we won t be visiting this place again 
negative,Nothing  Called in at the Cool River Cafe yesterday for a breakfast Arrived at 11 10am and placed our order for a full English for 2 people  At 11 45 we asked when the food would be delivered to our table and 5 minutes later we were told that the order hadn t made it to the kitchen and that the chef was now refusing to cook breakfasts We decided to then order something from the lunch menu  Thinking that having already been made to wait 35 minutes the cafe would make an effort to get our second order to us quickly we finally gave up at 12 10pm when there was no sign of our food arriving  We did have a coffee and it was OK not breathtakingly good or bad The cafe seems to be ok at serving cakes and drinks but hot food seems to be an issue In our hour sat there we saw other people get up to leave having either not been served or having waited too long for their order  I m not sure if it was a bad day for the establishment but I won t be going back to find out if it was  Very disappointing 
negative, I popped in on way back home after work There place had no redeeming features The food and staff were slightly below average Sorry 
negative, On holiday with family and asked a local in our hotel where was a good place to go for a cheapish basic meal He recommended The Bowling Green  wish I d checked TripAdvisor like I normally do before deciding to go anywhere - I d say the recent reviews are probably accurate When we arrived things didnt look good lots of tables uncleared one table full of dirty glasses that staff hadnt got round to sorting customers including me waiting at the counter to be served I ordered our drinks and then asked for 2 carverys time was 18 30 i was told there was no meat remaining the only food available to us was battered fish shepherds pie or a balti pie It was past my 15 month old daughters tea time and since she was getting upset felt we couldn t now go elsewhere Both pies were on the carvery counter they looked dried up I should have refused them and asked for my money back the vegetables from the carvery section also were dried up or practically gone I had the last chips with people behind me with fish now needing chips but none for them There were a number of people complaining formally and informally I have to say the food was a bad as it looked   only paid 12 for the food and drinks but it wasn t even worth that Our soft drinks in pint glasses were even about 20mm from full I wouldn t return here for a free meal one of the worst meals I ve ever had 
negative, Rude Waitresses that don t know food or wine  Chefs that cannot cook How can you ruin a steak they can  Ludicrous west end like prices  A bit like Fawlty Towers in Honor Oak Go along and watch the shambles 
negative, The restaurant at the hotel advertises lunch etc  so we took our family there over Easter Monday we were told to be out of the place by 5 because they had a big party however the waitress was soon explaining that lots of food had run out and more amazing was that they had no bottle beer the service was bad slow and always forgetting items so much so that they took 30 off the bill we waiting some 1 and half hours for the first course and spent some 2 hours more eating or waiting a great pity since the location is great but the service and supply of essentials is miserably lacking 
negative, We were attending an event in Walsall and noticed Table Table was only a mile from our hotel We downloaded a menu and it looked quite exciting We arrived and ordered and our excitement went rapidly downhill The chicken ham and mushroom pie looked impressive but was literally full of hot air very little filling and don t order mash with it you will only get a sliver The lasagne looked nice and tasted good but was only about half an inch thick Our fourth member ordered salmon but it was very dry The meal wasn t cheap 55 for 4 including a drink each but it was the portions which was surprising and I don t think it was just me it looked pretty quiet for a Saturday evening 
negative, Upon first entering the venue I should known straight away this wasn t going to be the experience I hoped for in a picturesque place of Lacock As we looked for a table we were greeted  I mean shouted at by a man who I assume from other reviews is the manager of the pub He informed us that as we were a party of 3 2 adults and a 3 year old  we could not sit at a square table out the front for 4 people Never have I heard this before  and therefore we would have to go out to the back on a small round table where flies were abundant Personally I do think they want children to be in the venue even though they offer a children s menu  Anyway after taking up his generous offer of the table out the back little one was very hungry  we ordered food after a mere 50 minute wait we were bought over some average food but to be honest we were so hungry we didn t care  Personally I don t think they can handle busy periods and multiple food order  Finally to tick all the boxes they got our bill incorrect and added another tables food order to our order  Sigh   To be honest this is the first negative review i have made on trip-advisor however we were appalled at this man s customer service skills  Not just to us but to anyone coming into the venue  short answers refusal to serve food due to number of people in the party along with his tone of voice  However I must confirm that the waitresses who work at the venue are very pleasant Overall the upshot is terrible place and will never return which is a shame as it could be a lovely place 
negative, Christmas Day lunch Taken to table 35mins after booking time Previous party s mess under table Food was very poor  How do you eat sorbet with a fork No staff What a waste of money  
negative, We came to Bella Italia needing a late lunch and we had been a few years back and it had been acceptable The menu looked so good My chose a spaghetti with prawns and a pot of mint tea and she said it was OK and the portion of prawns was generous But we asked for some breads to go with our meal with an Olive Oil Balsamic vinegar bowl and this turned up at once rather than with our main courses To our horror the Olive oil and Balsamico would not combine - all we got was the taste of Olive Oil For my meal I chose a Lamb dish with pasta choosing to have a spiralised vegetable serving which they offered instead of having the pasta It was disgusting The vegetable combination was fine but it was served in a thin sauce and there were no pieces of lamb at all only a few tiny shred of minced lamb To make matters worse I had ordered a glass of the house wine and would you believe it they told me that they were sold out at only 2 30pm  of the house wine From my wife s perspective it was just Ok but from mine it was awful - I don t understand how this place remains in business it used to be very acceptable 
negative, This used to be a well managed operation with good food and service     I would recommend NOT going to this restaurant unless you don t mind paying high prices receiving at best Luke warm average food together with service that is pretty much non existent  It takes a lot for me to write and complain but this place needs completely new management 
negative, Lovely friendly waitress willing to help with accessabilty problems Food ordered was delivered incorrect tried a second time food arrived wrong again and skewers were cold Toilets were dirty Customers were packed in like sardines Give this place a miss 
negative, Have been on a diet and was looking forward to my cheat day after a 50mile bike ride but the reality between what I was hoping for and what we received was so far apart   We went for the sharing tray at 40 there was no onion rings clearly they buy them in frozen as how there is many supermarket around to buy more instead we could have some extra fries there was more fries than meat  The pulled pork was cold dry and very poor The beef brisket was the only thing that was good the ribs were dry overlooked and Luke warm and the chicken was so dry couldn t eat it The mac n cheese was nice and hot  But I went to grill stock for some bbq meats and was sadly left disappointed  I would never return and never recommend with the grill stock festival I Bristol this weekend maybe they should pay more attention to the food they actually serve in the restaurants that are living off the name 
negative,Late night stop for a coffee soya cappuccino and a regular cappuccino and whilst being served by Brice who was really nice we asked if there was anything to eat which was wheat and gluten free as my wife hadn t eaten and has coeliac disease I ve unable to eat wheat or gluten containing foods Over the shoulder of Brice the gentleman who was preparing the coffee said that wheat and gluten free are not our core customers thereby immediately excluding my wife as a customer and certainly showing a very interesting form of disrespect and prejudice against her condition As it was we then declined whatever foods were on offer and took the coffee with the gentleman barista exclaiming it must be my English you didn t understand     heck no we understood perfectly and I was of a mind to ditch your coffee too and go to Starbucks opposite Time for the fast food outlets to realise they have multiple sources of customer and I for one will now be advising people to choose other than Pret A Manger I am disappointed and disgusted at this lack of interest in a section of the community I shall be contacting Clive Schlee the CEO when I have the opportunity on Monday The coffee was OK no great shakes and the service by Brice was perfect and very friendly   his colleague the barista gentleman was a total waste of space Last chance Pret A Manger and you lost 
negative,Popped in a short while ago with friends we often do being very local and very regular Today there was ten of us and we had with us our cocker spaniel also a frequent visitor to the pub He s with us for drinks and he s with us when we order food one of the family  So I was very disappointed when I was told upon arrival that we couldn t have the dog on the carpeted area this being most of the bar So our daughter returned home with our dog who incidentally is a highly trained and extremely obedient gun dog  Imagine our disgust when not five minutes later a party was shown to their table with a dog Seated at their table on the carpeted area  What s going on White Horse One rule for the regulars that have spent many hundreds of pounds with you held functions and parties there and one rule for the others Shame really we ve put up with the increasing prices and diminishing service poor quality frozen re-heats and the reductions in portion sizes  But this for us was the final straw the friendship of Derek and some staff can now no longer outweigh all the failings  Thanks and goodbye 
negative, The staff are in serious need of customer service course the food needs to be cooked properly and the tables cleaned a little more often  It took 50mins for them to serve up a burger a gammon steak and two pies At one point the waitress brought the dessert menus over cos she thought we d already had our food  It wasn t like they were rushed off their feet   This place badly lets down a chain of restaurants that is usually very good  Normally I would have complained but - I just couldn t be bothered Just paid up and left In fact I suspect that if we had just got up and walked out without paying we d have been twenty minutes down the road before anyone noticed  Seriously - don t 
negative, I am trying again tonight  I have had to leave on 4 previous visits due to non-availability  I am trying to make a go of this with a family that support the harvester on a weekly event supporting the North London branch  have found it may come to an end  I have a 17 month old child and Wife that have been even offered by the manager let s call her Mrs C for protection of her rights has promised us that we will be fast tracked on our next visit due to the past inconvenienced visits so I will give them a try tonight at 6 30 hoping they will be free I have been told I will get a seat as they don t normally reserve seats Except on Mon  Thur So let s get the inspection report out and let you all know what the outcome is 
negative, The last 4 reviews can t be wrong and they re not It s so tacky in this place and the food is offensively average Avoid 
negative, I visited the Cunning Man with 6 members of my family to celebrate my daughter s birthday She booked a table for 5 30 pm as we had 2 young grandsons with us and did not leave the restaurant until after 8 00 pm Far too long for a 2 course meal with 1 round of drinks Twice our son-in-law had to take his 4 year old for a walk as he was getting restless We were kept waiting when we arrived before being shown to our table we had to wait to place our drinks order which then took some time to arrive We were then approached by a waiter who said he was looking after us we placed our food order and then informed there would be a 30 minute wait this was probably more like 40 minutes The food to be fair was not too bad although the vegetables could have been warmer The waiter asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu but in such a way that he did not really want us to we had already decided that we would forego a starter in favour of a dessert so we did order It probably took another 30 minutes for our desserts to arrive and when they did the custard on 3 of them was cold with a thick skin on top The staff did not appear to be enjoying their work and some were quite rude The manager was going around in a panic trying to pacify what appeared to be quite a few disgruntled customers I actually overheard him say to one couple as he sat them down not to judge the Cunning Man on tonight as there was a new menu which meant everything had to be cooked from fresh and they were struggling to keep up I can only judge from my experience on the night and will not be returning By the time we left people were leaving due to the number of items unavailable To top everything off the waiter tried to overcharge me on my debit card when I pointed out that the amount was different to that shown on the bill he apologised and said he must have input the wrong number 
negative, This pub has got another TripAdvisor page as Branocs Tree This review is just a copy of the one I left under Branocs  Just been to new Branocs Hungry Horse  What a disaster Food took almost an hour to arrive we were told maximum 40 minutes wait when we ordered at the bar When we got our food chips were cold roast potatoes cold my dad s steak was supposed to be medium and was so well done he couldn t cut it We complained and was waiting another 15 minutes for replacement Bar prices very steep have been to few hungry horses is Essex and Braintree was so expensive - more than 50p per pint of lager Apart from one in Rochford we were there last summer and found staff rude we always love visiting hungry horses we always eat in Laindon and sometimes in Harlow food is always within 30 minutes on Sundays and staff are so nice and helpful Don t expect it in Branocs We were sitting next to the kitchen on the booth and all we could hear was staff complaining about each other and manager Geoff Apparently another manager Lee is on holidays and Geoff guy cannot run pub at all without the other one Apparently staff cannot believe that Geoff still have a job because all he does when he works is stand in kitchen and is afraid of serving customers That s not something that you want to hear from staff when u waiting for your food Found whole visit very poor The only good point was lovely decor of the pub we wish our local in Laindon looked like that 
negative,Very very expensive For quality of food Potato skins tasteless Oven chips says it all Pudding Tesco do better 
negative, This pub should be the busiest pub in Bexley it s in a gorgeous old building in a park full of families but no The staff are rude and lok like they haven t changed in a week none of the 3 real ales were available and half of the lagers and the Guinness were out too and they only had 1 available wine choice on a Saturday afternoon in addition to that the amount of people sending their food back for being wrong or inedible was shocking and I chose not to order the place is a disgrace to the chain that owns it 
negative, meal for 1 quarter of pizza had topping stone cold and staff said it happens sometimes Will never return to this sub standard hut 
negative, Seems all ok from outside but do not be deceived Food cold food old food is simply poison You will I repeat want will get food poisoned Drinks well overpriced Staff pretend to be nice until you don t want to pay for the rubbish you have eaten Please stay away if you love the people you are with  
negative, To start off with the good reviews must be from those drinking in the working and club down the street as you would have to be drunk to eat at Red luck It s never been the best looking place and the food is so discussing over cooked burnt really heated ribs very bland food As for to separate things and they put them together I ve lived in the area for 10 yrs and I ve never seen or had a bad discus tic Chinese than I and my family have had from Red Luck 
negative, The below info was submitted via there contact details on there website  Although I did specify I don t expect a reply  they really didn t reply Is this arrogance or just ignorance I certainly will not be visiting here again and such a shame as this place used to be terrific and the village is brilliant  Lack lustre is what I would regard my experience today And my mother in laws birthday experience at the spotted cow can what only be described as cringeworthy  Waiting time to be seated AFTER time booked was 30 mins Soft drinks flat and poured from a plastic bottle Drink served in various odd types of an array of glasses More fat than meat on the carvers selection My meal from from the menu arrived 40mins AFTER my family had eaten My meal was under cooked and very very sub standard No check backs No cutlery provided and had to ask twice once food had arrived We were told deserts would be ten minutes when we had to order our own from the bar because we were sick and tired of waiting 30 minutes later deserts came undercooked cold and apples were hard with no pastry Once we returned them the second lot came out of replacement but again no cutlery provided No check backs AGAIN Toilets were a disgrace and I dont even expect a nightclub to be in that kind of order let alone a family pub Serious health and safety risk here No children changing area at all apart from a seat and when we informed with some feedback of this all we got was  ok  You had four children all of around 1-3 years old in the pub whilst our visit No real figure s of authority and seemed very disorganised through out the whole area  I m sorry that it has come to an email like this and I m not expecting any kind of response but me and my wife family have eaten at the spotted cow on numerous occasions and its been generally ok especially for me being a vegetarian However today was nothing but lack lustre and was such a shame We simply were given the back seat treatment  It looks like the spotted cow needs some love and attention with a dash of passion of service to the consumer and to the pub itself  I hope your able to take my feedback with an open mind and through the eyes of the consumer as I really don t expect the above at somewhere like your pub and I wouldn t anywhere even a Toby carvery which you would probably find 
negative, the food is nothing like that served by the original Wetherby Whaler  In Whetherby surprisingly  It was so bad we left the food 
negative, In preparation for a concert at the Echo Arena on Saturday 10th December we booked a table at 10 00am online for 4 people at 6 00pm the same day The booking app worked perfectly and we received a confirmation number in seconds  We arrived at the restaurant at 5 25 35 mins AHEAD of table reservation  checked in with the front desk and were directed towards the very small bar area  The restaurant was very busy and also had a ridiculously and intrusively loud wedding in their upstairs function area You couldn t hear yourself think it was so loud  At 5 55 I went to the front desk and they gave me one of those flashing bleepers that alerts you that your table is ready  At 6 10pm I asked the front desk if my bleeper was functioning or not I was told that it was and 2 minutes and your table is ready  At 6 20pm I reapproached the same front desk and asked the same question and was given the same answer  At 6 30 I handed the bleeper back to the front desk and stated that we were disappointed and that we had to leave as we had a concert to attend and no longer had sufficient time to enjoy a restaurant meal  The managaress kindly offered us complimentary drinks at the bar after your concert  We could only reply that we really wanted eastZeast food not complimentary drinks at the bar  You d think that having booked a table and had it acknowledged & confirmed 6 hours in advance AND having turned up 35 mins in advance AND having attended the front desk ahead of time due that we would have had the chance to eat but not so hence the headline utter shambles  Cannot judge the food Only wish we could  
negative, We arrived around 4pm pub was relatively quiet and initial service pleasant and efficient We ordered two beef and one chicken roast dinners plus one risotto  which I have to say was ok  Food was served within a reasonable time however the beef on both dinners was really tough chicken was edible but the accompanying roast potatoes on all the plates were overcooked mash was lumpy and vegetables tasteless We were just about to complain about the beef when one of the staff came over to ask if everything was fine He was informed about the beef to which he said he would go and speak to the chef We assume he did but never came back to report anything to us By this time our three roast dinners were somewhat cold and very unappetising and most of the food was left on the plates and when the waitress came to clear she asked if we were satisfied Same story NO beef tough and inedible will tell chef no feedback from her  We decided not to have a sweet or any further drinks At the counter we asked for the bill and whether there would be any reduction for the poor quality of the beef The member of staff who took the first complaint was called and a discussion followed again I will ask the chef the answer was no chef had said that the beef was perfectly edible We paid the bill left our email address and phone number asked that the manager call us to register our complaint and left very unhappy  Tuesday 29th November I received a call from a person stating to be the manager I explained what had happened following which the person said that she would need to investigate with the staff members concerned and that she would call me back the following day I AM STILL AWAITING THAT CALL  Sadly we did not check trip advisor prior to going to the Cross Keys if we had we probable would not have gone It is difficult to judge reviews as everyone can have differing expectations of food quality I would have to say having experienced the poor quality of food lack of customer service and a manager who cannot manage a chef who seemingly is incapable of delivering basic dishes warm and edible that TERRIBLE is the only review I can give this establishment You have been warned   
negative, Went to this buffet with my girlfriend on the jubilee weekend thinking it might be a nice place to go having looked on their website I was wrong The food was awful and boardering unedable All of it was luke warm dry and completely tasteless with very little variety of dishes thaty didnt even go together There was loud dance music blasting your ear drums out which made it like trying to eat in a night club The waitresses were young but pleasant but the older woman behind the bar the manager i assume was abrupt and quite rude Overall this was by far the worst food i have ever had from a restuarant and would never even contemplate going back Where some of these people who have left good reviews have been eating i dont know but it couldnt of been here Given the luke warm temperatures of the food and questionable cleanliness of the venue i would have to say food poisoning is certainly possible If you eat here good luck 
negative, Waitresses we re friendly food was pretty bad Portions are not as described and prices are more than double what is expect to pay for the quality and portion sizes Two starters two mains 3 cokes 61 Got 50 off food as we were unhappy still 40 Had better food at pubs 
negative, If you want to taste poor food and service in an intimidating environment then this is the place for you  
negative, Tried to enjoy the annual Black Bull FREE music festival again this year but the only choice of real beer on tap was Hobgoblin 4 5 ABV  served in a Greene King IPA glass and even that had run out by the time I returned at 9 00pm OK I KNOW this wasn t a beer festival but come on is this a pub or what Even before I bought a drink I was asked to contribute my hard-earned as a donation to the acts I hadn t even seen yet - go figure 
negative,Well where to start To be honest I wouldn t bother visiting for dinner Table for 15 and we were placed in two tables not a great start as the upstairs restaurant was hardly busy Staff were nonchalant not really on task and this was reflected by drinks and courses arriving 15mins difference between our two tables This is a modern restaurant yet it was smokey from the kitchen yet it had ventilation system in place necessitating the windows to be opened to clear and then subjecting us to cold winds  Starters were acceptable Main courses were poor and very poor well done venison was bleeding blue fish was cold steaks were cold Fortunately we couldn t comment on the desserts they did appear quite appetising but as we left after the main choice then that is for some else to review 
negative,Waited half an hour for a table which we didn t mind We ordered our food and unfortunately we were sat by the service area where the food was prepared We waited for over an hour and no main course appeared we ended up leaving which i was glad we did as we had the misfortune as to see them plate the food No gloves used when plating the food  
negative, Staff were arrogant food was disgusting watery sauce and not cheap the food was tasteless and cold I would never eat here again 
negative, Have been eating out in and around SE London for quite some time There used to be a number of good Indian restaurants in Greenwich however now there is only the Mogul left in the centre  We ve been here a few times over the years and has only got worse  Downstairs is quite nice as a cellar restaurant good atmosphere The food is ok good however their chefs can t cook anything that isn t on the menu Most places can and often encourage it here it s a straight no That isn t a huge issue  However since we last went some months ago they ve put their prices up Again not by a lot and not a big issue  At the end of the meal we was given the bill when asked However we d noticed that there were no hot towels When asked the waiter said the owner had got rid of them to save money So the prices have gone up and now a small thing such as towels are removed To wash up after your meal you have to climb three sets of stairs to get to the WC Not ideal  With the bill also was served a few murray mints when we jokingly said where are the chocolates have they been cut too the waiter could only shrug  I don t mind prices going up and the menu being strict However when they cut other things that you d come to expect to save a few pennies per meal it really is a joke  We ve said we wouldn t go back last time we went there but some how managed to end up back there This time its a definite will never go back  
negative, Arrogant waiters who were completely disinterested in our table of 6 The Food was cold and tasteless 
negative, I assume that the Brasserie Blanc is part of a chain of restaurants so will be inevitably be restricted by blanket unmovable policies I had an awful meal at this restaurant and my five other friends said that it was only just passable I am a vegetarian and the choice of food was limited The waitress said that it was not possible to alter the meals in any way nor have a mix and match combination She declined my request to speak to a Manager to discuss my options on the grounds that they were far too busy So in the interests of politeness I just shut up and said no more My food was simply awful and I had no redress at all I would never set foot in a Raymond Blanc establishment again under any circumstances The carnivores in out group had a slightly better selection but none of us would go back   Clearly training for staff in good customer relations should be a priority for this restaurant  but then I would urge anyone who wants a special meal to look elsewhere in Cheltenham for a better culinary experience 
negative,Fantastic location good premises this should be the best pub in the area Visited recently after long absence and unfortunately it is being let down by bad or non existent management bar staff try hard enough but are slow and can t remember who s turn is next food orders taken but long waits real ale all tasted like brown bath water  it looked like every glass and plate used that day was still on the tables with food & mess everywhere Things not helped by agressive and offensive punters by the door scaring off normal folks One day someone will turn this place round and make a fortune but don t hold yer breath
negative, I visited Young s for a takeaway after having pleasant meals from there in the past  Unfortunately the standard has dropped dramatically My wife ordered what was her favourite BBQ spare ribs and chips whilst i ordered jumbo battered sausage and chips  The spare ribs were laughable Extremely overcooked whatever little meat was on them my wife had one rib and decided that it was pointless to even try to eat the rest  My evening was then spent throwing up being sick from the sausage It was either out of date or undercooked  Very disappointing as this place used to be very good We will be ordering from another Chinese in future  If i could give this zero stars i would 
negative, Went to Hussains again after a very bad curry years ago Still the same had chicken tikka balti only had four very small pieces of chicken bland taste and very expensive for what you get if you want a proper balti spark hill is the only place I will never eat in Hussains again going to the toilet also an experience 
negative, There are two Beehive Pubs in the city-centre of Liverpool This one in Paradise Street and the other one on Mount Pleasant I can t help thinking that some many of the reviews on here are mistaken for the other establishment especially the more positive submissions Before the Liverpool One shopping complex was built this pub served mainly the local-regulars Scousers  Since L1 arrived things changed considerably Prices sky-rocketed and the quality of the beer descended The pint of lager I had in there recently was probably one of the most expensive served in a Liverpool pub and of the poorest quality It is obvious that most customers are now not of the area are tourists and this is the client-base that the pub now seemingly wishes to exploit  I was dumbfounded to see they had a kitchenette serving food  but with toilets that were in an extremely poor state sodden and dirty - surely there must be a hygiene certification issue here 
negative, we went for our firms christmas do so over crowded over booked we was seated in the extention area which was freezing cold  the food was poor quailty and badly cooked served on all odds and sods of crockery and cutlery the music was so loud you could not hear the person sitting next to you  All in all a terrible evening avoid at all costs if you want a pleasant evening unless your a youngster that likes head banging noise all night 
negative, Despite a cheerful waitress who managed to seat us the experience lacked any credible value for most of the food It was well overpriced by far and represented very poor value for the cost such as 11 95 for the roast  6 50 for a one piece of toast pate The fish platter was reasonable at 10 95 but 6 chips in a cup at 3 50 was also a rip-off Apart from being overcharged by a spurious 1 40 the Sunday wait of more than an hour between starter and main course was a poor do Laycock needs to offer acceptable standards of value against cost Other establishments in poorer parts of the country do far better so it can be done It s unfortunate that such an experience always catches the tourist in this case would not return 
negative,Went to bills on Monday for the first time after hearing many good things We were told as we approached the table that there was no fish at all as the delivery wasn t turning up until the afternoon With a tescos right next door I would have thought an emergency shop would have been plausible- especially as the lack of fish left the set menu with only chicken skewers or a veg option unless you were happy to pay a 5 supplement for a steak  Service was very rushed- the girl tries to run off when serving drinks despite us wanting to order we had to ask her to come back The food we had was good which was just as well as no-one came to ask how it was The experience was topped off with a 10 service charge added onto the bill- for what service We also thought it was strange that there no Xmas decorations December 1st  although the decor itself is nice 
negative, My lunch last Saturday in The Gardeners Arms - Ardingly was terrible We both ordered the Steak and Ale pie and when it arrived it was pretty obvious that the pastry was overcooked It made a sound like an over-tightened drum when I tapped it with fork After several attempts I eventually penetrated the pastry which reminded me of chiselled pieces of sandstone I did try a small piece of pie which nearly broke my tooth  The replacement chicken salad consisted of six small pieces of processed chicken divided between the two plates Everything mostly lettuce leaves was drowning in mayo Never again 
negative, Visited this bar last night after a nice meal in Chelsea I have to be honest I have never experienced such rudeness & bad service Ordered two drinks at bar with female bar member not rocket science JD & coke vodka soda & slice of lime Instead of soda we got lemonade no big deal you would think Took drink back to bar to get changed only to be met with refusal to change drink and the comment if you had asked for soda I would have served soda bar staff turned her back on me & refused to acknowledge me At this point I had to speak to a further two members of staff to speak to the manager when he had time looked at me in disgust tasted the drink changed it but did not say one word to me - talk about great service Avoid at all costs 
negative, We are totally disgusted with our Christmas dinner and we will not be going back ever again My mother who is now 76 years old was so much looking forward to the meal However the whole experience was diabolical  Below are our complaints  Not given the table we requested when ordering in September Instead the five of us were squeezed onto two small tables pushed together  Everything tasted bland Vegetables not cooked and were hard Food was barely warm No difference between boiled and roast potatoes Some roast potatoes were the size of a nut burnt to a crisp Turkey was watery Gravy was watery Christmas pudding was the size of a desert spoon and cooked in the microwave Not enough portions small amount of custard was used instead of brandy sauce Coffee was half filled in cups Waiting 20 minutes between meals  It wasn t only the food that was very bad but the whole festive atmosphere was non existent with two distracting TVs hardly any decorations and we couldn t see a Christmas tree Before going we envisaged a lovely atmosphere with carols in the background We all left behind Christmas cards with free offers to entice us back again We wouldn t go back if it was free This cost us 250 and it was nothing but a ruined heart breaking Christmas day 
negative, Tried to order home delivery twice and had order declined both times Delivery is advertised in my area 0 out of 10 for customer service Will not be using again 
negative, Have been to Bills in both Worcester and Leamington Spa - and that is the last time I shall use them  Visited the Leamington Spa branch a few months ago and there were issues - a medium steak sent back because it was very rare nothing worse than eating your re-served dinner when everyone else has finished - and the toilets absolutely stank Must admit that they did take the cost of the steak of the bill Have just revisited Bills in Leam Spa expecting the toilet smell to be resolved - but it wasn t  Also whilst the food service and d€÷cor were very good what I failed to notice until this morning whilst checking my receipts was that a 10 service charge was added to my bill I honestly never check my bill - something I will not fail to do so in the future - but I would expect to be informed of this and not just by the small print on the bill  To make it worse I also leave a tip when I get good service as found here  Just checked the menu etc on their website and there is no mention of this service charge  To summarise - don t go to Bills because the toilets stink and there is an underhand 10 service charge 
negative, First of all the guy on the till taking the orders Kelly according to the receipt needs to learn how to crack a smile Service can only be described as slow A couple of burgers and a jacket potato shouldn t take 35 minutes to arrive And you shouldn t have to chase up your cutlery and when they deliver it they need to learn how to count  They managed to mess up the burgers putting both ordered extras on one of them instead of one on each The waitress did sort that out effectively though  Burger was Angus beef Nice flavour but dry and chewy At a guess I d say the cow had just walked all the way from Aberdeen come to think of it that may explain the delay in it arriving too  Coleslaw was dry and tasteless  The missus did enjoy her jacket potato so not a total disaster but a cafe at a popular tourist attraction like this needs to be able to do better than baking an ok potato  
negative,Had a chicken curry and fried rice Curry was very bland and fairly tasteless with a stodgy rice expected something better for the money I paid to be honest If I hadn t had so far to walk I would have taken it back
negative,Although there were plenty of available tables we were told to sit in the corridor as a previous reviewer also stated  Miraculously when we challenged them a table was instantly found  The bar staff were nice enough However the famous carvery was atrocious What appeared to be bought in pre-carved meat was cold The limited vegetables were dry and tasteless The gravy was like dishwater The roast potatoes were over cooked and no mash We have eaten the length and breadth of the country but by far this was our worst culinary experience Maybe we should have inspected the food before ordering our carvery This is the first poor review I ve been compelled to write The Ship looks great from the outside but we will not be returning
negative,Bland food Sausage and mash-sausage seemed meat free just seemed to be cereal based Mash tasted like Smash When I complained they said the sausages are bog standard  mmm nice why sell em then and we re having problems finding a good butcher -really Lots of them around They also claimed that the mash was made with butter and cream Well could have been Smash made with butter and cream to disguise the Smash My wife s quiche was ok but the salad was puny and undressed We only ate the meals because we were hungry  The guest beer was ok but we won t be back 
negative,A terrible place to eat but this seems to apply to all Pizza Hut resaurants lately The pizzas are truly bad and not worth the money the service is verging on the non-existant on two seperate visits at least one person in our party didn t get any food at all Steer well clear 
negative, Every now and again even the reliable let you down Yo Sushi is pretty much a given for quality and cleanliness no matter where you find one the cuisine may be an acquired taste for some but my partner and I always find it the near perfect stop off for lunches So on finding one very far below what can be expected from this chain restaurant makes the disappointment even harder to take On a lovely Sunday trip to the beautiful city of Oxford we had planned to meet a friend in Yo Sushi for lunch and after an early start to the day we arrived as planned at midday Shown our table swiftly and by a smiling staff member all at first seemed well it did not last Problem one a strange smell throughout the restaurant and not the pleasant aromas of food either It was not a cleaning material smell nor was it a toilet smell but it was very unpleasant and always in the background We chatted and decided on our hot orders and helped ourselves to a couple of dishes from the belt and fairly soon my first and then my second hot dish arrived not till had finished mine and for some time after did my partner s arrive then she had finished hrs long before our friends arrived There is nothing worse than going out to dinner with friends and all eating alone Then came another disappointment the food was bland bordering on tasteless I adore the Beef an Garlic Teriyaki at least I did no slight crunch t the bite and no hint of spice and it was the same for all our dishes nothing it seemed was up to the normal Yo Sushi standard And all the time we ate chefs appeared alongside our table and yelled orders at the tops of their voices annoying to say the least hard to hold a conversation and totally spoiling what little atmosphere there was in this store We had only been there half and hour or so and yet when I went to the gents there was no toilet paper similar was reported by my partner when she returned from a visit to the ladies where she discovered only a couple of squares left  The biggest shock though was the disgusting sink alongside where we sat this is where they cleared the dishes to after customers had eaten and at times dirty bowls were piled high I was then glad I had not ordered wine as I watched in horror as our waitress picked u a J-Cloth from the back of the sink and used it to wipe out four wine glasses I thought maybe that she was just going to wipe out there residue from used glasses before transferring them to the wash-up area But then she poured wine into them after being wiped with the dish rag in an area right alongside the sink full of cleared bowls Those wines were then delivered to unsuspecting customers Disgusting does not even come close to describing this practice Enough was enough and we pressed the button to call a staff member so we could pay our bill we waited stood put on our coats cleared it and pressed the button two more times Staff looked as if they were heading to us but then put more bowls in the sink and ignored us Seven times we pressed the button it took longer to get our bill than it di to get our food and we had to wait for that to be served I was very close to walking out without paying I became so fed up with waiting On complaining to the manager I was told  It s Sunday We are busy  It was as if they had opened unprepared for a busy day of service on a weekend This did nothing to relieve my disappointment but he did knock our tap water off the bill very generous Yo Sushi Oxford sort yourselves out  
negative, Ordered a delivery when it arrived order was wrong the girl on the phone was just pure rude also ordered a chicken shish and salad and I bet there was not even a full chicken brest and that was 6 rip off 
negative, We had just been to the science museum and decided to walk down to South Kensington to get a drink we were lured in by the best bar awards plastered all over the outside of this pub Don t be fooled I do not know how these awards were achieved For 11 a cocktail you would expect fresh fruit and actually be able to taste the alcohol even at that it would be expensive I m pretty sure the bar man poured a fruit shoot into my thimble sized glass   horrible and sickly Will not be returning 
negative, Went here for some food after the pictures and how sorry we were Greeted by staff who just didn t want to be there at all We waited about 40 minutes for food that when it came I wish they had turned the dial on the microwave down just one notch  I could see the chef in the kitchen ripping open the packets of the food to serve up to people Tasted awful Only saving grace was that I found a voucher online whilst sitting WAITING for my food which knocked 2 3 off the bill  
negative,Cheap - yes cheerful - not really quality - nope  This place is awful which is probably why you have to pay in cash before you see their offerings Whilst I ve been to cheap buffet all-you-can-eat style Chinese restaurants in the past they tend to offer something that will pass as food  Tepid dishwater soup that looks like it has been there for a week tasteless watered down sauces and battered thingies with more batter than thingy This has been done as cheap as possible compromising at every opportunity  I can only imagine that this place stays open through footfall from the train station rather than repeat custom as I can t believe anyone would return 
negative, Hadn t tried this restaurant before so went there today for lunch Arrived at 1215 to find outer door locked Went in via hotel reception only to be told that the restaurant was closed due to a heavy morning and people coming in late for breakfast  That is really not an acceptable excuse for an hotel We did not have time to wait around so went elsewhere 
negative, Food was very slow to come out when it did it was awful the mushrooms were swimming in juice but somehow were really chewy Sausages cremated the Bacon was extremely salty we were thirsty for hours  plates dirty a lady in front of me had to sort through 10 plates before finding one close enough to clean and had to use a napkin to clean it further  so as not to give a totally negative review the Yorkshire pudding was nice and crispy as advertised and the staff were polite and helpful 
negative,We were not allowed in to this establishment on a Wednesday evening because we were a party of 8 They were not full We had been for an excellent meal at Dejavu in Kendal and wanted a drink before setting off home We ended up in Ruskins bar where we had an excellent time They had an open mic night and the performers sang Happy Birthday and then improvised a personal song for our Birthday girl  Subsequently found out that my son and his wife and child had not been allowed in on a previous occasion Seems to be a very limited demographic Paloma s are after 
negative,As a family of 4 we decided to have a long walk around the stunning Woburn grounds and then head for some tea and cake afterwards We walked into this small and dated tea room and were placed in a corner table We had no menus and had to rummage around to find some There were electronic service buttons on the tables but they were obviously broken as we pressed them during our long wait for someone to come and serve us After about 10 mins a group of people came in and had the same unfriendly welcome that we had At this point we decided to move on What really annoyed me was the opening text in the menu that talked about the amazing atmosphere What a load of rubbish Woburn needs a normally priced tea room but this is not it 
negative, I went here with my girlfriend for tea and coffee As I stood at the bar I could see people getting alcohol to my left and hot drinks to the right I chose the que the the right The Irishman making the drinks had his back to me for 15 minuets He then turned round and shouted 4 cappuccinos to which I asked if I could place my order He replied I don t take the orders you need to go to the bar and join the line behind this lot With an attitude like this I m amazed Weatherspoons let this man loose with hot water because he is incapable of working a till or customer services Get rid of him 
negative,My wife and I popped in here last for a quick pizza for lunch but were sorry we did there were only an handful of people eating there so I would have expected a good service but we didn t get it The waiter appeared to be in a hurry and gave the impression that he was annoyed when we didn t order a starter We waited a while before our pizzas arrived and when they did they were burnt We didn t even bother to complain mostly because the waiter did his best to avoid us and also because we didn t have time to wait another 15 20 mins for another pizza Surely the person making the pizza should check them before they are served - not a difficult thing to do This is the first time I have left a restaurant without leaving a tip I have eaten here before when it was full without any issue 
negative, one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to The meat from the kebab is so fatty I ended up throwing it away Even the condiments added with it were disgusting Ended up going to woodys grill in acton instead and threw this rubbish away Oily and raw at the same time I kept on hearing a microwave ping sound and the staff were arguing 
negative, Ordered fish chips and peas Peas came in a thimble size container Fish portion not very big or nice chips were good but very few Not value for money 
negative, Dirty Rundown Poor Expensive Food Don t go ever it was so bad Greasy Burnt Poor Quality Food Bread was older than the wine it really was so stale it was unedable 
negative, 1 We ordered a set meal for 3 but received the same food as the table next to us who had a set meal for 2 - effectively we gave 13 for nothing 2 The waiters was literally taking our plates away as we finished - he later told us we had to leave we were only there for just over 30 minutes  3 He later insisted on a 6 service charge and again ordered us to leave The bill was non itemised so some people may ending up tipping twice The food was good and the manager agreed eventually to give us our service charge back We still paid 45+ for a very disappointing experience 
negative, I loved the 1980 s and last night I revisited it by eating at this place It s been many years since I ve eaten Indian food that s so bad To name just a few things NO TANDORI NO MIXED GRILL NO BOMBAY POTATO NO EGG FRIED RICE NO SHASHLICK NO CLAY OVEN NO KEEMA RICE OR NAAN NO DRAUGHT BEERS in fact I don t believe this was a real restaurant All food served on mismatched plates no service ware or skillets not even a plate for the naan s Just served together so we didn t know which was which on an old dirty straw mat covered with a towel someone call health and safety lol I could go on but in fairness it was so awful we actually had a good time we ended up laughing so much at how awful it was it made the night quite a experience So in all not sure where all there gleeming reviews come from Maybe themselves But if your enjoy authentic Indian cuisine this is not the place to go As one positive the service staff were very nice 
negative, I took a client there for a bite to eat at lunch time waited 10 minutes in single file at the bar & eventually ordered burgers with salad Waited another 45 minutes no food asked at the bar and was told it was just being plated up  Food turned up minutes later still The burgers were cold & stiff and looked as if they had been cooked the day before Late back to work Go somewhere else   
negative, The food was truly awful and while the waiting staff were concerned the manager didn t care at all The pizza was cold the prawns and mussels were tiny frozen and tasteless The linguini was very average Avoid this place Complete waste of money 
negative,From the claims made for it on its website I was expecting a good dining experience at Brasserie 103 but came away really disappointed The place lacks the sophistication claimed for it it noisy to the extent that conversation is nigh impossible and the service is desperately poor We waited 45 minutes for the starters and another 50 minutes for the main courses and the serving staff showed no interest in us or as to whether we enjoyed our meal or apologised for the delays The food is dreadfully mediocre and in no way matches the claims the Brasserie makes for itself and the prices are way out of line with the quality of the ingredients or the cooking  16 90 for a very poor dry Chicken Katsu Curry was pretty disgraceful 
negative, Awful food experience My wife had a steak pit that was dried up like it had been under a hot plate all day I order a Cumberland sausage with chump potatoes veg and Yorkshire pudding What arrived was a very average sausage chips and burnt Yorkshire pudding Refund was so instant it had a feeling of regularity about it Avoid Went to the Boot Inn the following night which was lovely 
negative, We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at the restaurant with family I advised the restaurant what the occasion was prior to the evening We arrived and sat at the table at the rear of the restaurant where a screen shields the kitchen and toilets but also restricts movement around the seats against the wall We were not offered a drink on arrival or indeed for 20 minutes  even after I had to rush to request a glass of water because my wife began choking on a breadstick We were eventually offered drinks which arrived but were incorrect We were then handed a menu   well 4 menu s between 9 people  We then asked for butter because our children wanted to eat this with the bread that arrived The butter came on a side plate along with just 3 side plates between 9 people Due to the occasion I reined in my initial concern and didn t mention anything The main courses arrived after we had to remind the staff that our glasses were all empty Due to the position of the table the staff couldn t circulate the table Thus most of the plates were passed over the heads of guests One plate arrived with a long blond hair hanging from a plate of pasta and was immediately sent back One meal didn t arrive at all until I complained The final meal was then passed across the heads of guests to my 11 year old daughter who had it placed in the palm of her hand The bottom of the plate was hot due to hot food being on it This resulted in her jerking to get the plate on to the table and knocking over her drink  something our young lady waitress thought was highly amusing  At this point I admit I lost it  As did my wife as the young waitress couldn t understand what the problem was and 2 senior staff attempted to placate me as I ranted about the disastrous evening What made matters worse was that the staff then tried to excuse the events by stating how am I supposed to get the plate to her then and sorry but the owner went on holiday yesterday  Eventually they apologised and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and reduced the final bill but I have to say that I will never go back Neither will my family This was an occasion that we will only do once and I m afraid they ruined it 
negative,Will keep this brief food was terrible and the landlady was very rude and in your face never again 
negative,I am not one to usually write reviews feedback however my experience food wise was so poor that i was prompted to do so This review was meant for the Tastecard website as i am a member however unfortunately they proof read all reviews to ensure they are only positive Therefore not giving a true and honest reflection of an establishment and are only to serve themselves and it s members but that s business hey Moving swiftly on Hardly anything from this establishment was authentic American food from what i had sampled between a few people attending with me Put simply this is a poor attempt at American food from Greek owners which feel the need to add a Greek twist to food which should not be tampered with Pretty much all the food was bland and flavourless that included the jalape€¤os which was a first for me  I personally believe that is due to poor quality of ingredients across the menu as well a lack of knowledge for something as simple as American food What ever you do stay away from the chilli dog you have been warned  I had the frankfurter and it was a throw back to school dinners and when food standards were at a very low It consisted of mechanically separated meat with some kind of Mediterranean meat mixture which i refuse to call chilli as it was far from No heat no flavour all sitting on an over cooked hot dog bun not pleasant in the slightest The inferno chicken wings was in fact just chicken wings tossed in sweet chilli sauce A lot of false advertisement When highlighted to the waitress she was clueless not sure if that was just for the issue of the wings or something more general to her persona  On the up side the ribs were not to bad and the service was just about acceptable then again it was pretty much empty Had it not been for hunger pains and my stomach having an aggressive conversation with me i would had ditched my meal after the first bite and in hindsight should had yes i live a life of regrets this was definitely one of them  One of the main from the many questions i left with from this place was why on earth is everything garnished with coriander That truly is a riddle for me maybe it is a new American thing i do not know about As i have never seen that in all my years Probably that Greek twist i mentioned previously there should be rules in fact laws against such acts Summing up if you are after real American food hit one of the well known chains i e TGI s or even Mc Donald s or Burger King yes  they even do it better even from that lower end  or just anywhere with half decent food this place is not even worth it with 50 off with Tastecard Well and truly Avoid Don t just take my word everyone else on here has got it spot on Just goes to show anyone thinking about opening up a restaurant should have faith and this place should be their Mecca that you can make it If these guys can open and somehow remain opened surely anyone one Thought I d leave on a positive note for all you budding entrepreneurs 
negative, Every Monday myself and my Fiancee eat out usually but not always at Nandos This week as a perk my company gave me a free trial of Tastecard which gives amazing discounts at restaurants Looking at the list of participating restaurants I noticed that Tarrantinos gave a 50 discount to cardholders so I booked  When we arrived only 2 other tables were taken which should have rang alarm bells For Starters we ordered Sardines and Ribs respectively Both were ok if nothing special although the ribs were absolutely smothered in barbecue sauce By this time we were the only diners left  The problem came in the shape of our main course 2 lasagnes  Both were burnt a little on top which I could have forgiven but the pasta and cheese were like rubber and shockingly for a supposed authentic Italian restaurant the taste was totally bland we ended up leaving most of it and even now several hours later I m still feeling bloated My fianc€÷e swears that these were leftover from lunchtime or even yesterday and unfortunately I think she could be right Thankfully the Tastcard discount of 18 reduced our bill to 24 because if I begrudged paying 24 I would have thrown my toys out of the pram big time if I had got a bill for 42  I won t be going back to Tarrantinos anytime soon 
negative, What s the world coming to when the humble burger can command such ridiculous prices Fans of this place must have been raised on Pot Noodles and Monster Munch if they think this is good food What a joke 
negative, Went here with a group of friends on our lunch break with limited time the service was very slow and we had to try get someone s attention more than once for the bill The menu is very limited the salads that we ordered we very very plain as was the fish pie tasteless and bland If your after lunch I would to any of the other great places in soho 
negative, What a dump Not clean not tidy no menus on tables not much choice 30 minute wait for food There wasn t a single good thing about this place 
negative,i had booked a meal here for family we were meeting sunday night by chance we called in on thursday night for a cocktail so glad i did not a place to sit down and talk at a meal dim lights loud awful music and brash staff overprice drinks with a 12 5 service charge stay well clear shocked this was part of the hilton 
negative,If you are planning to attend a performance at Nottingham Playhouse for goodness sake don t eat in their Cast restaurant beforehand We were a party of 24 and all the booking arrangements and menu choices had been notified in advance Most of us arrived at 6 00 pm as requested one small group being perhaps five minutes late When the starters had not arrived 50 minutes later I spoke to the Duty Manager and insisted that these should be served They did then arrive but there was no sign of our main courses until we had made a further protest These were served at 7 20 80 minutes after our arrival and because the performance time was fast approaching we had to rush our food and did not have time to enjoy it properly Indeed several of our party had to leave their portions unfinished in order to move into the theatre before curtain up We had no time to use the conveniences or purchase a programme and the enjoyment of the evening was significantly diminished Eventually we were served our puddings in the interval at 9 15  The Duty Manager could not seem to offer any excuse or explanation and it was not as if many other customers were in the restaurant hardly surprising  I have pointed out to the Playhouse that our society makes an annual theatre visit and that the income from the group would have been nearly 1000 One would have thought that the theatre would have been glad of this revenue and would seek to ensure that we returned in a future year This will certainly not be the case 
negative, Arrived at 7 45pm by 10 10pm only the starter had arrived Chicken Jalfrezi was like chicken in tomato sauce Drink service was slow and even though we had pre ordered the food we had to order twice more before it eventually arrived We won t be going there again On the positive side the Elvis singer was a good laugh and he made the night more bearable 
negative,Been visiting this place for many years Just come back from the worst meal either of us have ever had Both had the roast - which we seem to think was this frozen sliced stuff Potatoes also frozen and vegetables hard and cold Portions much smaller than usual No staff around to mention anything to - when we left three of them were stood around the bar and not even so much as a goodbye or thank you Tables next to us were also left with plates on with large amounts of food on Won t be back despite their e-mails regarding your wonderful new menu Very very disappointed 
negative, We have been going to this restaurant for years but there has been a recent gap of about 18 months - what a decline in food quality - service is still OK though We ordered a bottle of wine which they did not have - a mid price red - next step up was almost 10 more is this a ploy to make you spend more to get a decent red over 12 ABV I ordered a sirloin with peppercorn sauce which used to be excellent - 15 mins later advised no sirloin but they did have fillet  is there a theme developing here  My wife ordered the avocado dish as a starter - it was top of the specials board 20 mins later advised they had run out What is going on I had the smoked fish platter - they used to do a very similar platter which was excellent This had an odour of dirty damp carpets was tasteless and served with what might once have been tartare sauce and what I think was a Marie rose sauce - it had gone pale brown and turned in to a gloopy jelly like substance The pizza was OK - the medium rare filet steak was almost well done - the potatoes that came with it were hard and very much undercooked We did not stay for desert The staff knew it was a car crash and took 20 of the bill without being asked - so they clearly know how bad the food was The chef sits on the bottom of the stairs to the toilet and smokes inside the building This used to be such a great good value restaurant in the heart of London and could be again with a bit of attention and some basic discipline - We won t be going back to see if it improves 
negative, My partner and I decided to try Chianti having heard a good review from family and thought we would give it a go   On arrival on a dark Sunday afternoon we drove round to the rear of the restaurant to park the car There were no lights on the car park and the restaurant is not in one of the better areas of Bolton shall we say On leaving the car the lights were on obviously in the eatery and all looked rather promising  Having not booked we expected to be offered a table when one came available - the place was less than half full and tables were emptying as we entered - but we were not even offered to be able to wait The time was around 5 30PM and we were asked to come back at 8PM for a table Now call me old fashioned but businesses - especially new ones -should always welcome new customers not turn them away  We turned around and went over the hill into Horwich to one of our regular late Sunday afternoon restaurants that made us instantly welcome even though they had fewer tables available  Not a very good way to treatment customers and as I and my family are the type as many are last minute people we will not be trying this place out in the near future  Go over the hill to Horwich for good food great service and welcoming staff 
negative,We went to Musa for afternoon tea The service was appalling The staff at the counter could have not be more rude and inefficient We had to wait almost half an hour despite being one of only two tables there Then ten more minutes for a fork and napkin which should have been given to us when serving cakes All the tables around us were cluttered with dirty crockery whilst a waiter and waitress were chatting by the coffee machine We shall not stop at the cafe next time we visit Firstsite It s an insult to such a beautiful gallery 
negative, First impression from staff greeting us was that it was a bit of an imposition for us to ask for a table as we had not pre-booked A filthy sticky table was found facing a wall not conducive to a pleasant dining experience Other tables were available throughout perhaps we should have been less British and demanded a better table The food arrived overcooked The Medium rare steak arrived well done this was only the second time I have ever sent food back the replacement steak should have perhaps been the third but hunger overtook We were asked for our dessert order but asked for a couple of minutes more which was our mistake as despite waiting a further 15 - 20 minutes and the trying to catch the waiters eye we eventually gave up settled our bill at the bar and went to McDonalds for dessert instead speaks for itself really  Not all of the staff were dreadful there was one exception a lady who we took to be the manageress She was very polite seemed to care about the customers offered a free dessert or a pint as compensation for the poorly cooked steak Unfortunately 1 good apple doesn t make up for the remainder of the staff and the experience 
negative, Where does one start My first visit here On arrival a large queue for drinks most delayed by cocktail making far too few bar staff no idea of surge capacity - perhaps a shock to have several customers on a Thursday at 1900 When I did reach the front customers arriving later were offered bar service first even though it was obvious I had been waiting some time and there was no apology or recognition of a delay The staff could hardly be described as welcoming Either I was temporarily invisible or the bar staff found it more convenient to serve someone else Certainly these comments are not one-off  as recent reviewers have also reported Turning to the food this was over half an hour late from the booking time warm at best Did not consider it worth a further wait to ask for it to be heated again and one would suspect the reason for the delay is a commercial one - so that more money can be spent at the bar I ate one main course - I was hungry by his time but after this still needed food at home later The salad was very much weighted for cheap ingredients apart from a few too few pieces of Avocado on top The turkey tasted like it had been reconstituted with a striped grill effect not at all appetising This establishment appears to have taken at best a short-term view of customer service and has no concept of effective time management I would not recommend this for anything other than the two for one cocktails which did appear to offer value for money although in the interests of time I did not partake I would not recommend the food A Michelin star is a long way away not that this would be their target and as other correspondents have reported there are far more establishments offering better overall value for money nearby Several of my co-diners also found it difficult to digest their entire plate of food as for example burgers were less than hot  Finally reflecting the title of this summary what on earth is the incentive to return 
negative, The bar staff are only interested in one thing here and that`s looking busy or just standing around making excuses not to serve you  I am busy  when they are clearly not appears to be the In  statement I could add a lot more to this like food served on cold plates people ordering coffee being more of a priority but there is no point as I have decided never to visit there again I shall go elsewhere and get treated like a customer and not just an interuption 
negative, Not sure what was going on at this place - we stopped by when staying at Dunsandles and were not impressed It has been recommended by the owners and well we were sorry to have listened to his advice The food was as if it was out of tins or a microwave 
negative, My elderly parents went to the New Brighton La Tasca tonight to celebrate my mothers 68th birthday they are both in bad health and do not get out much After waiting 20 minutes for any service my mother went to find a member of staff so they could order a drink A spanish waiter arrived and told them that they only had one type of beer on and when they asked if there was no other lager they were told to go somewhere else This upset my mother so much she had to come home and it has thoroughly spoilt her whole birthday At her age she will not have many birthdays left and this one was ruined by a very rude member of staff I could appreciate that they were busy and could be excused for the delay in table service but not for the lack of customer service or for the rude attitude I have taught licensing law for the past 15 years so i understand the trade and the pressure of a busy service but this behaviour is unacceptable please could something be done so that somebody else s celebration will not be ruined by rude staff 
negative, WE went to the Argosy with our son and daughter in law for a meal and a catch up which should have been an enjoyable experience My son and I ordered a half a chicken with barbecue sauce which came with chips and coleslaw - when the chicken arrived it looked like roadkill - almost like a pancake and certainly unrecognisable as half a chicken in any way shape or form I suppose the barbeque sauce was o k  but the meagre portion of chips was a disgrace My wife had a vegetarian curry this appeared to be nearly all hard cauliflower and was served in an oblong white enamel dish although the poppadums were nice and crispy - the bhagees were practically tiny scraps Even one of the servers dropped one of the meals on the floor which meant we had to let our meals go cold whils a fresh meal was prepared to replace the dropped one I certainly would not advise anyone to eat there if they wanted a decent quality meal I certainly will not step across their door again  Only one word for the experience disgusting  
negative, Arrived on Saturday around 18 30 with only 7 other cars in the car park plenty of space for us to park as all other pubs nearby on that main road seemed to be with busy car parks Maybe that should have told us something No one was stood at the bar but us the barman just looked at us and did nt speak we asked a young waitress for a table for two she said they was fully booked The place was not even quarter full Not all tables had reserved on them This is just a place who only want locals in and we noticed when passing earlier in the day they appeared to be of the retirement generation in suits and ties Be careful when leaving the car park its a bit of a blind spot diificult to see on-coming fast traffic from both directions 
negative, After complaining about Sea Food platter I was delighted NOT to receive a 46 service charge for a meal for 6 Food rating poor  Toilets upstairs in need of cleaning and modernising Didn t pay service charge and will never eat there again  
negative, Having known and visited this restaurant for more than 20 years mostly enjoying our meals it has now become very unreliable The last few visits have each been worse than the previous culminating in this evenings terrible dinner  Lobster their speciality not freshly cooked as it arrived within 10 minutes of ordering and was dry and flavourless  Fries were cold and had to be replaced Salad limp and without proper dressing Beer was their own brew and instantly made me feel ill  All in all a rotten experience and after literally dozens of visits I m not ever going back Shame as this was one of the best and was in my opinion an iconic restaurant serving the best ribs and sea food New owner maybe 
negative, I am always confused when you arrive at a restaurant that is about 5 full to be told there are no tables because they are all reserved At best this means the duty manager hasn t a clue about how to run a profitable shift at worst it implies you should go somewhere else The message tonight carried both those meanings and I wish we had heeded the warning signs Alas we sat at the unwiped tables in the bar canteen area and ate poorly presented average meals that make the offer at your local Wetherspoon simply astonishing by comparison Albeit the children s meal deals represent reasonable value As for the food the steak was cooked to spec but let down by overcooked chips soggy onion rings and the decision to serve it in a pasta bowl steak must always be served on a plate large enough for it to sit properly  The chicken burger bun was a breakfast bap and the cos lettuce plain wrong  Other than the lack of welcome from the host duty manager the staff were friendly The barman was accommodating when I asked him to remove the sparkler from the ale the selection Greene King IPA and a rebadged version of the same was as poor as ever at these types of GK owned places   With a destination diner the welcome is everything and when that is poor then the shortcomings in the food quality and cleanliness can be as stark as the lighting in the bar area  Unsurprisingly about 95 of the tables remained as empty when we left as they were when we arrived and the statement that all tables were reserved is not something I suspect to be the case at this disappointing pub in future  Not worth stopping off for go into Stratford would not go back or recommend at all 
negative, First time we ve eaten here and was sadly disappointed Nice location sat outside enjoying the rare sunshine I ordered the calamari to start with a mushroom risotto as a main and my wife a straightforward spicy pizza Unfortunately my calamari basically tasted of flour and the risotto was undercooked to the point I couldn t eat it after few mouthfuls They took it back and offered a different choice but we decided to instead share the pizza This turned out to be very doughy and lacking in flavour They took the risotto off the bill which was fair enough but personally I rather pay and eat decent food Not sure we ll try the place again 
negative, This is the second review for this place and was hoping to give a better one  we got a cheese panini - what we actually got was a crunchy bread very very crunchy not enjoyable at all with tomato and a splash of cheese    i know its cheap but i found it cold and inadequate  you complain and get sorry no customer service and miserable faces   breakfasts are good but dinners not so   
negative, We decided to book the Plough and Harrow for a family meal on a Sunday evening When we arrived i was quite surprised to see a big banner with the word Passion written on it we passed the kitchen door and looked in to see a tray of chips on the floor Our table was ready and we ordered drinks and also our food What a disappointment The food was terrible I had garlic bread which tasted of mould and my pasta had no sauce Chips were in short supply with adults receiving between 4 and 8 chips We were told we had to leave at 9 p m as they had a rule that it was adults only after that but did not tell us this when we booked the table so two people had to leave without finishing their meals or drinks As we were the only people in the pub it seems quite unlikely they were expecting a last minute rush We would never return 
negative, I recently went to the Kitchen and Pantry for a quick lunch during a Portobello Rd shopping trip we choose this place because it looked nice enough and the prices seemed ok  But even considering the reasonable prices for food drinks are expensive the quality was really disappointing We both had jacket potatoes and my girlfriend s mixed veg and cheese looked worse than an 90 s school dinner The veg in particular seemed to have been dumped straight out of a mixed frozen veg pack and microwaved for a good hour to make sure all the nutrients and flavor had been exterminated Unfortunately the veg must have taken up all the mircowave space because my chilli con carne version was stone cold and pretty much tasteless even when returned hot  Service was slow and while some of the staff were lovely others looked less than pleased to be interacting with customers  Even ordering at the front desk felt like a military operation - In particular when I asked for sweet potato jackets I was told they had just run out but when my girlfriend s lunch arrived a normal potato I was told they had just run out of normal potatoes so would I mind having a sweet potato  So we took it in turns to eat lunch because of the delay to my meal  Portobello Rd has loads of cafes and street food stalls I d recommend trying any of them before this place 
negative, Went for lunch - looked really good nice menu Had to sit inside due to the amount of people smoking outside  Found a table we liked then had to search for a menu Chose our meal went to the bar to order it and was totally ignored for 10 minutes With several people serving we thought it should be quick Wrong Others came came in got served ordered there food and left  I can only imagine that this a general way of treating people and that their food is a similar low standard  
negative, Stayed at the Red Dragon for 2 nights Room was small basic but adequate No shower & no curtain on the bathroom window which was not frosted glass so it was open viewing to the building opposite across the narrow street Decided to use the communal bath shower room but shower did not work & no curtain on that window either We decided to have our evening meal here on the 1st night as the bar area looked very nice & oldey worldy We ordered the Cock & Bull The presentation was not very good when it arrived meat was tough & had little taste so when asked how our meal was we said that it was not satisfactory & so had a refund on only one of the meals  At the end of our stay & when paying the final bill we noticed we had been charged for 4 breakfasts for the 2 nights we stayed even though we did not request them and on their sales card it stated that without breakfast the bill would be reduced by 5 per person for each nights stay We were not asked about this during our stay and things were not made clear to us I got the impression it was because we complained about the previous evenings meal 
negative, I would strongly not recommend this place to eat with friends family or business associates  The service is pitiful staff unobservant and there are a plethora of other places that are better We were handed menus over the bar having asked if we could eat even though e had booked a table The service was slow and the pub was not even busy In addition to this we had to continually get up and ask the staff to stop talking as we were needing service - we were then told that there was an issue with the rota and that this is very important - i suppose this was more important than paying customers Please if nothing else take heed of the advice of not eating here - there are as I say numerous other establishments where you will receive a warm welcome and better service 
negative, We ate here as a family group of 11 and we BOOKED for Sunday roast Firstly I can t really comment on the service as we hardly had any we constantly had to keep going to the bar to ask for the next course sauces and cutlery The food was disgusting cold gravy no roast potatoes roast parsnips cooked so hard they were tasteless and unedable vegtables either uncooked over cooked or cold Excuses included none left but we booked  all gone but we cooked  we mixed the roasties in with the other veg why And I only started here today  the cook  Total joke except the price basically I would certainly never go again and I can see why other reviewers arn t happy 
negative, This is quite possibly the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant The food was not at all Indian and the wait staff rude 
negative, really not for the faint hearted The food is dreadful and the kitchen looks suspect There must be more e factors in their sauces plus sugar and salt that are really really bad for you Shame the village needs a good chinese 
negative, I had been a longtime customer at this takeaway but since the owner has taken charge recently the quality and service has taken a dive  I used to rave about this place for its quality and service and visit twice a week but since the owner has returned and brought a new cook  not chef and let the experienced staff go it has fallen flat  I have tried it twice in two months and it is disgusting The customer service has fallen the quality has gone and it tastes like a water based curry made with cheep curry powder not fresh spices and ingredients  The prices have gone up and everything else has gone down Sadly another case of a greedy owner trying to sell poor quality products at premium prices  I shall never return again and strongly advise you not to go either as you will be disappointed 
negative, Started well got seated then ordered 2 course Sunday Lunch 1st course took an hour to arrive Patte come with bread should be toast but hey ho Next course arrived in 30 mins yorkshire pudding still frozen at the bottom Food luke warm Plate freezing cold Tried to get the attention of staff but no one to be seen afte 15 mins gave up Nibbled at the veg Then waited and waited and waited and waited to pay so we walked to the desk range the bell after 5 min a human being Amazing then to be told we do not take card payments It 2016 not 1900 s So paid cash can we have a receipt Well what a palaver we do not have a receipts and he dissapeared 5 mins later a bit of paper with a vat number on Not very 20th Century Unbelievable Safe to say we wont be back again 
negative, the price of drink in this bar is OTT mixers are flat and very over price like the drink staff not very nice or helpfully food over price and not good very limited also not clean wc or bar i have email my office not to us this bar 
negative, My first and last visit From start to finish the service was awful We arrived promptly for 3pm on Mothers Day and were left waiting for ages to be shown to our pre- booked table We ordered our mail meal at 3 10 which arrived just before 4pm I had the roast beef dinner I needed a magnifying glass to find the roast potatoes In fairness the unfriendly waitress did get me some more The roast beef was just awful and cold A number of drinks were put on our meal which we didn t have and to top it all we were asked to pay 30 service charge We were then invited to leave at 5 15pm as the table was booked for another family Try this establishment if you wish but nothing would entice me to go back there again 
negative, Me and my girlfriend came to Stratford Upon Avon for the afternoon Having been here to the Pen and Parchment before we thought why not This score is no way a reflection on the waitresses who served us They were friendly It was everything else that helped in scoring this establishment so low It took about 30 minutes to receive our meals Whilst my girlfriend was ok with her meal and her words tastes a bit better than Wetherspoons  I received a fish an chips that looked like it was a reject from a previous customer a couple of days ago The batter was more of a dark brown with a slight greyish tint to it and the fish looked quite shrivelled Whilst ordering our food we also ordered a dessert each We was told that they would bring them out as soon as we ve finished our meals 20 minutes after finishing our meals and numerous waitresses walking past I went and enquired about the desserts To my delight I had Mr Grumpy telling me that it s been a busy afternoon lots of people have been in and it will be a 6 minute wait  A further 20 minutes had passed from that point This time my girlfriend enquired about the desserts to which we were told that it should be out shortly Having waited a further 5 minutes a waitress came out and asked what desserts we ordered as they had lost our ticket At this point which I can t believe we waited so long for what probably would have been below mediocre fudge cake we decided to leave it and get the money back for the desserts I understand at busy times it may be a bit longer to get food but a business should always be ready On a side note we decided to sit outside due to the indoors being quite crowded Half of the tables had parasols and the other half were left to face the sun We ended up with a table that didn t help the shrivelled fish Either every table has a parasol or no table does Make up your mind The slow service and the mis-management of staff who were running around without a clue and the poor quality of food or lack of food in one case especially for the price we paid is in my opinion the scoring of one star is totally justified  Take our advice and avoid 
negative, The sign says when entering please wait to be seated so we waited and waited despite three members of staff chatting away in the kitchen doing nothing  Most tables were taken so it was as if they did not want us there So we left and went across the road to Trinity House Coffee Shop who were excellent This was our first visit to Axminster and will not bother with River Cottage if we ever pass through again 
negative, 12 5  discretional service fees will be charged cannot be deleted The manager said Don t come if you don t want to pay the service fees  
negative, A very disappointing Sunday lunch with ten members of our family to celebrate a birthday The so called roast was abysmal and to use deep fried potatoes and call them roasties was a laugh There was a 40 minute gap between starters and main courses It will be a long time or even never before our families visit the Crewe Arms at Hinton in Hedges again PS don t take the children because there was no children s menu 
negative, I came here for breakfast with uni friends but we were left disappointed  Very cramped and food tasted cheap  I ordered breakfast which came with chips which tasted as though it was refried  Sausages were nice though  My tea was so weak and far too milky but I guess I m a picky when it comes to tea 
negative, Me and my girlfriend have been here twice Our first time was really nice with delicious food and we advised people to check it out My last visit sadly left me visiting the hospital with a severe case of food poisoning The food did not taste quite as good as the first time and the waitresses were just wandering around like head-less chickens After having our starters taken away we was asked if we would like desserts I don t know what they are doing wrong but suggest staying away until it is sorted 
negative, For years this has been our local pub What on earth has happened to it Tonight we visited as usual only to find blaring jarring music from several karaoke singers who couldn t sing We could not hold a conversation and left We had to hoped to have a meal Who is the management catering for here The toilets were disgusting In the women s according to our friend one toilet was full to the brim another had a missing toilet seat and the other had no toilet paper In the gents the tap unit is almost off the wall Greene King need to wake-up because this used to be a very nice pub until recently 
negative, I have visited this coffee house on two occasions now and although the food has been decent albeit over priced  the service has been utterly dreadful Both times the waitresses have looked disinterested and been rude to us when we acquired about our food Which incidentally is nothing special and not worth the wait   Needless to say I shall not be visiting again 
negative, Plus points no real wait for a table Staff pleasant Service quick Minus points cold doughy pancakes Waited 15 minutes with nothing on any plates or in any glasses to pay our bill Then had to run to our gate 
negative,Waiting nearly five minutes for a couple of cups of coffee is not what you expect from Costa and with dirty tables just about capped a very dissappointing visit We will never go back 
negative, I went inside to look at the takeaway menu as there is nothing outside and decided not to buy I had not engaged with staff so when I heard  Hope you have a nice day as I walked out the door with my back to all service staff said with clear sarcastic undertones I was absolutely gobsmacked  This place is now on my blacklist  
negative, I had a spaghetti boll-anise which tasked more of salt than anything else it seemed more salty than the sea My wife had a sea-food meal which was only slightly saltier than she expected  Conversation was not possible as the interior is all highly reflective surfaces with lots of metal which leads to a very high noise level - it increased a lot whilst we were eating  I did not complain at the time as I just needed to get out of the place before my hearing went completely  And I admit to having some tinnitus at all times  To be fair to the restaurant some of my friends have eaten there and found it acceptable not something special 
negative, Went here on 6 5 to celebrate my 50th birthday with four work colleagues Despite booking and a sign warning 30 minutes wait for lunch or food arrived 75 minutes an hour an a 1 4 after we placed the order  And were had to chase it up to get it at that time The food was okay but my colleagues burger was dried up and crusty and our drinks were all warm and tepid after over an hour s wait for our food It was supposed to be a short lunch trip but we arrived at 12 44 and left at 14 47  In fact we were so late leaving I had to call my wife up and get her out of her bed she was sick to collect our children from school at 15 00 hrs as I was so late We vowed we will never return We have visited numerous local pubs for lunch over three past year and always managed an hour out of the office  This was 3 hours   To top it all off nicely I arrive home today after a business trip to find a parking fine from PPS for 100 for parking my car in the pub car park   Apparently there are several signs for pay and display but none of us saw them but to be fair you don t except to pay to park in a pub car park when you are dining there I called the pub to check this wasn t a scam It isn t They confirmed my booking and visit but said they couldn t help with the fine  So an average lunch with a horrendous wait and a bill of over 150    Happy 50th birthday  
negative, Had lunch today at Stags Leap today both meals were absolutely revolting The meals had to be returned to be warmed up as they were cold in the middle especially the gammon which wasn t even cooked the second time around as it was very pale and watery The pie wasn t much better the pasty was very doughy and it was cold We requested 2 eggs with the gammon instead of the egg and pineapple it arrived without the pineapple and only one egg The chips just tasted of burnt fat We certainly wont be returning or recommending the Stags Leap to anyone 
negative, I booked a night with my family when we arrived we was told that we never booked we asked to speak to the person in charge and a lady named Jackie came over and told us we would have to come back another time as they never had a record of us booking it was my dads 71st birthday we had to eat at the red loin down the road I was very upset by the way we was spoke to and delt with 
negative, What a shame  Skipped dessert and rushed here as it was closing at 11 Got there at 10 30 but was told we couldnt sit in as it closed at 11 I dont understand why we couldnt eat in even when we assured her we would finish by 11 Wednesday night  
negative, I m not normally one to make a fuss but my brunch experience this morning takes the probably inedible biscuit  I visited the Exeter St bakery in Finsbury park for the third and likely final time  Don t get me wrong they have good coffee and have brilliant bread now being stocked in local waitrose stores - but running a successful brunch venue is about more than bread and coffee  I m writing this safe in the knowledge that my struggle was the epitome of a first world problem but I think it s a funny story - so here we go  We were greeted warmly when we walked in to join our friends who were already a flat white ahead of us  Since they d already chosen their food we quickly reviewed the menu so that we could order our food together I drink lots of water so I ask the waiter if a can have a large jug to accompany our coffees  When the coffees arrive and the water doesn t I decide to give it a couple of minutes as they re often brought separately When the water doesn t come back I remind him and he promptly brings me a small glass to sate my admittedly unreasonable appetite for water  Meh It s just water I ll get over it No biggie  We get chatting about our food choices It s on the expensive end of reasonable but the Italian-inspired menu modern interior design and exposed kitchen give you the confidence that it s going to be worth it  It isn t  I notice two things when my Eggs Benedict with extra mushrooms arrives The first is that I ve actually ordered Egg Benedict with a solitary sad-looking under-poached thing staring up at me My second observation is that the watery curdled brown liquid covering my plate is supposed to be Hollandaise sauce  I mention this to the nearest waitress who struggles to understand the problem After a couple of attempts to explain she disappears leaving the plate to go and speak to someone else A man appears who again asks what the problem is  Sorry to be a pain I say  But the sauce seems to have split  I m met with a deeply confused response by the handsome looking italian waiter Perhaps he didn t hear me correctly   I don t think the sauce should be like this I say  it s curdled  His facial expression evolves from confusion to misunderstanding followed swiftly by mild panic and finally settling on light fear  He runs away to get someone else  My friend gets her phone out to google Hollandaise sauce - realising that a picture of what it looks like may help to resolve the problem  Luckily it didn t come to that a slightly older woman approaches the table with her two underlings in tow and quickly identifies the issue  Your sauce isn t right she spots  let me get you another one  Great Problem solved Except it isn t  She returns 60 seconds later to tell me that it will be another 20 mins before the chef can make another batch of sauce Would I like something else I decide against it as my friends are already most of the way through their meals  Their choices whilst a bit smaller than you d hope for looked reasonably tasty Up until this point however I d clearly been too wrapped up in my sauce debacle to understand the reality  One friend ordered avocado and vine tomatoes on toast but had also fallen foul pun intended of the singular plural oval issue with his side order of one Eggs  Another had an under-poached and broken egg s  My third friend had ordered the delicious-looking vegetarian full Italian breakfast but looks as we all know can be deceiving  You ve heard the phase Mutton dressed as lamb  well she had salt dressed as spinach  I tried a small forkful and it caused the right hand side of my face to figuratively turn inside itself  Anyway they finished the edible bits of their meals and we ask for the bill  Whilst the first bill was wrong a second corrected one was quickly produced  My friends try to pay at the table however the wireless card machine stops working so we have to all get up and pay at the main till  My first friend tells the till server twice the portion of the bill she d like to pay she is confused when she is presented the card machine displaying the full bill amount Another mistake that s quickly corrected again  Then something happens that I ve never seen before  The surprise icing on the cake  You know how it feels You re waiting diligently at the till ready to type in your PIN whilst a staff member dutifully enters the amount due into the chip and pin machine Imagine my friend s surprise then when rather being passed the machine the server proceeds in a staggering display of stupidity to TYPE IN HIS OWN PIN  We walk out in stunned silence trying to decide whether or not we ve just been the subjects of a bizarre new hidden camera show  Whilst I ve quite enjoyed looking back on our experience and writing this I do feel quite strongly that Exeter St Bakery is a shining beacon of what is wrong with coffee shop culture  A menu that is misleading to customers a shop that s successful only by virtue of a great location and a management who have clearly invested so much money on their website and on modern furniture that there is nothing left over for any semblance of cooking or customer service training  I d urge Finsbury Park locals to vote with their feet and avoid this disaster 
negative,This morning 4 of us went for breakfast at The Turf toby carvery  It was the worst breakfast any of us had ever had  The scrambled egg was just a mouthful of powder the sausage wasn t at all good and the beans were empty so we asked for the new jug that was behind and there was a crust on the top of them where they had been kept warm obviously for some time  The lady that was serving really didn t want to be there should have got her name  The only thing most of us ate was the toast and bacon What a waste of money  Don t usually bother with reviews but this was that bad I felt that I had to 
negative, I was provided with a specials menu and placed an order 10 minutes later I was advised that i had been provided with the wrong menu and that what I had ordered was not available  I eventually order a medium steak Chips and NO peas However I was served a well-done steak chips AND PEAS  I provided feedback via the chain website as requested and opted for someone o contact me about the poor service I m still waiting on the call now  
negative, Visited Taj Lounge on our last day in Nottingham and what a let down We were greeted and seated and left with the menus definitely had a wide choice with some new dishes but the waiting staff did have very good knowledge of the menu as they were unable to recommend anything The chicken was tough and the lamb was gristly and the thing i hate most is when the toilets are not clean overall this was a huge disappointment as it looks nice from the outside 
negative,We went here on the 04 07 2015 Firstly greeted by that there is a 45 min wait for a table not prompting anything else available  We mentioned about the outside meeting area to be informed that was available immediately 2 parties sitting at the same table ordered at the same time to then only one half of the order to turn up because they were confused on the similar orders As it was the initial order came out a hour and a half later from when ordered No apology or notice was given about the delay the toilets were absolutely disgusting and the staff are most certainly inexperienced to not even knowingness table numbers Will not be going again
negative, So having just been let down massively by the Sawley Arms we continued our hunt for a more imaginative vegetarian option for the better half  Maybe we should have realised when the vegetarian menu was separate to the main but we took our seats and asked  Again the menu for the meat eaters like me looked good but the vegetarian was lacking Why oh why do people think all veggies eat is mushrooms The mushroom stroganoff didn t inspire neither did the other options of pasta or veg curry Surely there are enough local farms nearby to get fresh veg and how hard can it be to bake a nice veg tart or similar Anyway excuses were made and away we went back home to make our own tea 
negative, Sammie and Ben have turned the place around however they were not there today and it was a shambles Waited 15 minutes for our orders to be taken and after a further 25 minutes food and drink had not arrived Others coming in after us got their drinks before us Very poor excuses and duty management  I suggest phone ahead to see if Sammie and Ben are in 
negative, The fish and chips have gotten smaller definitely not worth the money Also ordered a faggot wanted to see how theirs were  well they were absolutely disgusting if I hadn t already taken them home I would have taken them back I definitely wont be back Will stick to Francines in future 
negative, ventured here to receive awful service had to wait a while to order only to go outside and see all the staff stood round the back smoking The place itself is very unclean sat down for 5 mins untill we noticed ants on the tables and floors moved to other side of the restaurant only to find more ants crawling around left over bits of food on the floor complained but could see it went in one ear and out the other in the end we ate in our cars avoid at all costs 
negative, Visited Sunday evening at 1945 before bank holiday Monday Place appeared busy but not packed Waited to be seen by member of staff was then informed that waiting time for food would be around a hour even though there were empty tables It seems that Ask have a serious problem with staffing levels and being a bank holiday would have allowed for this 
negative,We used to love it here and come regularly But we hadnt been for a while as our last visit disappointed us with quality of food and price so expensive  We had friends in town so decided to return as we d seen it had been refurbished so was interested to see what had changed  The places looks gaudy and my wife compared it to something you d see on Desperate Scousewives or TOWIE Sparkly shiny but no class Where has the Thai-ness gone The food was presented well but quality ingredients were not there - no thai eggplant but frozen peas  The food was tasteless and just lacking in so many departments Bad quality meat frozen and smaller portions than they used to  The service is one of the main reasons we used to love it here But it has gone Rushing to get you in and out of the restaurant Our food appeared so quickly and we were almost sat on the same table as the people besides us We skipped dessert as we felt we were being forced out  Im so sorry Chaophraya as we loved you but not anymore There s too many better Thai options out there now 
negative, Nipped in today around 11 30 The pub was empty so didn t want to risk the overnight pint I was charged 2 20 for a half When I asked the cost of a pint I was told 3 90 So - a premium of 25p for a half Disgraceful 
negative, This place must have a reputation for poor service  As we were looking at the menu outside a local lady came over and mentioned to us not to bother Slightly bemused by this we continued upstairs thinking we would give it a go Mostly because this was the only place with empty seats in busy Padstow  We now know why  We were greeted by a very hostile unfriendly waitress who questioned us relentlessly on what we were planning to order bizarre as we hadn t even sat down to look at a menu properly  Maybe she wanted to work out how much we were planning on spending We said that we wanted some lunch and maybe some hot drinks as it was a particularly rainy day to which she made a very obvious eye-roll She then told us Well you can sit at the bar but it s not very nice  The ENTIRE place was empty Maybe they had a large booking in we don t know as no reason was given as to why this was our only option but the tables were not laid out as such and even so there was plenty of room It wasn t even peak time We reluctantly agreed knowing this was really the only option as everywhere else was so busy We even politely suggested that we would be happy to just have drinks if they were due to be busy  Then to our amazement as we stepped forward to take our seats she stood in front of us blocking the way and said If you want hot drinks then go somewhere else We looked at each other in total disbelief and decided to leave  We have never experienced anything like it It s like they don t want customers   The staff need some serious training in customer service Rude beyond belief  Ps Dear management we would be great full for a response apology as to why we were treated so appallingly rather than requesting our review gets deleted  We have seen many other similar reviews disappear  which is therefore giving a false representation 
negative,What a disgusting event dining at Ruby Blue  We arrived the manager said hello then turned his back on us looking flustered and got a waiter to seat us  After 15 minutes the manager came over to take out order only after being asked to He asked what we would like then turned his back on us again and thrust a new meme bet of staff at us She was delightful yet obviously untrained  Our food was slow and burnt and tasteless  Our drinks took an age to arrive  The flustered manager was running around the restaurant so much so he nearly knocked drinks from our table twice  When talking to him at the end his explanation was well it s busy what do you expect The venue was at half capacity at any time  What a disgusting experience poor management and overall a never to return venue 
negative, Our family visited the Hare & Hounds in June for Sunday Lunch - The board outside was advertising the lunch at a set price when we sat down we were told rather bluntly that the lamb cutlets was 1 50 extra  The tables were sticky and there were no tablecloths we had to ask for the basics - salt & pepper  The waitress landlady really didnt want to be there - she was miserable and unresponsive when we tried to engage in light conversation an hello would have been nice The food was adequate with a very limited menu When we were presented with the desert menu we we told what NOT was available from it as opposed to what was on it My husband ordered a Crumble - it would have served all four of us it was so big it was stodgey and there was far too much When the Landlord appeared with the bill he was a bit more sociable he asked if we would mind placing a review on tripadvisor - apparantly they dont get many reviews - I wander why   WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING 
negative, I m afraid I was unable to review the restaurant s menu but that was because my wife and I were turned away from the eaterie when it first opened Having booked the previous day ensuring the staff repeated our booking time and having provided our telephone number we were shown the door without an apology or staff showing a care in the world and not the least bit interested by the fact we had booked We weren t the only prospective diners either Two other couples who had also booked found they didn t have a table too I live in Great Baddow and happily welcome any new eaterie but with this sort of customer care I won t be setting foot in the establishment again I suggest you head for the Yasmin in Baddow Road where you re always welcomed with a smile and always seated regardless of how busy they are 
negative,4 of us dined at Gilgamesh - the food was very good and the restaurant had a real buzz about it However there was a major service issue The bill was over 800 00 When asked if we wanted white or pink champagne at the start of the night a colleague of mine chose the pink It was not pointed out to us that the pink champagne was in fact 250 more than the white champagne until it came to ordering the second bottle we then chose the white The price difference should have been highlighted as both champagnes were the same brand and the same year Despite trying to resolve the issue and despite following up to management on several occasions - we refused to tip and will not take our clients or friends to this restaurant again It s a shame because it s in a good location if you are in North London and would have been somewhere I would have booked again on numerous occasions 
negative,Staff are top the manager is really polite and good at his job but the Chef needs sacking I have been to this chain in York and they are worlds apart you wouldn t think it was the same pub I got a xxl burger first it was burnt so i complained then the second one was so wet and soggy it fell apart third time i got my money back This was the place to be for food as little as a year ago how its got so bad i dont know 
negative, Probably one of the worst places I ve ever had the misfortune of visiting The facilities were disgraceful the food was cold and over 30 minutes late and one waitress in particular was exceptionally rude to me and constantly abusing me even refusing to serve me alcohol for no reason whatsoever even with valid ID  Avoid this place at all costs especially the waitress 
negative, I have to admit I am somewhat partial to a traditional steak and ale pie and It s usually my first choice from a menu rather than anything else Looking at The Lock Keeper menu the description given to their shortcrust pie tempted me to give it a taste I wish I hadn t bothered  Described as being deep filled Oh dear no I had to search for any of the so called tender beef chunks of meat and found none Shortcrust It was in fact nothing more than an overpoweringly soggy and squelchy mess The vegetables fared no better If I had closed my eyes I wouldn t have known what I was eating other than to say the items on my fork were lukewarm and tasteless It really was that bad  Not wishing to embarrass or annoy anyone in our party I said very little about the meal On this occasion however as things were so bad I would have made an appropriate comment if given the opportunity to do so Sadly no member of The Lock Keeper staff showed any interest in myself or my colleagues which was yet another disappointment Would I go there again No   
negative, I never like to write bad reviews but this had to be said I came here for Christmas lunch along with other family members as it got us out of the routine of doing the same old traditional thing each year and thought that it might be different  Well   it was different but not in a good way  Even though most of the reviews seem quite generous based on TURKISH food that they do serve I had a differing view on food that is relatively simple  We arrived here around 12 30pm on Christmas Day - the place was half full - if that The first thing I noticed was that there were only 2 waiting staff plus a barman looking after the whole restaurant - a young gentleman and a lady who both judging by their mannerisms looked very inexperienced and not even sure of themselves You could tell immediately that this was a recipe for disaster and that something was going to go wrong  We were given menus by the waitress who prompted us to order food straight away without even asking us for drinks When someone told her we wanted drinks first she obliged and went to order them We then found ourselves talking amongst each other whilst the restaurant filled up more and more after about a 20 minute wait we received our drinks - on the menu it said it was draught beer however i could blatantly see the barman opening cans from behind the bar and filling up a pint glass It was also completely flat and tasteless obviously a knock off out of date can from the corner shop next door  Another half an hour went by and they got round to ordering our food and it was at this time that the table next to us was just seated - around the same amount of people as us We were just sat there waiting for prawn cocktails for another half an hour - understandably the restaurant floor would be slow but not the kitchen too  Lo and behold they arrived - only to be put down on the table next to us who where being seated when we had just ordered They apologized to us but it wasn t their fault They where also not happy as they had their own situation as well they had been complaining about making a reservation to the guy who didn t have a clue what they meant he just started moving tables around to accommodate them  Surely they must have the tables ready before  Someone from my family who works in a restaurant did go and see what was going on and peeked her head around into the kitchen She said it looked like chaos with plates and food everywhere all over the floor the staff just seemed to have been not prepared for this sort of thing and very short staffed I put this down to bad management as we could not see a manager in sight i mean i know its Christmas day and all but if you can t cope then why open Especially if there is only 2 of them We then decided enough was enough and just got up and left with no apology from any of the staff We managed to see the humorous side of it soon after - but on their part it was ridiculous and pitiful  Well it was a memorable Christmas but unfortunately one that won t be remembered for the right reasons  
negative, We arrived as a party of 6 We re told sit were you like Food was very good But the service was diabolical and will never eat here again 
negative, A visit back in time a well appointed clean American Diner At the time of visit the diner was nearly full all tables were in use and the staff which consisted of 2 waitresses and a chef we re at full stretch The menu was varied and most dishes were available The downside for me was as a party of 6 3 of the dishes came without an item of food as per the menu and another item was of poor quality on 2 of the dishes Due to the number of diners and only 2 waitresses the service was below the standard I would have expected On this showing I could not recommend this diner however I intend to check it out again in the future and hope things will have changed for the better 
negative,I have not had tough lamb covered in an indistinguishable sauce for years The lamb was tough and cold I think they just poured a hot sauce over it It was a sunday night however and maybe the chef was off
negative, I ask is it me because this is the second review I ve done where I have walked out of a restaurant without actually eating the food Whilst I don t think I was out of order doing so it still makes me wonder if I m being overly harsh I ll let you be the judge  So preamble I am a Big Easy fan The Kings Road branch was a favourite so when I heard they were opening one in Covent Garden I was pretty chufffed I despise generic marketing spiel but I signed up for the soft launch and generic marketing from the firm as I was a fan of the brand  So my girlfriend and I went along after reading that the Big Easy had an extensive area for walk in diners As it was a Saturday we went with the knowledge that it was down to the luck of the draw and upon arrival we were told there were no tables and we could wait to get a space in the walk in area which I will call the counter The concierge told us this be saying You can try and get onto the counter  My internal monologue was  Try    Try Hmmmmm what does that mean I should probably ask   whoa look at all of the booze they have    I know I got distracted by the collection of spirits and I let it slide  School boy error  We were told that access to the counter was first come first served And after seeing a few people nearing the ends of their meals we though we would get on pretty swiftly This is where things went awry  It s not actually first come first serve but is more if you see a space you fight to get it  Seriously  So whilst we were at the bar knocking back some cocktails  the single star in basically because the barman was decent 4 people got into the walk-in area before us  This is idiotic  I m more than happy to say that we could have been more vigilant but essentially I don t really expect to have to battle to get one of the maybe 10-14 seats they have available If we are first in take our names and get us onto the counter area when someone leaves We shouldn t really have to be competing with others to get fed Perhaps I m not down with the kids and this is the way things work now heck I admit I struggled with Meat Liquors no reservation policy but this is a bit much  Also as we entered one waitress actually took a couple over to the counter to sit down Is it every man for themselves or are waitresses meant to take people over to the area  Anyway being the more ahem militant of my party I was ready to leave after the second couple got on ahead of us this was around the 30 minute mark However it took one of the waitresses shoving my girlfriend for us to decide to leave  Obviously as soon as we made it known that we were leaving everyone was extremely helpful with a table only moments away but by that point I d had enough If they can t even get something as basic as queuing correct how can you trust them with your food  There was a happy ending - we ended up going to Hawksmoor Great service great staff and no waiting around like lemons 
negative, took my granddaughter for lunch so disappointed place was so cold sat we with coats on people still working on the place 8 pound for a burger 3 for fries 11 pound all told and don t serve tea or coffee you are having a laugh 
negative, I see Dive advertised everywhere all over social media and blogger sites So i thought i would finally give it a go It was only a quick trip on a Thursday evening but it was long enough to see how poor this place is We knew it was cheap but come on  We arrived and it was very quiet just around 4 people in there it is a confusing place no clear indication for the dining area and no attentive staff to greet you it s all about first impressions We were seated by a lady she looked like a manager by what she was wearing she sat us down 10 minutes later she had not been over to us for drinks considering she was about 6 ft away from us at the pass she was too busy chatting to the chef never even glanced at us I had to go over and do the old do we order at the table or the bar routine just for a bit of service  She sat me back down and we ordered i ordered chicken wings with the suicidal sauce which lived up to the name inedible it was so hot bit extreme compared to most other places hot sauces the wings were so poor quality they made me feel sick to eat but we were in a rush and man gotta eat so dry and grey i have honestly had better at a Wetherspoons They must have been microwaved or going out of date  We were so disappointed by the whole place attitude of the staff was i don t wanna be here and slow and the food was just abysmal They also say this place is a sports bar from looking around i wouldn t recommend small screens and awkwardly laid out  Maybe they should put more effort and money into the quality of training service and food quality than the marketing side of things  One of the poorest bars in Manchester Aptly named Dive 
negative, to many crying children food cheep for people who are on a very tight budget would not go back steak was over cooked and chewy and not big portions for what you pay thank god you got a mint with the bill 
negative,Went on Saturday evening 7 Dec 2013 Having had lunch here a couple of weeks ago we thought we would try it out for an evening meal Bad move The new landlord is arrogant rude and aggressive I have complained to the brewery It took 20 mins for our order to be taken restaurant  was empty Food was ok chips the best bit Girlfriends steak had lot of fat through it Peas not cooked I provided polite feedback to the waitress who passed on to the landlord We overheard the conversation in the kitchen to the effect if   if they want to complain tell then not to comeback Sole to landlord who was rude and aggressive even accused us of booking and knowing he had 7 other diners in   threatened with court action if I refused to pay the bill and would take car registration We will not be going back and I am looking forward to discuss the matter with Everards 
negative, Visited here before seeing Michael Palin at Queen Elizabeth Hall Found the whole experience very disappointing  Service was poor I had to repeatedly ask for the set menu I had seen they offered whilst browsing their website earlier in the day as the staff either did not know this existed or more likely my opinion didn t want me to have it as they can make more money €˜ la carte  As for the food itself the fried chicken starter tasted burnt and the main courses were average at best I have the distinct feeling chips I was served had been sitting around for quite a while before they ever got to me The restaurant also looks very shabby and tired in desperate need of money spending on it It is a shame they don t seem very interested in their customers I guess they rely on just tourist trade  I ate in canteen on Baker Street several years ago found it to be a fantastic experience I cannot believe just how much the chain has gone downhill  it is certainly not restaurant I will visit again 
negative, You can call it anything but I am sorry this is not authentic Italian food In fact this has nothing to do with Italian food Our salmon was not well cooked let alone fresh The spaghetti were so badly cooked they became offensive to anyone who remotely understands Italian food I would like this restaurant s manager to tell me what they mean exactly by authentic Italian  Perhaps they are referring to their soggy over cooked chopped off spaghetti or perhaps the frozen fish soaked in a sickly looking whitish sauce It is not surprising that they can t even manage to grill a perfectly British steak after all that should not be too foreign for them Please do not call this Italian    
negative,the food was ok but the service was awful 20 minutes before the starters arrived an hour before the mains the excuse a large takeaway order one waitress and one chef walked out without paying for the drinks   and the waitress finally moved to demand payment and we negotiated 15 of the food bill because the whole experience was so crap rubbish rubbish rubbish won t go there again 
negative, Painfully slow on two separate visits  Completely ruins the experience as you sit waiting for food and then sit waiting for the bill  One hour before food came out   
negative,we have had a busy weekend and didnt have any food in so we decided to go to the very good thai in eastwood but because it was closed we ended up at the farmhouse i wish we had just gone home my sons are 13 and 15 and although we often eat out its years since they have been to an indian im really sad that they are saying that they never want to eat indian food again they had a chicken korma and a chicken tikka masala and i have to say that after trying it i dont know how they stomached it there were no other diners in and not once did the waiter ask if our food was alright otherwise i would have told him that 2 of the dishes were inedible instead we just paid the bill and wont be going back 
negative, I popped to this drive through in my lunch hour I arrived at 13 15 to find a queue normal which I joined Once you join the queue at a drive through you re pretty committed as you can t get out usually After 30 mins of waiting I ended up second in the queue at the order booth 10 mins later the bloke in front still hadn t had his order taken I walked to the window and explained that a number of us had now been stuck in the queue for over 40 mins I asked if any freebies would be given as a good will gesture and the reply was  We only have two staff on and there s nothing I can do   I got back into my car and managed to cut over a high kerb over the pavement and out of there and straight down the road to the nearest McDonald s where I received very quick and efficient service as usual from staff who are properly trained to deal with customers 
negative, We have visited the Talbot a number of times and really like the location Most times it s good and lots of our friends eat there but have recently said it was going down hill a bit Unpreterb we thought we would call in and eat MISTAKE food took ages to come my chicken was dry and cold almost like it had been microwaved shame as it used to be so good 
negative, This establishment resembles what i would imagine to be a shelter for the down and outs low quality food at knock down prices served by low pay staff who show little interest in the customer  If you enjoy your pint surrounded by plates of partly uneaten food topped by poor service this is the place for you 
negative, I took my parents to Aldeburgh as it was my dad s birthday we got fish and chips from next door and were looking forward to eating with a pint from the White Hart pub we were sitting on a bench when the heavens opened and the rain was very heavy We couldn t find shelter so thought we could stand inside the pub until the rain eased However we were turfed out of the pub very abruptly and back into the rain I could understand that we were not allowed to eat inside the pub but even when I asked to not eat the food I was told to get out  It wasn t a particularly nice way to be spoken to perhaps the member of staff was having a bad day  
negative,i work in the restaurant trade and supply equipment into restaurants but the meal i had at the mogal was stocking  I had heard bad things about this place before but as its shown on the Sharwoods TV advert i though things must of changed  The were mole on my food on a pepper and when i pointed this out the waiter told me it was how peppers go in a curry i think not he took it away but i told him that my partner and i were going as that was discusting but he told me i had to pay as i went to walk out he said if i didnt pay he would call the police  I m still waiting for a police officer to get me for this massive crime  HONESTLY NEVER GO NEAR THIS RESTAURANT
negative, Smoked Mac and cheese was ordered  Penne pasta with a garlic and cheese sauce was what I received Service is also poor Less focus on being trendy is required 
negative, I think you could train a monkey with 1 arm to cook breakfast better than the chef who made ours service was sub standard and staff looked really unhappy I would as well though if they had to keep bringing food out that looked and tasted like the rubbish we were given  going to wetherspoons next time 
negative,They send you the wrong meals if you order a take away It arrives spilled the order is wrong and has hair in it And then they tell you not to come back to them when you complain and ask for a change Never ever going back
negative, This was booked as a cheap but cheerful night out but what a disappointment The food was slightly less than average for the price but the service was uneven Drinks arrived fairly quickly but the wine bottle was left on table minus cork and untested Main course arrived fairly quickly but was slightly wrong A medium steak was well done but edible Then            nothing Mrs D  same blood line as Mother Theresa wearing her outdoor coat due to the cold trotted off to find the dessert menus Only three tables occupied in restaurant but you could have died of malnutrition waiting I only wanted cheese and biscuits but no they were off How difficult is it to keep cheese and biscuits for Gods sake It is a personal annoyance of mine to be given a menu where you only find out when you order that they don t have the goods advertised We left went to Sainsburys just down the High street and purchased desserts and cheese and crackers It was wonderful  My God this place is hopeless 
negative, After having toured the wonderful Lion Witch and the Wardrobe Christmas decorations our party of 7 NT members stopped by here late morning Despite being first in line after a wait of almost 10 minutes we were told in quite a brusque manner that we were too big a group to be accommodated - despite the restaurant being empty on one side and with more than enough seats on the other No effort was made by the senior staff member who spoke with us and it left us with a bad impression Clearly there is a need for staff training - or at least a transfer of the enthusiasm shown by the volunteers in the house let alone the lost revenue 
negative, Tried to make a group booking for my daughters christening Spoke to the manager who was unhelpful and rude and suggested she may be busy then due to Christmas Unhelpful terse and wholly disinterested Went elsewhere where they were accommodating and polite 
negative, I had high espectations about this restaurant but i was left very disappointed Food was nothing exceptional and not worth the money Service unfriendly and far from professional Avoid 
negative, Had a Bakewell pud about 12 years ago and it was fabulous so when travelling back from Bridlington we decided to take a long detour and renew the memory Wish I had saved the petrol  When we arrived home [Cornwall] we made coffee and cut the pudding only to find that the filling was all but non existent All the more annoying as the one on the counter cut into small try me pieces was just as it should be A total waste of time and money 
negative,Ive been visiting the fleece for a long time as i live in the area With that in mind i have seen the steady fall in service to the point of just feeling like my presence being a strain on staff to move or help in any sence of the way Its a shame really as the food quality is good but just not worth the hassle anymore   james
negative, Absolutely terrible this used to be the place to go to now this is now the place to avoid overpriced rubbish So they used to be known for their ribs you get better for under a 5 in Aldi Waitrose taking place before we finished Then somebody with the vacuum cleaner hoovering around our feet while we were still eating Avoid the soft drinks as they come at a premium rate 
negative, Family of 4 Left waiting to be served in a virtually empty room whilst other people got served well they missed out on at least 20 We were asked to be seated and would be served another group came in obviously friends of the staff and got server straight away  Will not be going back in a hurry try the pub a little further down as they dont ignore customers 
negative, As I had eaten at Prezzos several times and always been satisfied I felt confident to try this new branch in Dereham What a mistake The service was atrocious from the moment we arrived We were completely ignored by staff as we awaited a table This set the scene for what was to follow When the food eventually arrived the waitress passed dishes across the table in front of me to those seated opposite without any excuse me  She was clearly too lazy to walk round the table to serve in the correct manner As we were a small group we wanted to split the bill but was told this was not possible The final straw came with the serving of sorbets in a small glass dish We were provided with desert spoons which were almost too large to enter the bowl Turning to the food this was served lukewarm so lacked the usual appeal Value for money  given the above was poor One word of caution the bill arrived with a service charge automatically included A new bill had to be obtained when we refused to pay for Service  The test for any restaurant is whether one would return but in this case never again 
negative, Extremely slow and rude bar staff made this far less enjoyable than it should have been I would recommend avoiding there are better places near by 
negative, Visited Pizza Hut Halifax recently with a friend Place was not very busy was shown to a table and told order would be taken shortly 20 mins later after 2 requests to give an order we finally ordered 2 pizzas and 2 portions of chips and a bottle of wine 5 mins later came back with news they didn t have the wine we ordered and to choose an alternative shortly afterwards 2 pizzas arrived in there pans no plates were offered no portions of chips either after apologising 2 plates arrived 5 mins later chips arrived but only 1 portion Food was actually okay we finished our meal and drink and asked for our bill this arrived to our table and on inspection found 2 extra drinks we didn t have were included when queried this was corrected  Overall conclusion Food reasonably good service absolutely horrendous 
negative, 2nd visit and we were totally shocked We had only just sat down when a woman that turned out to be the landlady argued with an elderly lady who complained about a dirty glass she then banned her Then a chap was accused of making a complaint to environmental health about being served cheap vodka and was asked to leave also although she actually stood and blatantly said it was her partner that served the cheap vodka and sometimes served none as he did not like the customer We had already ordered so sat tight but then did notice that our glasses were very dirty  we dare not complain  The food came and was much poorer than the previous visit We will not be going again as the atmosphere is very loud with sport on TV s and the thought that if your not liked by owners or staff things may happen to your order has seriously put us off made it seem like a backstreet pub from the archives not suitable for kids with the language widely used 
negative, New restaurant so thought should be ok Staff on arriving were friendly But disappointed to find they didn t serve draft soft drinks only small expensive bottles While waiting for food noticed that the floor was generally messy with bits of food saw no one attempt to sweep in hour we were there  Also kitchens are on the wrong side of the restaurant and all waste has to be taken through the dinning area to the back exit and unfortunately we were sat on that route When food arrived looked ok but noticed that the burger seemed a bit juicier than expected On bitting into it the burger it actually turned out to be uncooked and raw in the centre   They quickly changed it for another which was ok but in the mean time chips etc went cold waiting for replacement Staff not that bothered that they were serving raw meat and when it came to paying the bill they charged full price and when asked by the waitress sorry server  if every thing was ok I repainted out that I was served raw meat and she just laughed and said oh sorry and walked away   Overall not the best experience I have had poor customer service and unhygienic food First and last visit Would have been better off going to McDonald s or Burger King 
negative,I walked into to the pub got a nice welcome from the staff and was shown to my table quickly After we sat down there s where it went wrong The staff never smiled once and may of seen the manager having a go at a member of staff for talking to customers We had to wait 15 minutes before they would take our drinks order and a further 20 minutes for food order The food was substandard and very expensive for the quailty I believe that part of my vegatable were under cooked and didn t enjoy After we finished our low quailty meal we ordered some deserts and the ice-cream had already melted before it reach our table We spoke to the manger and he gave us a responce which was invailed and not help full We would never eat here again after our experience and i recommended thinking twice before coming to the Deddington Arms for dinner 
negative, We visited for a friends birthday dinner 23 11 2015 Staff were surely that was the French bit the menu was saved because a large proportion of it was Italian food  and it was all presented as tapas style yet they presented themselves as outr€÷ French so in summary very confused for a restaurant The sommelier immediately tried to palm us off with a 180 bottle of Italian white we asked for a French suggestion we were in a Je suis Paris mood and the bread one slice arrived after much hand waving The ma€¸tre d a lady needs a lesson in client facing She had a face like thunder and announced there is no fish tonight Not I am sorry but   When asked why only one plate came out of the kitchen in 20 minutes - we were told that is how it works It would be helpful to explain this to guests at the start So we all ate a different times had to keep asking for bread  water  wine The escargot were just that The Veal chop was very good but at that price it better be Overall I would not recommend this restaurant It relies on the fact that it is in Mayfair and caters to the wealthy Well looking at the type of clientele whilst wealthy I think an educated guess is that they wouldn t know their burrata from the beurre and prefer to drink mint tea rather than wine But such restaurants don t get away with it in my book- If you are going to be that expensive get your s***t together and teach your staff some basic manners In time it will close I am sure For London does have options Oh yes I forgot  there are ripe tomatoes on the table with a lemon and some olive oil- the idea is you cut it up and make yourself a tomato salad while you wait for ever Next time there won t be I ll bring my own pots and cook myself a decent Italian meal at La Petite Maison 
negative, Was about to go into wetherspoons accross the road from here for generic vegetarian breakfast but then thought to myself i should support a local business and try something else Paying 7 80 for my Lemon Jelly vegetarian breakfast i was hoping for something a little bit special but what I got was a real let down Nuked hash browns tasted of tainted deep fat fryer fried potatoes blitzed just the same with no seasoning one manky egg tinned tomatoes ridiculously large amount of cheap beans one disgusting dry veggie sausage they forgot the mushrooms and when i asked for these they came out still bubbling having been zapped in the microwave and were clearly straight out of a tin and dripping in oil Absolutely disgusting me and totally not what my hangover was needing i pushed it round the plate for a bit then set off to find some gum to get the taste out of my mouth  This place is full of bohemian trinkets and makes out like its some artisan speakeasy when the reality is its an un-clean thrird rate hovel knocking out ultra budget careless meals at rip off prices 
negative,Very poor  Went in on a whim  Should have spent a bit more and visited Gourmet Burger Kitchen down the road Still you live and learn  Seated ok and ordered the double BBQ Texan burger fries and coke Service quick however things started to go rapidly downhill from there  Food arrived and a quick nibble of the fries found them to be cooked ok but cold I opened the very dry bun to view unmelted cheese on a couple of very over cooked burgers  I attempted to put ketchup in the burger however the plastic tomato shaped bottle had a broken top and when squeezed the top fell off ketchup poured out uncontrollably The top would not screw back in properly  Once I had removed copious amounts of ketchup from my burger and hands looked like I had just committed some sort of gruesome murder I took a bite of the burger The bun was very poor quality and broke apart after the first bite The meat was so overdone it was a chore getting through it and the Coke tasted like water if you re going to water the drinks down please don t make it too obvious   I ate it as I was hungry but it wasn t an enjoyable experience I advised the waiter that the the ketchup bottle was broken He just said  oh I m sorry about that  but didn t take it away from the table just left it there for the next poor victim  As someone else stated this joint is aimed at the 16-21 demographic who don t know any better  That was 45 minutes and a tenner I ll never get back Honestly spend a bit more and go to Gourmet Burger Kitchen for a quality burger experience 
negative, I was a guest at a corporate dinner so not really able to complain The main course was a lamb chop which was almost raw OK - I know that s fashionable for some unaccountable reason and so tough it was practically inedible The rest was mediocre at best Service was OK reception good - but that didn t compensate I ve been to numerous celebrity chef restaurants in London - happily always at someone else s expensive and this is definitely the worst dining experience I ve had 
negative, Not a bad wine bar  food good  shame about the manager and staff  and the 2 large glass s of Chablis  26 00   
negative, Very nasty low grade stuff called food Was it cooked Hard to call it that Was it served with care No way A pleasant meal - no way AVOID 
negative,Visited the harvest moon tonight and was hugely disappointed I went for the safe option of fish and chips which almost every pub manages to do well and was presented with a miserable piece of flat chewy fish encased in a thin bland batter A handful of pale chips and lukewarm mushy peas was the perfect accompaniment A waste of money
negative, Although there are a number of different elements to a cooked breakfast none of the individual components are particularly complicated  I popped into the Yenton this morning for a breakfast I was the only one in there and nobody else showed up during the time of my stay I wonder if the locals know something I don t I ordered the sizzling breakfast This is served on a bed of potato and onion hash My error here because in my minds eye I had pictured mash potato mixed with onion something similar to perhaps a corned beef hash what arrived was diced potato and sliced onions swimming on a bed of oil- which creates the sizzling effect the pub chain is infamous for Never for one minute did I imagine that my breakfast would arrive sizzling like one of their steaks but it did Moreover the hash content accounts for approximately 50 of the breakfast  I waited for the sizzling to die down before tipping the baked beans out of their jug Immediately they began to fry in the oil and I had to wait a little longer for them to settle down  But what of the rest of the breakfast It was all well cooked The bacon tasted of onion The sausages tasted of onion The eggs tasted of onion The tomato tasted of onion The mushrooms tasted of onion and the baked beans  they tasted of onion I never did try the hash  The service was prompt although I did get the feeling they weren t expecting me or anyone else  Nobody took the slightest interest in asking if the meal was okay nor did they question anything when they took away a plate of food that wasn t much less than what was served  It s a real pity as the pub itself is spacious and comfortable Their problem is that there must be at least a dozen other places in the locality that serve breakfast and having tried most of them I conclude this is the worst breakfast in the Erdington Wylde Green Boldmere area 
negative, I live close to Hampstead and have been coming to Maison Blanc to buy my bread and pastries for the last 20 years and occasionally for tea I remember the time when the staff was mostly French students and the service very good The quality of the bread remains good  the prices have gone up excessively and the service has become absolutely SUBSTANDARD It is already a challenge to get served if you want to buy at the counter If you sit down you are lucky if you are aknowledged after 25 minutes and served within one hour Last Sunday we waited 45 minutes after placing our order and repeatedly enquiring about it and then we walked away It appears to be a combination of understaffing and non-existant staff training Do not give your custom and money to this establishment but to somebody else and there are many that deserves it 
negative, Terrible place As others have said pretentious food  terrible atmosphere You know you have stumbled into the wrong place when it has security which looks like the Hells Angels dressed in black This is a restaurant in Hertfordshire why on earth would it need security - let alone so much Soon found out The establishment have very rude arrogant staff In particular the door men During our visit  I witnessed one of the door men being rude and arrogant towards a customer  and then at the end of the night actually punch the customer in the back of the head Yes- this actually happened I have not ever been to a restaurant club bar where the security actually strike the customers Maybe the customer complained about the staff Needless to say I won t be going back Avoid at all costs 
negative, The food was cold and salty and the service was good the Yorkshire puddings were soggy and the mash was lumpy and we had to wait 5 minutes for the chef to carve the meat 
negative, Over half an hour wait for 5 rather simple meals soup 2 x chicken wraps bacon roll and a cheese toastie The chicken was dry My tea was stone cold when my radio active soup arrived We were outside when it started to drizzle the manageress just looked on whilst chatting away when we attempted to put the brolly up Someone did come out to help But needed a handle the manageress was still chatting away inside Poor service not just for us the poor chap behind us faired worse as they d lost his order completely My advice a packed lunch would be a better plan 
negative, I can safely sat that I had the worst meal ever in Olives restaurant Colchester Was out with a friend and we both had the Greek fave Stiffado We were presented with a red looking soup with near to raw onions and 4 bits of meat We both wanted veg but they didn t have any so opted for chips The chips had been part cooked and were dry and shrivelled The worst part is that the Chef thought it was ok to serve up as a 13 main and when I quizzed him what on earth he thought this dish was he found it amusing and only had one dish left so split it into two   nice touch then added a load of water to it  Run this fool out of town 
negative, I was left starving after finishing my pathetic starter sized portion of veggie Quesadilla which annoyingly cost just as much as my friends giant meat options Also the menu left a lot to be desired as far as vegetarian options were concerned 
negative, Where do I start The finger sandwiches were dry scantly filled with the thinnest cheese I had ever seen They were also triangles not fingers but that pails to insignificance to the lack of taste to the sandwiches the lack of strength to the coffee The cakes were ok but they had run out of one of our choices  In short very over priced for what it was and clearly playing on the Austen name There are many other places to get tea in Bath I wish I had paid to go to the pump rooms than eat this debacle 
negative, Went there for food and drinks stood at the lounge bar and the barmaid ignored us four times server others who had just walked after us so I would not recommend this place and won t be going back there again 
negative,My partner and I ate at the swan for the first time on the evening of sat 14 June and i can honestly say that I will never return In short the pub is tatty and threadbare and the food was terrible and expensive My partner order the stroganoff and I had the lamb casserole Whilst the food was brought to us quickly the quality was appalling The stroganoff had a woman s long hair in it and was glutinous and tasteless The casserole was a tasteless mash of cheap mechanically recoverd lamb flesh and potatoes accompanied by reheated vegitables Truly the worst meal ever  The pub itself is in desperarate need of being refurbished The carpet in the lounge bar was threadbare and frayed The tables and chairs were old and worn The tables had not been cleaned when we arrived and we had to use the paper napkins to wipe the tables down as the staff did not seem to see presentation and cleanliness as part of service from a pub  All on all a terrible pub and best avoided
negative, I live locally to this pub and have visited it often over the years In the last month I have visited the pub twice with friends and family for meals  The service is was poor on the first visit and some items on the quite limited menu were not available  On the second visit the service was even worse The personnel at this pub don t seem to have basic manners and have never heard of please and thank you Again there were choices on the menu which were not available Only half the order arrived and help was ultimately found in the kitchen as no serving staff could be found to assist One of the dishes was inedible  I spoke to the manager but he has not heard of customer service and certainly has no understanding of the concept of apology  It seems to me that the pub is very poorly managed by people with little or no experience of hospitaliy and even less knowledge of customer service  If you just want a pint I m sure it will be fine but if you are intending to eat avoid this pub until further notice 
negative, Had a poor lunch experience with my work colleague Not many customers in the restaurant and the service was still poor The food was average and very little presentation  Lunchtime special advertised but no menu provided inside very confusing  Hygienically the toilets are not cleaned like most places you can tell how clean a restaurant is by the toilets This place could do well but requires more attention at the correct times 
negative, Harvester loves to advertise their unlimited breakfast 7 days a week so I figured I d check it out I arrived a few minutes after opening time only to be told that they were all out of hot food followed by a bunch of excuses why nobody had gone for more before opening time Pretty much the most pitiful thing that can happen in an establishment whose business model is to sell food never mind at the start of the day Not impressed thanks for wasting my time  
negative, Starters were very nice to begin with but it all went down hill from there onwards Extremely slow for mains and the staff were more bothered about playing on there phones I then decided to go to the toilet but instead walked into a little asain family tucked up in bed which was very unexpected The curry was watery and rice was very dry which was vulgar  I ordered a drink which came in a dirty glass i found this very unhygienic would advise against this restaurant I m sure they are very hardworking but the quality an standard off the restaurant just isn t there I recommend Indian Flava or Ahmeds which are located on the same road 
negative,My boss took me and the guys out for lunch and whilst I enjoyed it going down I didn t enjoy it coming out Like my Chinese but sorry wont recommend this place but guess other s may enjoy it 
negative,Do not go here took them long enough to take our order let alone serve our food Took well over an hour for our food to arrive with no warning or apology One of our party left because it was taking that long and they refused to let me leave until i paid for his food blocking me from leaving the restaurant for ten minutes whilst they ignored the rest of their grumpy customers When the food arrived it was poor quality incredibly mild despite asking for medium hot and lacking any real flavour I love Indian food and living in London often go to tooting which is the hidden home of curry I can only recommend that you try everywhere to get a table before heading here 
negative, Dont bother trying to get in if your male It seems to be optional to them to let men in  We werent drunk or dressed like yobs I d suggest to steer well clear  Absolutely disgusting   being on call lane and not letting men in can only make you wonder if the management are homophobic 
negative, Well what can I say After perusing all available restaurants in the area we were staying we plumped for this place The website looked promising But overall  not a good choice The service  most attentive The beer  good The food  I had to check my shoes to see if they have used the soles for the steak dish dreadful hard overcooked and tasteless The fish was certainly cooked  from frozen  tuna should never be associated with this eatery and neither should the replacement salmon Both were very dry overcooked and looked so forlorn on the plate The dish of vegetables  minus serving spoons  was plonked-cold-in the middle of the table We felt so deflated The wine helped to wash this fresh food down but I would never contemplate going to this restaurant again Caveat emptor 
negative, Overpriced vulgar food rude staff and extremely unclean   Avoid avoid avoid  Have no suggestions for improvement needs to be closed down and start again 
negative,We visited last year and were appalled at how poorly this business was run there was a wedding tent in the field so all the drinks pumps were in there and you could not get a drink unless you wanted a cider in a bottle We ordered a meal and my father in law s steak was 50 50 fat and meat I ordered a steak with pepper sauce which was all the female chef could make in sauces my steak arrived without the sauce so I asked is my sauce coming  the reply I got from the so called chef was it s pointless now you ll have eaten yer steak by the time yer sauce is ready  Our friends went for a hog roast sandwich party the next evening and got cold pork sandwiches which had most probably been left over from the wedding hog roast the evening before BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE 
negative,Two friends and I visited The Encore on Monday 3rd June 2013 at 17 35 prior to seeing a show at The Mayflower Although the bar was crowded there were several empty tables I managed to order our food at 17 49 and the bar staff didn t say that there would be a delay before the food arrived The other tables soon filled up Two of our meals arrived 55 minutes after we d ordered However the third meal a steak didn t arrive until 18 57 This last meal should have included mushrooms - but it didn t I was going to complain at this stage but the bar was then extremely crowded and there seemed to be very few bar staff The people at the next table actually received their food before we did although they had ordered after us There didn t seem any logical reason why other tables were also receiving their meals before we did On finishing our food two of us went to the loo and whilst we were there the people on the next table complained to the manageress and were given a refund Unfortunately there wasn t time for us to complain as we then had to rush to the theatre If you are going to to eat at The Encore I would suggest you should allow at least 2 hours The last time we visited this pub was in 2012 when the food also took far too long to be served We won t be going there again William Dawson 
negative,I ve been to this place to order a pizza and was served for a very grumpy middle aged bald man who clearly had no customer services skills whatsoever Of course you wouldn t expect a 5 star service in a mediocre place like this however the gentleman not sure if I should call him that didn t even thank me and made me feel that I was getting the pizza for free Horrible service 
negative, Decided to give koyla a try last Sunday never again The venue is massive probably one of the biggest in Leicester however wasnt busy at all when we visited Ordered burger meals for the kids each had to open the bun as no filling was visible tiny chicken fillet with bun three times the size Ordered mixed grill lamb chops weren t lamb it was mutton kebab was also mutton no wings tandoori chicken on a mixed grill Most of the items on the mixed grill hadn t been grilled tiny portions of each and tasteless Chicken karahi had little or no chicken in it just tasteless curry sauce Chicken steak was tiny portion with tasteless mushroom sauce Cheesy chips covered in cheap wholesale cheese which wasn t cheesy at all Kids didn t find burger meal filling so ordered a further two kids meals chicken pieces with chips was expecting chicken strips however we got tiny chicken pieces deep fried 25 chicken 75 batter kids hated both their meals I am trying to be positive but food quality wise there is nothing good about Koyla they are awful you will find better food at local takeaways For all my trouble the bill came to 55 00 wow crap food at expensive prices with tiny portions  don t waste time and money going to Koyla 
negative, We booked this place for a staff do as it seemed the menu catered for everyone but they neglected to say - 70 of your food will be deep fried and you ll have to guess which is which oh and the rest is chips   Vegetarians beware Actually anyone with taste buds beware - even Scott said it was awful and he s a gannet We had a great time because the booze was cheap and the group dynamic worked We could have had 14 square pizza EACH for the same price down the road with change for a pint Never been a fan of Wethers  s and this trip didn t change my mind 
negative, Reception was frosty at best White guy with the bald head if management are reading or care Had to wait for 5 minutes for our table while others walked in without delay but hey they re busy I understand  Sat down to be told you understand how this works  well no we ve never been before but the waiter reiterated his mantra a few times Fortunately we ve been to buffet style places like this before so yes  we know how this works  ie Get your own sides salad and then wait for the meat to be bought round   We visited the sides bar which was generally good although waiting for the meat was horrendous Considering we paid ~ 26 a head minus drinks  the amount of times the meat guys came round was awful and when they did they shaved off very small portions Towards the end of the meal I felt like they were avoiding us perhaps because they wanted the table back we d been an hour at this point  In fact I m being polite they WERE avoiding us I actually had to shout after the waiters for the meat as they served all of the tables around us yes our green paddles were up  At one point my wife had to leave her seat as a waitresses with the dessert tray wanted to get through  That same waitress when ordering a drink told us that there was no way you could order a rioja from the bar by the glass despite getting one 15 minutes ago We settled for a couple of glasses of malbec which of course turned out to be rioja when they turned up -P In terms of the main attraction the meat  well the portions were small and tough In summary this place is very middle of the road with sub par food and service that leaves our local Hungry Horse look amazing Pretty awful 
negative, Looking forward to a superb christmas lunch we were very dissapointed The Turkey if indeed if it was Turkey appeared to be from a preformed meat roll which tasted more of pork than anything Potatoes were cold and burnt sausage raw Need we say more Worst Christmas lunch we have had 
negative, Very poor service as the first customer I was rewarded with sitting right next to a pile of tables  Food is awful desert is just Mr Kipling slices and the chocolate cake is next door in Iceland for 1  Service was shocking we were guided in like cattle and all squashed together despite there being lots of free space in the restaurant  I was only allowed to have the drinks menu for about 5 minutes before it was stolen by the staff for another table I think there was only 1 in the whole place  Drinks are limited and you have to go to the bar yourself there is no drinks to table service  Cash payments only  Food was poorly cooked unseasoned bland dry just uninteresting 1 star 
negative, Our appetizers came with many flaws too many to list but as an example the chilli that garnished the plate had mold in it We told the manager and we have this impression that its not the first time he heard about this before at the restaurant possibly due the quality of the food maybe Nevertheless he listened and even invited us to the drinks we had ordered and were going to pay for We decided not to stay any longer to find out how the second course is going to be and move to the pub up the road 
negative, Do not waste your time with this appalling venue  The food is horrendous  The customer service is despicable  The management clearly do not know what they are doing  I came here with some friends a while back for some food and drink and the food was late cold uncooked and quite honestly a joke  I won t be coming here again and I suggest that you don t too 
negative, ordered 2 x fish suppers to eat in waited 20 minutes both fish were very small in portion and breaded coating huge to disguise fish size chips all covered in grease and mostly small chips as if left overs were being served including tea for two 20 complained to management and paid for one meal only guess what will definitely not be back 
negative, We were told by the man on the till that there would be a 20 minute wait Not a good start Went to the cutlery and there were three knives left two of which were not just dirty they still had food attached Within minutes of sitting down with one knife between us it became clear that something was seriously wrong The lady behind us had been waiting almost ONE HOUR for food and there was no food exiting the kitchen in fact it appeared there was no cook She challenged the man on the till and demanded to see a manager Without her fortitude we may still be waiting now but thankfully our meals arrived just over 45 minutes later The food was good - considering - and the waiter apologised to everyone but too little too late I m afraid Never again 
negative, The meal was massively salty pizza very black and burnt waitress said  will mention it to the chef  - that was it       
negative, Went to try the newest bar in Norton and very disappointed  Do you have any Magners - No Do you have any Blue WKD - No Well I will have a pint and a half of draught cider then - That ll be 6 60 Drunk up and went to Wetherspoons and Magners 2 09 a bottle I will never visit again 
negative, i dont think the lady wanted to be working only two customers and you can see why lady was unfriendly food was okay but to much for what you get i wouldnt go back for food 
negative, Overpriced Inedible meatballs Long wait  Wouldn t recommend to know one they only get away with because of the location 
negative, Long wait to place order long wait then for food Food had actually been cremated  So called manager flippant about the food complaint behind the customers back No wonder this chain are in trouble NEVER AGAIN 
negative, We booked this restaurant for a table for four on a Saturday night all well and good We arrived and asked the staff about our booking and they replied with oh we already have a table taken in that name she asked me my phone number which I left when we booked the table she said yes that s you but someone has your table The waitress then went and asked the party that had stolen my table to leave but they refused so we were left without a table there were 2 tables spare which they didn t offer to push together although it may have been a bit awkward They just told us we could return later by which time it would have been around 10 so we declined and had a delicious meal at the Ghurka restaurant over the road 
negative, Food was lukewarm and bland  A party of four     Sheek kebab starter was almost tasteless only saved by the fact we had kept the pickle tray and were thus able to make it palatable  Main courses somewhat insipid - one of the chicken dishes was like chewing leather and the Lamb Rogan Josh was almost bereft of meat which was dry and chewy  The worst part was that one of our party ordered a chicken main course    on cutting a piece of the meat it was discovered she had been served lamb my friend only eats chicken fish  We called over a waitress who merely said OH  and walked away A waiter arrived and asked what the problem was    without speaking further he turned and walked away    then another waiter arrived and said it was their mistake surprise surprise we knew what we ordered and it would take some time to cook the correct dish as the restaurant was busy We told him we couldn t wait as we had an appointment to make So his response was I ll leave the lamb with you otherwise I ll just take it away and bin it And as a parting remark he added I won t charge you for it  No offer to provide an alternative no offer of a drink on the house    my friend was left without a main course  So if you love bland food poor customer service and a couldn t care less attitude this is the place you have been looking for 
negative,Visited the Maynard Arms this week with my family thought we would try lunch Tables were very sticky obviously wiped with an old beer cloth Asked for lunch menu was told to wait while they printed us 4 from upstairs In the meantime we ordered 4 coffees which were luke warm When the menus arrived we found the prices to be quite expensive so we asked if they did a lunch menu we were told they have sandwiches Beef and horseradish @ 7 each    mmmmm 28 for 4 sandwiches I think not  Needless to say we left and will not be returning Maynard Arms - maybe ok for evening drinking sessions but forget the food  unless you want to eat overpriced sandwiches on sticky tables An absolute shower
negative, Service was shocking one waiter kept shouting over tables took forever to get the food never offered more drinks When food came it was rank and now my toilet is paying the price 
negative, I ordered online despite the expensive prices compared to others and the delivery charge on top I was quoted a 45 minute wait on the website and got a confirmation on the website but no email After 1 1 2 hours I called to see where my food was and was put on hold for 5-10 mins only to be told that they could not find my order They offered to cook it for me at the top of the queue and deliver it but that it would be more than 30 mins I told them not to bother as I would use a local St Albans takeaway instead That food arrived before the expedited Paya order would have arrived 
negative, One problem with this place is that they refuse to take bookings which if you like dining later in the evening leaves you very little option if you are turned away For some strange reason it is very popular but when we finally did manage to get a table we found the menu slightly more adventurous than most however portions were not generous and I believe overpriced The worst thing about this gastro-pub is the rude and obnoxious landlord who seems to think he s doing you a great favour by allowing you to cross his threshold With so many other places to eat in the area we certainly won t be returning 
negative, Sadly nowadays Browns smacks of a complacent understaffed overpriced and ultimately way below par chain For a proven chain by the river hop over Eton bridge to Cote Brassiere If you re looking for anything else there are endless superior options up the high street  The 14 Sunday roast was cold and all the vegetables seemed like they d been sitting around for hours Paid an extra 1 50 for pigs in blankets  and received one sausage see photo  If Browns want to charge these prices they seriously need to up their game and fast Local independents like The Alma and Sebastian s Italian walk over their current offering with far better quality and value  
negative, There s a burger bar in a lay-by very close to the pub View just as good food much better As many others have said the management don t seem to care that the place is filthy The food was poor and the sorry about that comment from the waitress was as tired as the year-old fish on my plate 
negative, Visited for a quiet drink and a meal  I m sure its great if you are a local but not very welcoming and despite what the website states don t expect food after 2030 because that s what time the kitchen shuts - allegedly  Website states 2100 on a Friday and we got there at 2040 to be told kitchen shut even though one local was half way through a meal and another had a plate of hot food brought out to them at 2045  We definitely wont be going back 
negative, I m afraid we didn t read any reviews before purchasing Cod n chips twice Not sure about the Cod bit it was not white or flakey  The Cod was oozing oil when we ate it there was so much oil the fish had turned translucent the fish fillet was very skinny By contrast the chips amazingly were dry - some achievement that   I am not a master fryer that makes two of us  but I suspect that the oil was not hot enough it took a very long while to arrive This may be the cause of the greasiness  Considering that this place has been around for years I would have thought the proprietors would have perfected this frying game by now - it seems NOT 
negative,  we witnessed a fight when we arrived around 6ish on a Saturday and the victim narrowly missed our table as he was sent reeling across the bar with a punch then a bit later on we were threatened by a pair of aggressive drunk meat-heads so we left Staff were lovely pub looks lovely but the drinks are ridiculously over-priced and the customers look like something out of TOWIE but more drunk and more likely to lash out  Never again
negative, THERE IS A CAR PARKING SCAM OPERATING HERE  100 FINE IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO MAKE A PURCHASE I m a regular user of the A303 but have been hit with a 100 automated parking fine for stopping at the Micheldever Services To make things worse I ve been away and the penalty has become overdue meaning that there is no early payment discount and I assume I cant now contest it  Please note that this diner is Signposted as a Service area but it seems use of the services is dependant on you actually buying something I parked up walked in  didn t see any supposidly prominent signage used the facilities didn t fancy the food and drove away In all I was parked for 5 minutes  I don t see how the system can tell if purchases are made and can only assume the management note any customer that doesn t decide to eat there and earmarks his registration for the fine So there is no means of checking the menu without the 100 fine   Looking at earlier posts it seems the manager has rudely accosted potential customers in the car park if they don t spend money with him Now he has found a more lucrative way of penalising those that decide not to eat there  I will give the local police station a call as Im sure they will know all about it by now It seems that this kind of parking system may not be enforcable by law and we may be able to simply ignore it  this is the case with a lot of town centre supermarkets that try to protect their parking spaces in this way The fine supposedly goes up to 150 if I do so but it might be worth the risk for those that follow  I will report back with another review I have not reviewed the food but have commented on value for money service and atmosphere as they are directly associated to the dreadful management  I m on the A303 on Tuesday so will park up at the happy eater over the road avoiding another 100 fine and photograph the Prominent signs if I can find them Ill also ask for the manager and see what he or she has to say about their parking scene  Will report back with another review of course Next step will be to send this Tripadviser page to our friends at BBC watchdog They will love to send a camera crew down to have a look  IN THE MEANTIME I URGE YOU TO DRIVE PAST THIS MEAN SPIRITED ESTABLISHMENT 
negative,Had a Caesar Salad for lunch The souroundingss are good but the food did not taste very fresh and I felt unwell for a few days after I would not go back 
negative, Im loathed to givevthis place one star we called in last nightbfor a take away the place was very quiet anyway we ordered got home found that we had not been given the correct meal we were minus a satay   we dished out found the shumai not cooked infact the pork was raw   the rice was okay although the special rice dish was very poor  Overall we will not be back here ever 
negative, Visited with work for a quick lunch A lot was sold out so we opted for a fried chicken special it was awful truly had I know they are students but still   When we said how poor the food was we were told it was because it was a special so hadn t been cooked before  We were still expected to pay if it wasn t a college and they were students there s no way we would have Not going back 
negative, Ordered a carvery but it was the worst experience I have ever had The meat portions are a joke and the woman scowls at you if you have to do an interpretation of Oliver Twist and dare to ask for some more The vegetables looked very tired and had been there for some time Overall a very bad experience and we will not be returning until someone else with Restaurant experience is running the place 
negative, On Saturday 6th April I took my wife Son Daughter and Son Inlaw to the living room to celebrate my wifes 60th birthday When we arrived the doors were held open by two men on the door who at first made us feel very welcome but then I noticed that they had stopped my 29 year old son and were looking in his bag They then refused to let him in because of his footwear They said they were trainers but the were black pumps not trainers I told them they were being ridiculous We left and went next door into Browns where we were made very welcome I spent 85 in drinks alone in Browns if the Livingroom does not need the money they are going the right way about it as none of us will be going back there 
negative, Having been before the service was ok until we returned on our visit to London on 26th December the food was not the same and a member of staff had cleared the table before even asking and would not answer when i asked why she had cleared out table and drinks we had not finished she was rude and found the staff was not that friendly at all would not go back again 
negative, A friend and I saw a Groupon deal of 25 off the total bill so we decided to give it ago When we were seated we showed the deal they refused to accept it saying the code wasn t working so I gave them another code from the same app on my phone and they still wouldn t except it After placing our order to the rudest staff I ve experienced in a restaurant we waited for almost an hour to bring the warm slop they call food to the table Once that was kept down some how we asked for the bill the service charge isn t optional good job them as no one would tip I then PAID I gave the money to the waiter and then went to walk out the waitress shouted across the restaurant YOU HAVEN T PAID  With the restaurant looking at us I pointed to the waiter I gave the money too and she turned her back to us and walked off This place is the worst Restaurant  if you can call it that I have ever eaten in Save your money and go to any other place its Brighton there are plenty of restaurants to choose from 
negative, Came here for dinner in the evening and definitely won t be returning Not for food anyway Had a decent pint and the place seems to have a good atmosphere for somewhere to go for a drink but the food is rubbish  I had steak and chips and the chips were pretty much inedible Steak wasn t great had lots of fatty bits and not the tastiest steak I ve ever had Badly presented too My fianc€÷e had the gourmet burger There was nothing gourmet about it It looked pretty awful and didn t taste much better than it looked There were some of the listed ingredients missing too  We left most of the food and had to have toast when we got home to make up for it  Rubbish Should have known when we had to peel open the menu which had obviously had many a drink spilt on it in the past 
negative, Thought we d give it a go despite some mediocre reviews - sorry we did  General shambolic service and mediocre food sums it up Took ages to take our order starter plates left for 15mins + and mains arrived whilst plates still on table We heard the chef ring the bell at least 5 times whilst our pizzas were sitting waiting to be served  And lo and behold when the days pizzas arrived they were cold and of course 1 was wrong  Surly manager dealt with it in stroppy way as he did with another table who complained about cold food  When correct pizza arrived was pretty void of any taste  Asked for bill twice and it took ages Have feedback to manager who clearly shouldn t be in hospitality and obv this wasn t well received  Other tables around us had similar issues  A truly dreadful place that is not cheap and needs a serious rethink overhaul   
negative, Horrible little pub Went there for a cup of tea and was met with a dirty depressing room Coffee was awful Staff unbelievably sour and rude Avoid this place at all costs would give it 0 if I could 
negative,My husband and I visited this restaurant on the 17th Oct We was very disappointed the atmosphere here is totally wrong The staff do not seem bothered if you have to wait to be served as we saw 4 staff members standing around the bar talking There was not a lot to choose from on the menu and the food we did have was a let down I had the marguerita pizza which cost 7 95 and it was dry and chewy The spaghetti Bolognese for 9 45 was filling but had hardly any meat and the meat it did have was under all the spaghetti We had 3 scoops of ice cream for dessert each and that took forever to arrive and then cost 9 50 I wouldn t recommend this restaurant and we will not being going back 
negative,First visit and last visit to the Sukhothai restaurant whilst eating the spicy prawn crackers discovered a long dark hair in my mouth on telling the waitress a cursory apology was offered should have left then  but decided to order big mistake prawn tom yum soup was mainly flavoured with hard raw pieces of ginger chosen curry was no better ginger once again with the addition of whole raw chillies probably one of the worst meals I have ever had  
negative,Thought I would try this place but was surprised that when I ordered an apple juice I got a Child s portion and then had to wait over 20 minutes for a burger fries and slaw To be honest the burger meat tasted like it came from a can Over 13 was a BIG price I would suggest BK or Mickey D s next time you fancy a burger save time money and get a better burger 
negative, I have been to San Carlo a few times and despite this being one of Manchester s most highly regarded places to eat i will never ever go back again  The food isn t all that bad I suppose though when asked to put Palma ham on a pizza we were given the sort of wet packet ham one would expect in a Tesco caf€÷  The real problem with this place is the service It is truly terrible I am sure if Ryan Giggs Shrek or any of the rest of there friends ate at San Carlo and judging from the tacky photographs on the wall they often do you would be treated like a king However if you are lucky enough to be a mere mortal and don t go to work wearing red or blue strip you re a nobody and are treated at best as minor incontinence  So unless you have just been signed by Sir Alex or have the misfortune to resemble Shrek don t bother with San Carlo as all you will served with is a healthy dose of contempt 
negative, We arrived at the restaurant around 5 00pm in the afternoon on an evening in which we had planned a date night Upon arrival the staff were friendly and keen to seat us We were promptly served drinks and were given time to place our order and was very happy with the service so far  Around ten minutes after ordering our food it was delivered to us in a efficient manner with no omissions However we had only received our starters and around half way through eating them our mains were given to us without prior question as to whether we had finished our starters and were ready for our mains This was something that really put us off wanting to eat the main as we hadn t finished the first course One meal that was ordered was the Steak and Rib Combo - upon starting to eat and cut into the steak I discovered that it was in fact cooked medium to rare instead of being cooked medium to well after asking specifically for my steak to be cooked more on the well done side than medium  I pointed this out to another server and they apologised and quickly took my meal away to be re-cooked I received my replacement meal around 5-8 minutes afterwards and I checked my steak and this was cooked how it had been asked - which I was pleased about - HOWEVER upon finishing the steak I moved onto the ribs to find that these were under cooked and tasted bland and fatty I was really disappointed with this as I have had it many times before in other Harvester restaurants and this one in particular and have never been disappointed with a meal  I understand that there can be some changes in taste and cooking between Harvester restaurants but I did not think the quality could drop so drastically across the board  When having left 3 4 of the meal ribs chips and peas - only eating the steak the server came to collect our plates and asked if things were all right in which I responded with my disappointment I was also unhappy that nobody had done a check back with my replacement meal in which this situation could have been avoided  According to the server who is called Leanne there was nothing she could do about my meal as I had eaten a part of it which was acceptable and left that which was not - in which her response included the words You have eaten your meal so I cant do anything about that or give you a refund   With working in this industry - I understand the necessary protocols involved in dealing with an unhappy customer and I recognise that this was not one of them I did not get offered anything for free such as a drink or dessert and had to complain again before Leanne stated that the only thing she could do was take 20 off my meal on the bill  I accepted this reluctantly as my partner and I had other things planned for our date night so we then asked for the bill Upon receiving the bill - we then waited a whole 21 minutes for anyone to even realise or respond to our call about the money we were paying with and this made us extremely late for our other engagements as we did not simply want to walk out and not pay at all  We are extremely disappointed in the service and food - from Leanne in particular and we shall be reluctant to visit this Harvest again anytime soon  As a side note - it is notable that the standard of food and service slips when you are not busy as at this time the restaurant had 3 tables in when we arrived and they had all being fed  Very very very disappointed 
negative, Tried to call in after a long walk on Tuesday 29 July at 1430 hours No sign of life despite hours advertised on door stating that it was open until 1500 hrs Annoying 
negative,I attended with a party of 28 for a lunch at this lovely looking public house in the picturesque village of Littlebourne Kent  That is as far as the favourable comments can extend On Tuesday 8th January 2013 I had pre-orders sausages eggs and chips followed by apple pie and custard  My main course arrived with two eggs which were not well cooked at all and which I sent back The plate came back with the eggs now cooked more thoroughly but from the length of time I would guess that the original two had simply been removed from my plate put in the fryer and then put back Unfortunately a lot of grease ended up on the plate with them so much so that the chips became soggy and inedible  Whilst this was taking place a member of the party at my table had still not been served his scampi and chips and didn t actually get it until some time after I had finished my first course  There were no apologies for either of these issues from either of the two waitresses who appeared very young inexperienced and to be perfectly honest clueless  The desert eventually arrived but I was told that they had run out of custard Then the custard magically arrived The pie was clearly a store or frozen food company product with that typical taste of processed filling as well as soggy pastry on the bottom Obviously not heated correctly In addition to that the clueless waitresses provided us all with a soup spoon for the desert and still didnt understand what wrong they had done when it was pointed out to them A soup spoon is fine for soup and for custard but not for an apple pie as well After the lunch I went to pay The landlord was behind the bar smiling expectantly and then asked what I thought of the apple pie I was not over enthusiastic about giving the feedback but he invited comment and I told him I wish I hadn t because at the merest hint of a criticism he went off into a big explanation about how cheap the meal was and that he had provided a meal for 28 people which was not usual for a lunch time I can understand why it is not usual to serve that many covers because the food and service are dire to say the least  My answer to this and any landlord or manager of any food outlet is that if you don t want feedback don t ask and if you do and get honest feedback please act on it so if that manager is reading this please do something about your dining facilities all round As for anyone reading this you go at your own risk as far as I am concerned 
negative, Visited London 24th April 2013 from Suffolk as a special treat for my wife & myself Attracted to enter Wolf s restaurant after reading outside menu offering fixed lunch for 10 95 Asked what we wanted to drink ordered wine for my wife Then given menu On perusal lunch menu was 18 50 Requested fixed menu on arrival of drink Informed fixed menu not on due to business booked lunches Complained to manageress on leaving immediately who by her demeanour could not have cared less about our predicament Outside menu was not changed DO NOT VISIT unless you have an expense account 
negative, On thing to say about Rare is that it looks bloody good The decoration is everything you would want from a Steak House naked brick walls wood everywhere a gaudy metal Bull and low lighting You feel like you re about to have a fantastic experience You aren t  The restaurant is fairly popular among locals and students of nearby Keele University and this is possibly more out of having nowhere else to go rather than actually enjoying the experience I feel therefore that now the restaurant has realised there isn t anywhere else for patrons to go that there is no reason to try and get customers to return The food is average at best the steaks are cooked to order  but somehow medium rare  medium and Rare all come out the same  No condiments were offered and with a young child at the table Ketchup was greatly missed However the cardinal sin of the Steak house was how much fat there was on one of our party s T-bone steak It was inedible and was sent back The other two steaks at the table were of good quality but unfortunately amateurly cooked More over they had not been left to rest and came swimming in juices causing everything else to be sodden It is however the service that is the real cause for concern Having to wave down a waitress like a taxi service in London every time a drink order was needed was simply unacceptable and one girl seemed determined to not have to engage with our table at all when at one point she did take our order her monosylabbic hosting was straight from the School of Basil Fawlty  The waitresses just seemed uninterested in serving and more interested in socialising with friends that were drinking at the bar Just when I thought it couldn t get much worse a couple were seated at the table next to us and had to ask for the table to be cleaned This in itself was horrendous but when Basil Fawlty appeared with a squirter and promptly squirted their table whilst they were sat in distance of spray back myself and the woman at the table shared a look of not knowing whether to laugh or leave It was unbelievable a damp cloth would have sufficed or perhaps a move to a more sanitary table in the almost empty restaurant but to literally moisten your guests is beyond reproach  As can be expected a tip was not left and I can only think that they must be on an extraordinary hourly wage as no effort was made whatsoever  For 3 adults starter and main with no alcohol one under 5 chicken nuggets and ice cream the bill came in at 98 which for what it was was inexplicably expensive New staff are needed I m afraid or massive retraining it felt like we had walked in to amateur hour and expected Gordon Ramsay to be sat in the corner shaking his head to appear at any moment There s so much potential for this restaurant but until the Steak house can find a chef that can cook a steak properly and some waitresses that are capable of waiting it will stay at the low level eatery it is I can t stress how much I want this restaurant to be good but it just isn t and the management would do well to read the reviews they are getting and act on them not try and continue what they are doing as it does not work 
negative, We were really looking forward to the jazz evening at Stanmer House It started well - a friendly greeting by nicely dressed polite staff and a drink in the bar When we were shown to our table it started to fall apart though  dim lighting made it difficult to read the menu the lack of soft furnishings like curtains meant there is nothing to soak up the sound so we were having to shout over the noise we had to share a long table with maybe 30 other people - that wasn t mentioned when we booked it We ended up moving to another room where we couldn t hear the music but at least we could hear each other Food Mushrooms on toast - a personal favourite - mushrooms were dirty gritty cold and tasteless so very disappointing I couldn t eat it The waiter was informed and he reported back from the chef that it was down to the preparation Steak - really nicely cooked and very tender It would have been better hot though Potato - lukewarm and it tasted reheated Kale greens - again stone cold Sticky toffee pudding - no complaints here - loved it Service - very polite and friendly but not enough of them so we were often waiting a long time to be dealt with Earphones also make the staff look like bouncers Overall we were very disappointed and we had a lousy evening We re not the sort of people to complain normally but this was a terrible evening the food was disappointing and the experience unpleasant We can t recommend the Stanmer House Jazz evening at all AVOID 
negative, Went to the labour in vain tonight with high hopes as we had heard that it had been turned around and was serving lovely food With all the positive reviews I had previously read we were looking forward to an enjoyable evening Both my partner and I were left highly disappointed due to slow service and poor quality food I myself am I chef - maybe not a michelen star chef but I am aware of value for food and good service To begin with we were greeted by a member of staff who did not seem to know where our reserved table was After he had eventually found it and we were seated we waited at least 10 minutes for the waiter to present us with the menu As he passed us the menu he informed us that service would possibly be a bit slower than usual as they also had a party of 20 to attend to on another table This was fine as he had informed us beforehand so we agreed to order He then took a further 15 minutes at least before coming back to us to take our order My partner chose the chicken ballentine and was thoroughly looking forward to it Unfortunately she had to choose an alternative after the waitress informed her that there was no chicken left Eventually she opted for the sirloin steak with a side of diane sauce After a long wait our meals finally arrived however my partner was told her sauce would take another few minutes to arrive - this was apparently due to the pot washer throwing away the sauce as he had assumed the pan was dirty Either the waitress made this up to cover the chef who may have forgotten it or the sauce really looked that bad the pot washer thought it needed throwing away When the so called diane sauce finally came it seemed to be more of a gravy-like consistency with a few added chopped mushrooms and pepper Her meal itself had gone cold as the sauce had taken so long to arrive and I had almost finished just as she was starting Her steak was fatty and most definitely not worth the price stated The only positive aspect was that it was cooked as she had asked and it was tender enough to eat I ordered the duo of pork which was edible but very dry and in need of a sauce Again not up to standards for the price we paid Once we had finished our meals the waiter came to the table and asked if it was ok to take our plates  he never once asked if we has enjoyed our meals Another 10 minutes or so later after a few glares from the staff the waitress came to offer dessert and more drinks To this we refused and requested the bill As we were about to pay she finally decided to ask if we had enjoyed our meals After explaining the issue with the steak she apologised and deducted 10 from the bill  Just a few pointers for staff to consider in the future - Saturday nights are one of the most busy nights of the week it is common sense to ensure a reasonable amount of staff are available - especially when you have a party of 20 in that particular night Secondly ensure the chef is able to handle the pressure of a busy demanding restaurant Aside from the party of 20 the restaurant was otherwise fairly quiet If tonight s service is anything to go by I dread to think what it would be like in busier times  All in all very disappointed customers A real let down after reading all the positive reviews beforehand Poor quality of food and slow unprofessional service Would not recommend 
negative, My previous reviews on 15th June 2014 and 20th June 2015 extolled the virtues of the Met New owners took charge earlier this year My last review on 7th July 2016 expressed concerns about the food  Having again visited the Met twice in late August I can only concur with the ever-growing Tripadvisor reviews that express dissatisfaction with a place that only recently was still enjoying its reputation as one of the go to dining venues on the island  How it has slumped in recent times The menu is now so restricted Why  The staff do not seem to be anywhere near as interested or friendly as the old guard Why  The quality of the food is patently in decline Why So disillusioned are we that we don t intend to spend another minute in the place until the current management wake up and sort out its obvious shortcomings Why is the Met slip sliding away like this I am not a competitor to the Met I am just a holidaymaker and they should be very concerned by these unflattering Tripadvisor reviews What does the management feel about these reviews Do they feel they are not genuine Do they intend to address or ignore their customers complaints  Tip for the management - get the old staff back to start with They were the embodiment of the place and made me want to come back again and again On one two-week holiday we dined at the Met 12 evenings out of 14 That s how good they were  I bear no malice to the new owners I just want the old Met back Please get a grip before the place is reduced to an empty shell The location of the Met on the sea front is wonderful but that alone is not sufficient The deficiencies need to sorted and quick We are genuinely concerned 
negative, We visited this restaurant with a kgb voucher with a face value of 51 for two people In spite of terms to the contrary within the voucher they insisted that we were only allowed to use a limited cheap budget Set Menu at approx  12 per head which we naturally declined  We do not like to use restaurants that appear to lack integrity and honesty 
negative, We will not be visiting this place again and would not recommend to anyone the owner Brenda behaved appallingly towards us We visited it to celebrate my sister in laws 50th birthday the meal was but not worth anything like what they charge the worse part was after our meal  My 11 year old daughter had just learned to play her first piece of music on piano and she offered to play this piece to her birthday girl aunt we asked the waitresses if this was ok and they were more than happy to allow and helped set a nearby piano up my daughter was playing her piece beautifully with her aunt at her side enjoying it when Brenda strolled up and put a stop to the music half way through it saying that use of the piano was not allowed We told her that her staff had agreed to us using it but this seemed to cut no ice whatever and she simply said they must not be aware of the ban on its use This is her problem not ours of course my daughter was mortified and embarrassed and my sister in law incandescent with rage we explained to Brenda that she was out of order as we had been given clear approval to play the piano and the waitresses could see it was for a very genuine and sweet reason by my daughter  if this is how Brenda sees fit to treat returning customers how had paid a lot of money for their night out then i believe all trip advisor users should know and should boycott this pub and teach these people that they cannot get away with treating customers in such a shabby way 
negative, Went last Sunday for the carvary wasn t very good the Turkey was reformed meat the Yorkshire pudding was soggy and flat hardly any veg will not be going again and for the price there s much better pubs just down the road caister castle to name one 
negative, Awful service - waitress miss-ordered several times and then spilt the red wine all over the table and then no one cleared it up When the wine finally made it to the glass it was off so I sent it back and called the manager Mario over to try to halt the catalogue of errors and change waitress  Mario s response was to pick a fight He told me the wine was perfectly OK  it was vinegar  I told him that if he attitude continued I would happily share my experience on-line you don t threaten me Mr was his delightful response  The food was very bad Chicken schnitzel stringy over-cooked and dry fish cake was tiny  Mario did apologise in the end Not before he ruined our evening response 
negative, Went here because my children wanted to  Maybe it s because this restaurant is new but I don t want to be your guinea pig  Arrived without a booking and were seated straight away  The decor is faux American  Took drinks orders and they took 20 minutes to arrive Then we ordered two children s meals and I order steak and frites with a blue cheese sauce  After around a further 30 minutes the food turned up and the sauce was clearly mushroom Questioned it and was told it was mushroom with blue cheese No It was mushroom I know mushroom sauce with zero cheese in it when I see it and taste it  There were only two sets on knives and forks on the table Despite there being three of us No more cutlery was forthcoming  The steak was cooked medium rare as requested But it was the cheapest fat ridden inedible steak I think I have ever tasted For 16 I don t expect Cafe de Paris but I do expect not to have to take take a pneumatic drill to it It was truly awful  Nobody came over to ask if our meal was OK  My daughter s Mac n Cheese was plastered in pepper and we ran out of drinks without anyone making any sort of eye contact  We had to ask someone to clear our table and I mentioned again that the virtually untouched sauce was clearly mushroom They went to the kitchen and again came back to tell me that the sauce was blue cheese and mushroom  When a third member of staff came over we were asked if we would like the bill Regardless of the fact that dessert came with the children s meal and we hadn t actually asked for the bill  Ordered two portions of ice cream  They took 30 minutes to come and arrived without spoons  We had to ask for spoons from the I m too cool to serve you girl behind reception  Ice cream finished it was then another 15 minutes before I had to go find someone to clear the table and give us the bill  The bill arrived and mushroom sauce was on it It wasn t what I ordered but hey they wanted their 1 95  I m fairly easy to please but this was arguably the worst restaurant I have ever been in The food was bland inedible the service was atrocious and prices did not reflect the poor quality on show  Oh And when the bill turned up apparently I had ordered mushroom sauce  Avoid  Avoid at all costs  Get a meal deal from Tesco a few doors down  Utterly utterly dreadful 1 out of 5 is being polite 
negative, Apologies for the lengthy review Not the norm from me but a lot to cover unfortunately Asked what draught beer they had and hearing Cobra said yes please I m sure I heard the bottle being opened out of sight because there were no pumps front of house We settled on Onion Bhaji and Sheek Kebab starters Rarely had either arrive without Yoghurt mint sauce before so asked for it The guy went 10 feet looked at his phone for a couple of minutes and forgot - Reminded when we caught his eye and he brought some Onion Bhaji s to be fair were OK Sheek Kebab not good As they had Vindaloo and Naga curries on the menu yes I like hot  asked which was hotter as both said Very Hot on menu Didn t seem too sure so I went for the Naga which was pretty hot but really just didn t taste nice flavour not heat  The Pilau rice was weird as well - just not like I m used to at other Indian restaurants and I eat at many nationwide Wife went for Chicken Tikka which again anywhere else arrives to the table sizzling and smelling fantastic Not here I m afraid and it didn t even look particularly appetising Pretty standard elsewhere it comes with Yoghurt mint sauce but had to ask again As you can imagine neither of us cleaned our plates  Just about to ask for the bill when 2 dishes of Ice Cream appeared We looked at each other and smiled At least they can t get that wrong I said  Some of it tasted it like vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce on but neither of us got half way through it as there was a strange texture to it that didn t taste of anything - My wife said get the bill quick before they bring anything else Bill arrived and was completely wrong as we were on a Groupon Same waiter had taken the printed details when we arrived and before we ordered even explaining what we could have as standard and or pay extra for if we wanted Seemed he forgot as they were obviously so busy Sarcasm as there was already another table of two when we arrived and another table of two arrived while we were eating  With the bill came several chunks of some form of chocolate It was quite obviously segments that had been broken off a whole bar of chocolate by hand Absolutely bizarre and neither of us touched it despite my wife s deep rooted passion for the stuff Got the revised and correct bill paid and left literally laughing most of the way back to the car Such a shame as they were really nice guys I see they have mixed reviews from other people and some very good but baffled how on this visit Just to add insult to injury something was bleeping every few seconds and by the end was driving me nuts  Smoke alarm needing a new battery maybe 
negative, Can t express how disappointed I was with this place Read a great preview on Leeds list but the whole experience was abysmal 1 Drinks took 20mins to arrive 2 Food took 45 minutes to arrive 3 When it arrived it was appalling If overcooked pasta floating in a milky cheese less soup is what they class as mac and cheese then I give up Tried the fried chicken with waffles   dry chicken overcooked dry waffles Burnt and overly fishy crab cakes   We sent our food back and went somewhere else  This place needs to sort out their entire set up and quickly Confused menu with spelling mistakes poor chefs slow service At this rate it ll be closed within 6 months If the owners are reading this then please consider it a wake up call and turn it around 
negative,We waited over an hour before we rang asking where our delivery was Two hours later still no food and still no answer The phone is either engaged or just keeps ringing  Terrible  
negative, I had lamb chops but they hardly any meat on them It was a very disappointing  Considering Yee Rah is owned by the same people as chaophraya a very nice thai the other side of the grass I was expecting something a bit nicer  I wouldn t recommend 
negative, My wife and I decided to visit here for lunch as she and our son had an excellent lunch about a year ago Having arrived we found a table and I went to get a drink There was one barman who was serving the entire bar as well as taking food orders The place was not very busy but I had to wait 10 minutes to be served while he served two other couples Once served my wife and I chose our lunchtime fare - baked potato for her and a bacon and Brie baguette with cranberry sauce for me Very simple food After twenty more minutes the barman arrived to say that there was no cranberry sauce and did I wish to continue with my order As we had already been there for three quarters of an hour I suspected a change would take for ages and so elected to do without the cranberry About 10 minutes later and over 35 minutes after we had ordered our food it finally arrived  Comment Very poor service from an understaffed pub Barman and waitress were pleasant but no-one should wait nearly an hour for a simple lunch Food when we got it was reasonable quality 
negative, Looked on their website the food looked amazing like a really nice gastro pub How wrong could I be got there and it was nothing like the pictures on the website The chips were under cooked and was pretty much a mess on a plate not like the beautifully presented food on the gallery on the website Should be made to take the pictures off the website So disappointed spent money to stay near by thinking we would be treated to a night of good food The only good thing the waitress was brilliant 
negative, Very busy on the evening we called in without a booking We were seated at the bar area which wasn t a problem at all Decor was good happy with choice to come here initially  We and other couples around us were sat for a very long time without being attended no no one had drinks had to go to bar Only did I get to ask to order when the waitress came to drop my beer off after changing the barrel  Someone kept shouting 900 quite a lot from behind the bar Strange He was the only one there too and seemed pretty peeved I asked him if it was always like this and he said yes but some staff have cried off sick and others stand around doing nothing  Not once did someone attend to the tables in our area One couple walked out after waiting around 45 mins and still had not had their order taken It was as if it was no ones job and the staff did not know they were working in customer service they clearly haven t been trained so  We saw one table where the children were served their food and it wasn t until around 15 mins later the adults were served theirs  I had to go to the bar again as still no staff around then came back and food had finally landed My girlfriends was thrown down in front of her sorry we have non of the hangers left for the hanging chicken kebab  We left Poor poor service in what at first impression looked a nice place The food although we didn t hang around to try it looked insufficient I ordered the short rib which was short on anything other than bone  This place had the ilk of opening night at a TGI Fridays but without the chirpy staff 0 10 
negative,I was lured to the Golden Dragon by its attractive interior design and ordered Stirr Fried Duck with Pickled Ginger and Pinapple No 221  It came fast but was about 35 fat and 35 gristle I tried to chew some meat off two pieces but mainly got blubber Disgusted I sent it back after a few minutes but got charged the full amount When I queried the manager he said that they have served it like that for 15 years and full price applies Here you have a quality guarantee of some sort If you like fat and gristle - go for it 
negative, We ordered the nachos with chilli on top The chilli was disgusting cold and blatenly warmed up out of a tin packet There was minimal mince and was like a brown slop 
negative, Visited today for lunch Only one other person at till and I waited patiently Then two ladies were seen to I waited patiently Then more customers arrived and they were addressed I imediately asked if I was invisible only to be told that the queue was from the other end but when I arrived there had not been a queue and even if I had entered from the correct end I would now be the next in line Needless to say I left I will not be treated that way Staff training is urgently required 
negative, Been here twice now and although the food is very reasonably priced and pretty tasty the rude service has put me off for good Had a pork lo mein and which was fine not the best nor worst I have ever had The staff are surly and practically glare at you Will not be back 
negative, A novelty idea that wears off half way through your bowl of cereal There are other places for snacks on Brick Lane that are a bit more filling affordable and tastier 
negative, Having been here many times when the last managers were in place we decided to give it a look now it s under new management I wish we hadn t bothered The first thing you notice is the Cash only signs on the bar My beer was average at best and when my partner asked for a coffee she might as well have been from Mars from the look she received Once outside the ashtrays we could see were full to overflowing there were empty beer cans and bottles strewn about and the whole place had a whiff of desperation The people running could be seen but not spoken to sitting in the now-defunct restaurant enjoying a drink Absolutely awful 
negative, 1st up I like this pub However on this visit I came in with some colleagues for food after a late running meeting It s burger day so beer & a burger for  X XX We ordered our food together & all got different deals  the bar staff clearly don t know their menu or what they were allowed to sell The manager tonight whilst knowing the products had no clue as to the staff s actions All of our food arrived separately My colleagues had finished their mralx before mine hsd arrived & I had finnished my beer My meal had token salad garnish & no bowl for the chips If I wasn t mega hungry I would have taken it back Didn t receive a check back or would have complained at the time  Finnished our food & have waited over 10 mins to have our table cleared in fact the staff are clearing the food menu s off tables before sorting out empties & dirty plates Sorry not a good experience today Also both gents are out of toilet roll  
negative, Tried this restaurant on spec Terrible decision  The mixed kebab starter arrived 2 minutes after the order was taken Either a lightning fast chef or a microwave in use party of four The chicken tikka looked and tasted like reformed chicken The onion bhaji were very crispy Reheated  The main meals were generous in portion size but lacked any finesse The peshwari naan was raw and the coloured dedicated coconut filling fell out when the naan was ripped open  We left the majority of the meal and made our exit An evening of disturbed sleep being our reward  Perhaps we chose a bad night 
negative, Went to celebrate my wife s exam results  worst meal I have ever had  Ordered and Bing food arrived after 5 mins and claimed it was freshly cooked what a joke  Mash was smash at best and the sausages looked like they were a week old  chicken skewer terrible had 2 pieces of chicken and watery mushrooms  Worst meal I have ever been served and for the price it s a joke  Went to Pizza Hut after and it was 100 times better 
negative, I had just rang to enquire about a table for 10 for the weekend and when I asked if they had space I was greeted with an abrupt NO When I said that was to the point I just got a sarcastic sorry and then they put the phone down Not the way to run a business and if that is customer service I dread to think what the meal would of been like  
negative, I went to this place for my birthday with my 2 children and wife we arrived at 9pm paid the money only to find there was no carvery left when we asked for it we were told it was to late and to get meat off the grill bar sent emails to Customer Service 3 in fact no reply in short there custermer service is as good as Taybarns rubbish keep away or go to a curry house service will be better 
negative, 8 of us went there for new year at first we were seated at a table which we paid a lot for and it was completely bare no xmas decorations we reserved it about a month before and when it came to order they completely forgot we d reserved and said they had lost the reservations book  so we had 2 remember what we d ordered  the starter which took about half an hour to come was terrible carrot and coriander soup it tasted like curry powder and was cold the drinks were late and they were short staffed There was only a couple more people there and yet it took ages and the food tasted dodgy would not recommend used to be good but gone downhill  
negative,The reviews of this small well positioned restaurant could be a gem and splits reviews Following our experience today I am firmly in the avoid camp  The set menu looks tempting and competitively priced however very let down by the service and the quality of the food  Before we even sat down the bread arrived certainly not a precedent for the rest of the service  We chose the fixed menu my starter of tomato and mozzarella - OK but little flavour or dressing my wife prawn and melon - large potion probably half a melon  Then the wait 40 minutes at least for the second course the table next to us arrived ordered ate and departed before it arrived We chased and the waitress did not seem to understand the question Just as we were about to get up and leave after threatening to do this - the veal scallops sic in a lemon sauce arrive for both of us It looked dire the lemon sauce had a skin on it the mashed potato looked somewhat lumpy wet dollop The veal was tuff  Clearly the management knew we were not happy but made no comment as immediately we finished we walked to the till and asked to pay our bill but did they offer apologies or even ask what was wrong - NO  I would strongly advise people not to visit this establishment - it s the worst I have been to ANYWHERE 
negative, I visited Beech Street last week and was very disappointed with the quality of the food for the prices charged  Myself and my boyfriend both had steak which was extremely fatty tasteless and dry The proper chips as they call them were soggy and greasy I also enquired whether the steak came with vegetables and was told there would be a garnish which resembled a weed There were no options on the menu to add any vegetables  I also overheard a conversation with a couple who had booked a table for that evening to be told that there had been an error and their booking had been made for the Monday and there were no tables left 10 minutes later two locals walk in and hadnt booked but were seated and served Very unprofessional 
negative, you know when a pub is struggling when they have to resort to putting bands on a saturday night a night when it should be easy to fill a restaurant 2 for 1 kids eat free free bottle of wine its not rocket science to get your restaurant full get a good chef who cooks food and not opens packets and boxes reasonable prices and dont rip people off for drinks and extras 
negative, Four of us visited for lunch The place wasn t busy however we had to wait 30 minutes for our sandwiches When they arrived they bread was stale and the salad inside old and dried They replaced the sandwiches after another long wait saying they had put the sandwiches under the hot lights New sandwiches came with soft bread but with similar old dried salad in the middle No apologies from the manageress who was there and still charged us the full 33 The Boardwalk Bar & Dining does not do the beautiful setting justice Would certainly not recommend 
negative, After long day in Cornwall we decided to finish with some fish and chips  Unfortunately we regret our decision Spending more than 35 for family of 4 on poor quality food we get the rest of the evening with stomach-ache and sickness 
negative, Apparently this restaurant has recently been taken over and is now being run as a family business This restaurant had a high pedigree for the foodies of Yorkshire & beyond it used to be a flagship consistently winning rave reviews from Cockcroft & Manby in the Yorkshire Post and not just accolades but awards too Run and owned by William it was reknown I frequented it many times hyperbole was not lost on this premier eaterie But it was more than that  a lot more it was an institution a way of life  it was de rigeur Sadly it was then destroyed by someone who shall remain nameless The mass alienation of its customer base followed I could say a lot  but the removal of the Brandy Chocolate Fudge was enough for me So when I noted with relish that it was under new ownership I thought let s try it call for a table so I did to be met with an answer machine  leave a message and we will call you back No they don t call you back So you decide to go down and ask why and you expect a sorry perhaps What you don t expect is  oh we were too busy  to bother the inference being we could not care a less and she was a waitress and owner Clueless and hopeless and totally unprofessional The antithesis of the Drum which is now in the hands of idiots and the arrogance quite unbelievable Jokingly i said well its 9 50 can you give us a table No we have turned everything off and we are too busy anyway What she should have said is listen we couldn t care a less go  A restauranteur of repute would have apologised and said have a drink at the bar Well William would I have lost count of the amount of the times I used to go down to the Drum at ten and catch Williams eye and get a table I go almost misty eyed when I think of how that place was run Now its in the hands of morons and I would never think for a minute of patronising it In any event I would only be disappointed 
negative, Situated in a 1960s office block No attempt made to hide that The 1st floor looks like a floor put in on the cheap Furniture heavily marked and tatty reused menus Film memorabilia poor in quality and behind scratched plastic screens A huge come down from Planet Hollywood of old Now just trading off its name Such a shame Food is okay Avoid 
negative, Booked a table  ordered the sea food platter 24hrs before hand from the huge sign inside the pub When we arrived for the platter there were no clams or oysters as the notice board stated when we asked the waiter where they were he went to the kitchen came back and said or instructed to say we reserve the right to change fish etc on the menu due to seasonal reason so you have extra mussels instead but we don t eat mussels I informed him and in any case they were not on the platter menu if they were we would have had them removed or not ordered the platter Anyway told him we ordered from the sign inside the pub and it certainly didn t say anything there about the restaurant reserve the right to change fish Oh sorry was his reply When the platter arrived a big bowl the tiger Prawns were little more than slightly large shrimps the crab so small and zero imagination on presentation mind you it may have tasted slightly better had they have taken it out of the fridge freezer earlier and has for the half lobster well if that was fresh it must have had a very long slow walk up from the beach it was dry and still frozen in certain parts Asked to see the chief owner again the waiter disappeared came back the chief owner totally refused to come out and it certainly couldn t be because they were busy as there were only 2 other people in the restaurant We were offered a free dessert as compensation me I was prepared only to pay for what I thought the meal was worth but my partner just wanted out of there So my advice if you want good sea food good customer relationship Don t under any circumstance eat at the sea food platter mind you the side salad was edable 
negative,Tried to make a booking was told the restaurant had closed down due to staffing problems Very sad this was the best Chinese in the area 
negative, do not go here - food service surroundings all awful very expensive for very bland food service was terrible - got our food wrong - didn t even offer anything in return - wanted us to tell them what to do - do not go here - its not Italian as it says on the outside 
negative, Three off us had Sunday lunch tasteless roast beef dinner and bland turkey The jus for the beef was like water and the meal was only warm The burger when we last dined there was good but it was tasteless today They served coffee promptly which is possibly why they forgot the puds - which were luke warm just like the service I suppose one could say in a way the service was snooty - who knows why The Manager made recompense and offered everything to make things right 
negative, Nice food nice bar staff but incredibly backward policy regarding children We were told we were only allowed in one small part of the pub and shown a laminated page saying No Children or Animals Beyond This Point  When I complained I was told that they didn t understand why I would bring a child to a pub - pubs are for adults  Wow It s like stepping back in time 
negative, How can you get a simple pasta dish so wrong The pasta was too hard the ingredients seemed cheap ie cheap olives black brine olives and capers and hardly any tuna was included I could this up at home much cheaper and nicer 
negative,Went there with some friends for a drink one evening We were told not advised that we could not sit at the vacant tables unless we were eating Fair enough However we were also told that we could only sit in designated areas if we wanted to drink These designated areas were completely full I asked if we could sit in another area and jobsworth staff reigned  The staff were not only unfriendly they were verging on rude They all seemed to have a personality bypass   no warmth welcome or customer-focus I would never return for a meal in the light of my experience as a drinking customer My friends and I left after one drink and found a more welcoming hostelry  Avoid like the plague sadly  
negative, A complete let down after visiting with family for Sunday Lunch The food was awful cold limp veg and rock hard potatoes Attitude from extremely rude and miserable staff the waitress was so cold and miserable it spoilt the atmosphere The Beef that I had requested medium came out over well done along with a pathetic amount of vegetables After speaking with the Manager he kindly didnt charge us and tried to rectify with a slice of medium beef that was cooked perfectly We were not looking for a free meal just a really nice Sunday lunch  Have to say this place has gone down hill massively We are from the local Village there are much better options out there 
negative, The room was good and food was good Staff treible service was Terible would not stay here again There is no parking on site its 10 minute walk away When i stayed it was full of contractorsand they were short staffed 
negative, Probably one of the worst restaurants in Milton Keynes Awful food  steak that was like rubber dirty menus dirty loos Just terrible  
negative, This restaurant has reasonable reviews on Trip Advisor which lead us to try it before a trip to the Theatre that evening Do not be fooled however this was quite simply one of the worst meals I ve ever had Clearly this is an Italian restaurant being run by people who don t have that Italian passion running through their veins as the bland and tasteless meals don t line up with the usual vibrant Italian cuisine Our Crab and Mango salad was completely covered in Marie Rose sauce ketchup and mayo  and the calamari were rubbery and overcooked obviously frozen Our pasta dishes were covered in greasy cheap cheese and swimming in a watery sauce that resembled more of a veloute Admittedly it wasn t helped by the fact that their Pizza oven was busted but an Italian restaurant needs to be able to serve up decent pasta It may only be a matter of time before Ramsay goes marching in 
negative,Would give zero rating if possible Took a work party there with over a weeks notice so they could prepare and be ready for us took an hour and a half for the first plate to arrive then a massive gap to next courses no bread or olives on offer had to eat a colleagues birthday cake to keep us going while waiting on food Manager clearly not coping and the whole evening was a disaster Just appaling an no words can describe how bad this was 
negative, No Ice no lime cordial no Children s menu and almost no customers Miserable barman no atmosphere no wonder the place was empty on a Sat in July 
negative, I visited the Eastgate restaurant on Saturday night before a trip to the Pictures at The Light the service was ok and starters quite good but a little small and the Riata sauce to accompany them did not arrive until we had nearly finished them The Two main courses both of which were chicken looked like cat food as the chicken was all small pellet shaped and probably reconstituted The curry sauce of the Karahi Chicken was very oily and my partners dish was so bland it was hardly a curry and totally lacked taste The Nan bread was ok but became cold very quickly due to the hanger which it is served on The drinks are quite expensive at 3 25 for a small bottle of Kingfisher I wont be going back  
negative, Surbiton has a good selection of restaurants but unfortunatly Joy is not one of them Over priced for small portions and bad good quality food full of oil and no flavour Tough and chewy mutton which hand t been cooked properly WAIST OF MONEY  
negative, I went in to the drewe arms on January 4th for a couple quite drinks with 7 friends The landlord then came in and said it was time to leave so we started finishing our drinks and taking our empty glasses back  not our job and there was a pint of cider thatchers original which tasted like rats piss When all the empty glass had gone I past the full glass of thatchers back and said it tasted horrible  The landlords response was GET OUT MY PUB I said sorry just letting you know it tastes horrid With in seconds he was around the bar and he grabbed me by the jumper the dragged me out through the bar and littrially threw me ou the door  I went in the bar and apologised for saying it was horrid the next morning and he told me to get out and stay out and he would never want to see me again 
negative, No question the food is good here But the restaurant charged us twice once at reservation once at exit  They promised a fast refund but despite chasing nothing happened for over two weeks Had to get refunded through our bank eventually who then took it up with them Last time we ll go Chef can cook but not great on customer and business management 
negative, Having eaten here several years ago and looking for somewhere different to treat the kids I thought  Damon s I knew it was expensive but what I didn t know was the service and the food are now  POOR And that s being kind We booked the kids were excited all dressed up and off we went Very busy which was nice - as was the smell of cooking Despite checking in 20 minutes early we were forgotten by the staff and consistently overlooked When we reminded them we were waiting we were eventually shown to our table where we were rushed through our ordering eating and paying in less than 30 minutes Not a very special experience The waitress although friendly enough spent all of her time listening to us and watching us so she could pounce immediately we placed our cutlery back on the table I couldn t wait to leave  140 for a pitiful quantity of very average fries and ribs available in Asda for 1 made me realise just what service we get and what value our local Two for One pub is We enjoyed the night in spite of the food and service not because of it We won t be returning My advice  drive down the by-pass to The Pride of Lincoln Have three nights out for the same price Why on earth this place is so popular I do not know 
negative, I went to the Brambles Tea Rooms with my mother as a treat before Xmas It was recommended by a friend of mother The waiteress was very rude could not care less about customer service Asked for something which was on menue but told in a very aggresive manner that it was not available not a problem Chose something else The meat in the steak and ale pie was like rubber very tough to eat chips were very undercooked Pot of tea was like dish water Would certanilly stay away from the establishment 
negative, ~WHY YOU SHOULD NOT VISIT THIS CAFE~ 1 Cheeses are harder than Rossetta Stone 2 Burnt milk in coffee 3 No fresh salads you can see different color tone as changes day by day from green to brownish it s like a chameleon 4 Flies on cakes 5 Food preheated in microwave 6 Uncomfortable chairs and stools if you eat by the window you can feel like a Hobbit 7 Strange meteorites floating in bowls of olives 8 Rude owner doesn t respect employees and customers she is like the exorcist  9 Nasty atmosphere 10 Stressful place 
negative,Having read some of the other reviews on Tripadvisor we must have come across the pub on a bad day - however there was is no excuse for the incompetence of the kitchen  Having been recommended the pub as the place for a Sunday Roast I have never been so let down  Seated quickly we were asked for our drinks and they arrived promptly We reviewed the menu with my knowing that I was going to have the Sunday Roast My girlfriend as a pescatarian had little choice on the menu but settled for stuffed roast pepper - a mistake to soon be realised   Our food arrived within a timely manner however both dishes were minus basic items that were supposed to have been included such as on my dish roast potatoes and yorkshire pudding What is a roast if it does not have those The second dish also arrived with items missing Waiting for the items to be brought to the table we cut into the stuffed pepper only to find it almost frozen solid inside - a basic mistake for even a junior in a kitchen  For the pub supposedly to be the place to eat a roast it leaves a lot to be desired  Have I ever had a worse restaurant experience - NO Will I go back - NOT A CHANCE Pop across the road to the Cricketers who rescued my Sunday Lunch and you will not be disappointed 
negative,Have been here a few times before but not for a year or so It has significantly deteriorated and the staff attitude is very poor 3 were stood about doing little whilst I waited It took a manager of some description to ask the bar staff to serve me I ordered drinks and they are short measures the lager is deliberately frothed up as the last bit is pulled and when I asked for it topped up the barman grumpily added a tiny bit more The coke was the same  1 80 for a half of coke in an over-sized class full of ice Food was then ordered except the order was not recorded properly so one meal did not arrive with the others Puddings ordered later 2 kids and 2 adults and they duly arrived over 5 minutes apart The food was passable but over priced for what it is One to avoid 
negative, We visited Lands End on Tuesday with 3 others and a dog The weather was quite nice during arrival so we decided to eat outside We found a nice area outside of the LE restaurant and decided to order 20 minutes or so after placing our order it began to rain and people moved inside We decided follow suit as there is absolutely no sheltered tables outside the LE restaurant We have a Cocker Spaniel who is well trained and never barks and didn t think there would be a problem with sitting at the table by the door whilst it was raining and we ate our food We had already paid as you have to pay before the meal We placed our dog right in the corner behind our table The waitress saw us and walked off into the kitchen after a few moments she was back with another worker He told us that dogs are not allowed and that we had to take her outside We explained that we ordered when it was not raining and he just kept repeating the same sentence sorry dogs are not allowed  So I asked him what we were supposed to do can we get a refund or are you saying we must eat outside He simply shook his head repeated himself again before walking off with the waitress I couldn t believe how we were being treated and neither could the two gentlemen sat on the table beside us Myself and my girlfriend decided we would eat outside with the dog whilst her mum and brother ate inside 20 minutes later my girlfriends meal arrived to our table outside but there was no sign of my order The rain was gradually getting heavier as I sat watching rain splash into my girlfriends drink She finished her meal and there was still no sign of my LE burger  Just when we thought things couldn t get any worse the waitress who had made us exit the restaurant appeared at the main entrance She didn t have my food but instead shut the double doors on us as we sat on a bench in the pouring rain We couldn t believe it all I could do was laugh as the two men who were sat next to us inside looked toward us with shocked faces This was the final straw and my girlfriends brother and mother went to ask for a refund of my meal only They refused to issue a refund as apparently the meal was on its way it had been 20 minutes since my girlfriend had finished her meal When my meal finally arrived half an hour later I was able to sit inside as the rest of my party had finished so they went outside to seek shelter somewhere with the dog as I ate on my own The food was very average and I wouldn t recommend it to anyone I ve never been treated in such a cruel and unprofessional manner in my life We would have been in and out within half an hour and certainly wouldn t have ordered knowing the weather change and the restaurants anti-dog policy Yet I did notice there is a large paving slab resting near the restaurants entrance which reads  welcome to all our four legged friends My Spaniel certainly didn t feel welcomed A small compromise for our circumstances could have been made but instead we were treated in such a cruel manner Definitely won t be returning in my lifetime 
negative, We went here because of the great reviews The food was tasteless gruel Evidently the people who rated this place have insensitive taste buds and noses or maybe they know no better Or perhaps after 6 pints nobody cares what they eat  Its a nice spit and saw dust pub to hang out with mates but the food sucks I wouldn t take a lady either 
negative, My daughters rave about this place so we decided to give it a try The chicken was so spiced you could not taste the flesh and the chicken livers tasted like they has been dipped in petrol They we inedible Badly cooked food made worse by heavy use of spices and chilis 
negative, Ever since the refurb of the cafe the customer service has gone down the pan Rude waiters and waitresses could hear shouting from the back or kitchen and costs waaayy to much just for a simple tasteless coffee and muffin good views but sadly this is not enough to win back my custom I would rather sit on the dunes with a flask of tea 
negative, Went to eat at the Egerton Arms yesterday evening but unfortunately our trip was very quickly cut short The car park is chargeable 24 hours a day and only takes coins I enquired at the bar if I was either able to get cash back or pay for my parking there but was unfortunately told not Even though the parking charge is refunded on your first order if you don t have the correct change to pay for parking in the first place then don t bother Bar staffs attitude was pretty much that I should have had change in the first place and offered no resolution other than to find somewhere else to eat - We did 
negative, I try not to give negative remarks and for people who have followed my reviews I hope they will see I try to be fair and honest when giving my opinion  so when we went the the new Chiquito s at the kingston centre we did have hopes of a nice evening with good food and good service unfortunately we didnt get as far as the food I am not sure if there was no management on site or any supervisors as we didnt see anyone other than a greeter who was obviously very new and a few waitress s There is not a lot that upsets me but basics like being seated taking an order for drinks and being served would be high on my priority and I would hope a large chain like Chiquito s this would be a basic for them I do understand that when a place opens it takes some time to settle staff and when we visited it 4 weeks earlier the service wasnt perfect but i told the duty manager and she put it right straight away the food was good and we had a pleasant family evening I also understand that on a Monday evening and it was packed you have to move your expectations this Monday there was barely a quarter full the girl behind the bar was gazing out the window and i could see half of my drink order on the bar yet after sitting for more than 20 minutes the party on the table next to us who came in 10 minutes after us and was enjoying there drinks i called it a night No one to complain to no one other that our waitress who looked shocked when i said we were leaving as we didn t want to wait any longer We went to wagamamas and had an excellent meal I don t expect to be returning to chiquitos again 
negative,I ve never written a review about a restaurant ever I m not a food critic I m a normal diner but I felt compelled to write something about my experience tonight  My wife and I along with our 2 young children decided to treat ourselves to a meal out on a Sunday evening We had seen this new Chiquito along with a few others over at Kingston and decided to go there  I had perhaps slightly higher hopes than normal as the place has been open a while now and being fairly new you d think that they were going to impress How wrong I was  Upon entering the place it looked very good Clearly the designers know what to do However we stood at the front desk for about 10 minutes with members of staff clearly making eye contact with me Eventually a young girl approached the desk but was looking for something my wife asked if we could have a table for 4 with 2 high chairs and she looked perplexed She didn t even say hello or welcome to Chiquito or any kind of greeting My first thought was she clearly was in the middle of something and was hoping someone else would man the front of house After standing there and staring into the restaurant for about a minute she just mumbled and walked towards what we assumed was our table We followed and she went to get 2 high chairs leaving us standing at our table while others around were eating I might be wrong but if it was me I would have told the people to wait at the desk and prepare a table for the customer  She gave us the high chairs and mumbled something I couldn t help but think   « She didn t like working there  « She had been out all night drinking with little or no sleep the night before  « It was near the end of her shift and she was thinking about home  « Chiquito staff training at this restaurant is rubbish  « All of the above  I later saw her with her coat on chatting with someone at the tills and then she left so she must have been at the end of her shift  So after she mumbled she didn t offer us a drink or any children s packs for the 2 small children we had with us  About 30 seconds after she left a polite waitress brought some popcorn in a dish which was actually very nice and was a good distraction for the children She then took our drinks order of a Pepsi diet Pepsi and water  A few minutes later a young lad brought over 2 drinks the Pepsi and the water We asked where the diet Pepsi was and the guy said he d go and check He never came back nor did our drink ever arrive  After seeing a good 10 or more staff walking past us we decided to stop someone and ask if we can order our food as nobody seemed to see us with our menus shut for 10 minutes which I thought was international code for I want food now   The guy took our order on his computer complaining it was very slow this is a shock as you would think a new restaurant would have a decent IT infrastructure  After taking our order he left On a positive note the food arrived quickly from someone who seemed to be the manager as he wasn t wearing the usual uniform He put the food down for the kids but kindly mentioned that our table was quite small and was worried that the sizzling dish I had ordered could result in one of the kids burning themselves He immediately suggested a much bigger table and started to move our food with the help of the polite waitress This was the single positive thing from the whole experience  So once we sat on our new table which we suddenly realised was so much better than the tiny table we originally sat on which the original young girl should have realised we began to eat our food  The children s food was nice and basic which is what you want to a 1 and 2 year old My wife s burger was very nice she said however my fajita dish wasn t really that great I ordered chicken and BBQ pulled pork the dish arrived with the chicken and pork on top of a hot plate covered in onions and peppers The meat had clearly not been cooked with the onions and peppers and tasted extremely bland It actually tasted like the char grill was only used to warm it up rather than cook it from scratch  So I then looked at my fajita kit with all the sauces etc There were no spoons or serving implements for the sour cream guacamole or salsa Which I have seen in other places I opened my little packet of wraps which all ripped apart and were stuck to the wrapping it came in This meant my wraps had holes in them and became very messy to eat The only real taste was not the meat but actually the sauces which were nice but then I can buy them from a supermarket Nobody came to check on us to see if our food was ok so we decided to eat up and get ready to go Had I wanted to get someone s attention I doubt I would have had new wraps in time before my food went cold  We asked for the bill and paid up just over 40 00 I think what hurts the most is the fact that I could have bought everything from a supermarket kits and jars included for half the price and had 10 times the service at home I understand new restaurants have teething issues and young staff on low wages are not going to set the world on fire with customer service but this place had made me write a review for the first time I would actually get a better service in McDonalds  Whoever is running this restaurant needs to pay attention to staff training and watch what they are doing as some real basics have been missed If I find myself complaining on here and bear in mind this is the first time ever for me then other people will clearly be spreading negative comments around Milton Keynes  Chiquito you need to have a word 
negative, Me and a few friends decided to take on the 12 best beers in Liverpool pub crawl on the 14th March This pub came up on the list and was our 4th stop following a couple of fun experiences in other places most notibly the Dovey on Penny Lane For a moment I would like to just give a shout out to that place The barkeeper found out it was my birthday and gave me a jaegerbomb but instead of jaeger put sambuca in and instead of red bull put jager in Lovely start to a long day  Back to the Baltic Fleet I would love to take time to say the beer was decent and so was the pub but the manager was one of the worst people I have ever met in a customer service role so I will focus on him I mean COME ON It isn t hard we were in there at about 1pm hardly like it was rammed He still couldn t manage it  To begin with  10 of us were doing the pub crawl Still quite sober only pub 4  so there was not yet any roudiness We entered the pub ordered drinks at the bar and stood around by it The bar was quite long so plenty of room for people to get served and we were nt in anyone s way Then Captain Crummy came over and advised us that we weren t allowed to stand in the room where we were and to go find seats in the back So we did  We found nice seats and were happy Then Larry Letdown came back in after noticing we were having fun and enjoying our pints He must not be an advocate of this as it was the second time in about 10 minutes he decided to butt in We were told we could not sit where we were because it was in the way In the way of what his ego When we protested he was having none of it So we moved then when we did they moved all of the tables and chairs we were sat on so they pretty much piled on top of each other What a waste of seating basically just cleared them out of the way for a laugh  Following that the only place we could go that wasn t sitting down or near the bar was by some doors Which as expected we were constantly reminded to remain out of the way of for the 3 people that during out stay wanted to get past  Also worth mentioining the toilets were a horrible mess Maybe this is why the manager was in such a bad mood because he was just thinking about having to go up there and clean them which to be fair I wouldn t want to do  Beer was fine and prices were too All other staff = fine and dandy 
negative,We were visiting Tunbridge Wells for the afternoon with our daughter who is at Brighton University and we do not live in the UK I called in to this hotel as we wanted to treat her to a meal I enquired in the restaurant if it was open to non-residents and if I could look at a menu A very grim looking young lady who was not English seemed annoyed that I had asked to see the menu The foyer and restaurant were so dimly lit that I could not read it However I did notice that it would be quite expensive to eat there As other reviews have stated the tables were very close together and as the young ladies manner had been so unwelcoming and offputting I chose not eat there The owners need to do some in-house customer service training 
negative, We booked a table for six at the monthly Bistro evening to celebrate two of the parties 60th birthdays We were given a time of 7 45 and arrived 5 minutes early We were not advised there were any problems We received the starter an hour and a half later at 9 15 and were just getting up to leave when the main course was served at 9 50 Both courses were lukewarm and only just OK for quality The menu here is a three course set meal but we didn t bother with dessert As we left we were told some staff hadn t turned in had we been told on arrival it would have been our decision to stay or go All in all one to forget If you re thinking of coming here I would certainly give it a miss unless you re prepared to watch your life ebbing away whilst you wait 
negative,Including today s visit I ve been to Tenji four times And today s visit has been the absolute worst of the lot which has convinced me to seriously think twice about revisiting again  We reached in the afternoon - a little after 1pm expecting a spread like the previous times we ve been before  First off - no sashimi at all None When asked about it the waiter spiky-haired with a permanent frown on his face looking like the whole world owes him a living nonchalantly said they were out of stock  which was flat-out ridiculous A japanese buffet restaurant running out of sashimi Come on you can do better than that Only after being questioned multiple times by frustrated patrons did they bring out rather reluctantly a platter of salmon nigiri If you re gonna cut down your budget and exclude sashimi in the afternoon kindly put a disclaimer on your website saying telling prospective patrons there s none in the afternoon because not doing that is false advertising plain and simple People making their way down expecting some of that stuff are going to be sorely disappointed worse off being told by some impatient unruly waiter that it s out of stock is ludicrous  Secondly the sushi counter took ages to refill despite having been cleaned out for a good half and hour or so Even if business is slow in the afternoon aren t your customers paying the same price for their meal  Thirdly notwithstanding the fact that their Haagen Dazs Ice cream as proudly advertised on their website is some alternative brand that none of us have heard of before Buckleberry if memory serves  they stockpiled the entire freezer with the lousiest flavours available Liquorice & Blackcurrant and Raspberry which everyone knows are the least popular ones None of the usuals like chocolate strawberry and even the most flavour of vanilla was available among the rows and rows of ice cream in the freezer Yet another case of we-don t-really-care-cos-it s-a-weekday-afternoon-and-there s-only-ten-odd-of-you-around-and-it-aint-worth-my-while  The first time I m writing such a scathing review on a place I thought I actually liked but I ve tried to keep objective as best as I can All in all poor variety and an absolute lack of effort coupled with poor service from a particular male waiter Definitely no longer what it used to be and I suggest you think twice about making your way down 
negative, Eaten here before and love it   visited Sunday night for my sons 18th Birthday and turned into Fawlty Towers   after starters 3 out of our 4 mains appeared   one we had to wait on as not cheffy enough but no salad and all 4 fries came out  3 of which were wrong  they got took back and we waited Upto 5 minutes for them to return but fortunately we could sit and watch our steaks and baby chicken all go cold   manager come over to apologise in such a condescending way he would of been better off not coming over at all   after all what is wrong with cold food in a posh restaurant  Anyway the not cheffy enough dish came out in time for the new fries so daughter had a hot meal while we all got to have piping hot fries with cold steak and cold chicken Fortunately the salad and ketchup arrived for the end of our meals   Have complained and been offered a free complimentary meal which I politely turned down as we won t be going back So an honest review to help and guide people s choices     other businesses wouldn t get away with that service   oh it wasn t a full restaurant so that s not the excuse  
negative, I was unable to attend a party of 12 and my associates had to pay full price for my non attendance which I have refunded to them I have never experienced this anywhere before and advise you to consider the thinking behind this establishment before visiting 
negative,We visited here in August and was disappointed but we put it down to the wedding reception that was going on Our friends were running 10 minutes late asked if we would like a drink we said we would wait till our friends arrived I watched the lady who seemed to be in charge of the restaurant send 3 different people over to us to ask us if we would like a drink  NO didn t seem to be in their vocabulary Our friends ordered the ham & eggs and at 14 00 I didn t think it was worth 1 2 that price I had a small beer battered fish & chips @ 8 50 I couldn t taste any beer in the batter the peas & tartar sauce came in quite large ramekins all in a soup dish leaving little room for the fish & chips in fact the fish which was a little smaller than a 5 note had to be put on top of about a dozen chips The menu s are just A4 pieces of paper no sleeves or covering on them no effort made at all to make them look presentable and when they advertise rat & warthog it puts you off ordering anything at all I think this will be my last visit 
negative, I used the Just Eat online ordering system to get a couple of pizzas from this place after seeing good reviews on this site Sadly when my order was over an hour late I called to see what was going on and was received by a very unpleasant guy who said that the delivery driver had sat outside my flat for ten minutes yeah helps if you press the bell I subsequently re-ordered only to find that the place was now shut and I cannot cancel the new order which will be arriving tonight at half five when I no longer want it not to mention that I m now 17 out of pocket because of the un-delivered order Avoid this place at all costs 
negative, Visited a Friday evening with 10 work friends waited over an hour for the main course people didn t get there naans until nearly the end Felt terrible the next day have doubts the lamb was cooked properly Many other curry houses in the area never again  
negative, Appaling food Pie delivered with BURNED inside contents and like a manhole cover Ages taken to serve Pie microwaved into something inedible with the qualities of concrete in terms of attempted opening with cutlery Awful experience Will never go there again Warning learn from my ghastly experience at the Pickerel 
negative, this is a hard review to write there are some good points but the feedback is such as they need to get their act together otherwise they will loose all credibility Quality control is the nature of my work and in my blood I aim to be constructive  First point to make is that the customer is always right they are the ones paying your wages rent profit and without them you are nothing  Secondly you have a web presence it would be useful if we could find the physical location you may joke that you are remote and hard to find but after driving around took two hours a brilliant way of getting the customer hot under the collar by the way the drive back only took 25 minutes go figure room for improvement postcode is not enough on many satnavs so need street name and or gps co-ordinates we should not have to rely on google maps to find you especially when there is no phone coverage  On arrival we were greeted by stressed out staff you can t be at your best in these circumstances it doesn t matter what the root cause was it is definitely not the potential customers problem not in their power nor inclination to resolve issues unless it was advertised as some team building activity  As for food we were told there would be a 45 minute wait in a manner that put me off which from calculation of other request to delivery times proved to be greatly in excess of this and I was glad I didn t order  Menu wise there was too much emphasis on posh nosh does the chef have an ego greater than their talents this I can not comment on  Good food needs to be what the customer wants remember we tend to be in groups with a verity of tastes needs to look good but we can not taste it if it takes too long to be delivered  Personally I was looking forward to have something from the menu but others were hoping for something less glamorous  So in conclusion from the observations and comments made on the night this could have been better planned with the staff asking the right questions when they knew of the event which to my knowledge was requested about two or three months ago an indication of numbers could have been obtained and resources arranged so from what would have been an enjoyable evening with friends    wasn t   I am giving feedback as I want small businesses to succeed there are too many tasteless chains Please do better others will read this and look for the improvements mentioned in my suggestions  My views are though the eyes of an observant customer 
negative, After 40 plus years of eating at Curry Houses all over the UK we decided through laziness to try this one which was effectively on our doorstep  One reviewer enthisastically stated that it was the best restaurant this side of the Ganges and had used it exclusively for 15 years He must have been a heavy smoker or constantly had flue to find this garbage acceptable  This same guy has obviously never tried anywhere else  as Bowburn Tandoori Centre takes bland food and tardy service to an entirely new level SPECTACULARLY AVERAGE  Waiting an hour to have this junk prepared was not a good experience  If you are local get in your car and drive to South Shields where any of the Restaurants will provide a sit down 3 course meal for around 7 per head and it will be delicious owing to the competition on Ocean Road  I am not a professional complainer but if you are looking for a tasty spicy meal why not buy a Pot Noodle as undoubtedly it can not be worse than this  RUBBISH         
negative, Visited The Bear last week as a group of 4 for lunch We were told there were no tables available and there would be a 20 minute wait which initially we were ok about However on looking in the restaurant there were several empty tables that hadn t been cleaned and reset When we pointed this out to the young man who appeared to be in charge he immediately went over and cleaned a table and reset it for us to use The food was average for pub food but the place seemed to be understaffed and chaotic with several tables left uncleaned throughout our time there The standards of this once beautiful pub and restaurant have dropped greatly over the years and it now one of a chain serving average food with poor service and general hygiene standards Will not be returning 
negative, This restaurant is in a great spot on the river with good views and a lively atmosphere but that s where the pleasure ends The food is dodgy thai and one that I wouldn t recommend Overpriced and no seamless flavours coming through on the small portions 
negative, The four of us captured within terminal 5 had not eaten since 0500 hrs Lunch time Huxley s was the only appealing menu within the many other places but the truth is there was NO queue Seated pleasant enough and ordered  Orders came immediately saw oven chips  a toasted bun burger and nothing else  The waiter ran away   called him back stated  where is the cheese and bacon  Oh did you order it Ran off again to check  I must have been lying My sons was the same After he had checked he asked did we still want the cheese and bacon I give you a guess as to what I said  Well it did come  cooked upon a saucer If we had not been hungry we should have walked out  But being within a security controlled environment did not wish to miss the plane  14 for the very average dish was total rip off Its terminal for us meaning we will never go back  Biggest tip of all time  avoid and take sarnies  terminal 5 is also terrible  
negative, Many years ago I lived in North Devon One day we visited a steak restaurant in Barnstaple High Street The food was nothing short of appalling The reason given when we summoned the waitress was that the Chef hadn t turned up so the staff were having a go  That may or may not be the reason for the horrendous meal I had at the Indian Paradise restaurant in Boscombe Bournemouth - a misnomer if ever there was one However I think that congratulations are in order here It really takes some effort to be that bad  The outside of the restaurant is pretty shabby but that doesn t always mean a bad meal The welcome was good but the restaurant was empty never a good sign However we soldiered on The decor is really really tired and the whole place needs refurbishing  The menu was pretty standard and orders were placed The food that appeared though bore no resemblance to any dish of its kind I have eaten anywhere in the world The Chicken Tikka Jalfrezi was almost entirely devoid of tomatoes or colour and looked dull and uninviting The Lamb Jalfrezi was - apart from looking like a limpid Korma - almost entirely devoid of lamb And flavour The bowl that was supposed to contain Matar Paneer contained something not entirely dissimilar to dog vomit Indeed it tasted as rank as I imagine dog vomit would actually taste The explanation for this was that they make their own Paneer cheese in house My advice Don t  Why on earth do they bother They are two doors away from a much better restaurant sadly closed on the night we visited and there is simply no comparison If you are in competition guys you need to up your game substantially To be honest you re probably better off giving up entirely  Truly this was one of the worst meals I have ever eaten and am still paying for it as I write this some 18 hours later In their favour they removed the Matar Paneer from the bill but my recommendation is that you steer clear of this restaurant unless they refurbish and get a new Chef  Oh no Here we go again  
negative, Poor range of pretentious dinner offering at London prices and not worth the money poor service from untrained staff and aren t I the best attitude from owner no personality at all This could be a gem in new ownership with someone who has customer skills and the right attttude Visited for lunch once just OK apart from the prices but dinner was a business embarassment poor choice of food and dreadful service would not go back awful all round 
negative, Visited this place with clients in August Service was very unfriendly and food was served on dirty plates The coffee cups were likewise stained one with lipstick 
negative, we decided that we would go into morecambe for a drink and a meal i went to the bar as my other half wanted a lager but was told lager off they had run out of gas so had to buy an overpriced warm budwieser i asked for a green king ipa from the pump which tasted so foul it was undrinkable we decided that if was bar servive heaven help what the meal would be so we left in disgust if this is the standard of this place then its no wonder morecambe getting a bad name 
negative, You may want to take this review with a pinch of salt as I should have wrote it closer to the time I went with work colleagues for the Christmas team meal last december Out of approx 16 -20 of us I think only half enjoyed the food I personally thought the food was awful I had veal for my main and it was one of the worst things I ve ever ate I will never go back 
negative,Food not up to much hardly no meat in the spagetti Bolognese Chicken on the pizza really dry almost inedible The service was even worse English spoken poorly the waiter was rude and arrogant and bad at his job and will not be back ever 
negative, I went to Fresh Basil for lunch with my boyfriend The place was full so we had to walk around the town and wait which wasn t a problem My boyfriend always has the breakfast which is usually good This time I decided to try the prawn Caesar salad which turned out to be NOTHING like a salad - small poor quality prawns TWO small pieces of lettuce a bunch of tomatoes some olives wrapped with anchovies and bread All skimpily served individually on a wooden board making it unpleasant to eat Overall the only part I enjoyed was the bread with butter I was surprised to see that my boyfriend got more lettuce as a garnish with his breakfast than there was in my salad   Stuff should also consider cleaning more Even if the food would have been nice it s impossible to enjoy a meal with dirty tables and sticky cutlery  The coffee is also poor 
negative,Noisy busy but chaotic banging doors untidy smelly loos poor service unexperienced silly staff No leadership Food OK once it arrived  Table booked for 6pm - as soon we arrived told we had to vacate by 7 15 Sat next to doors to loos - bangs loudly everytime someone goes through Ordered at 6 15 latest - food arrived 6 55  Table of 9 food arrived within 20 mins Ladies filthy smelled of urine hadn t been cleaned or tidied since lunchtime Unacceptable Will upload awful photos I took of the state of the loos if I still get no reply to my email 
negative, One of the most impressive buildings I have ever visited spoilt by such a rubbish pub Chimneys need to be sorted out you could see the smoke from the open fires in the main rooms Cheap wood veranda erected outside with screw ends showing Please donate the building to someone who knows what they are doing and provide a pub with some atmosphere 
negative, we stopped here after driving from Italy we ordered two beers and two steaks the beers arrived promptly  although they weren t busy the food still hadn t arrived after 45 mins the waitress came and apologised they hadn t started with our order  we could see the kitchen staff who just seemed to be larking around with nothing to do we watched them for another 10 mins after one started picking his nose we had had enough paid for our beers and left wit no explanation as to why this had happened 
negative,We bought a take away one Saturday night and the food was absolutely terrible with chicken of various colours when cut open Clearly some looked fresh and other somewhat out of eat by date in our opinion We do know our curries and have travelled and eaten it in Indian on numerous occasions Don t risk eating food from this place we d never do so again 
negative, If you are a family with children then notenthis resturant doesnt allow children after 7pm Or so they say as we were spoken to about this whikt other tables were not Steer clear unless you are a local 
negative, Had table booked for group of 15 people for my birthday for 7pm week before due to go told had to be out by 8 30pm  Which if their service is as slow as reviews say would have been mad rush Too late to find replacement venue so thanks 
negative,Nothing to like about a place like this Treat staff like dirt What do I like about the place  Close it down thats good 
negative,Honestly seriously really i never ever thought i would wright a review on trip advisor but now i see what all the fuss is about sometimes you need to share your experiences good and bad im just disappointed in myself that the first thing that could drive me over the edge was bad But very bad very very bad the atmosphere in the pub was nice the decor is good cosy but not cluttered plus one star unfortunately this is where it ended i used to frequent the restaurant regularly during the past year since it reopened to begin with it was fantastic and i should have written a 4 star review at the time the barbecues the outdoor paellas were truly a breath of fresh air in a stale standardized restaurant environment and for this i salute you  again im sorry i did not review this disappointed in myself  however in the last 4 months are so its gotten worse floor staff the same and all ok maybe a little more stressed than usual but what do you expect at the festive period i get it but the food the food  i have been 4 times in the last 4 months and each time it has been progressively worse i can only assume that what was an enthusiastic Chef in the reopening at the Pullman has since lost the will to live and their cooking has deteriorated alongside this  the burgers for instance were phenomenal in the past full of flavor just cooked pink to perfection as i always ask it to be now i ask for pink i am greeted with a short sharp NO it cant be done    i dont argue maybe the food inspectors did not like it   at lest those familiar burgers will still be packed with all that flavor wrong again bland dry and a little sour i can now assume that the burger can no longer be cooked pink as the meat is no longer as fresh as it used to be  The fish  that too used to be a pleasure the specials board was a wash with such variety now your lucky to get one special a week for the record the fish and chips that s already on your menu is not also a special im so so sorry i never reviewed you when you where good Pullman but please get good again and i swear to god i will wright back in see you next month 
negative, Arrived and greeted by surly owner Although a couple we ordered enough food for 4 as we wanted to try it all We had to have a sandwich when we got home - that s how small the portions are Annoyed that although not licenced they still charge corkage for drinks we bring Green curry with chicken was mostly cauliflower and the chicken would comfortably fit in a tablespoon Added to the fact that we were repeatedly ignored by the waiter whilst he was overly friendly to other tables and the bill was the most we ve ever paid for a Thai meal and we won t be going back I could go on and on I m so annoyed Avoid at all costs 
negative, Food good but the drivers dictate their customers had to meals delivered and very pleased but on trying to order for special occasion for Mothers Day was told they were happy to take the order but the drivers felt we were to far away to deliver Who runs the company the restaurant or the drivers Would be a good takeaway if it wasn t unreliable 
negative,Very disappointing over all I ordered mussels and waited about 20mins to be told the mussels wasn t good by a member of management ordered mushrooms thay came without any bread  Then had the gammon witch was ok but half our party had there main coarse about 10mins be fore if came the the bill came and there was a how har over that very disappointing will not be returning to this pub ever
negative,The staff are ignorant and rude a real couldn t be bothered attitude waiting for chips to cook not that they would tell you that they just stand around sulking and scratching Pretty poor so far but not as poor as the produce - chips were stale tasting and dry yesterday s  Sausage as I see someone else has said earlier tasted funny Chucked the lot in the bin  Pick up or pack up you are a embarrassment to Shrewsbury jow you are still in business is a real mystery Oh and clean the shop before you leave it s filthy and smells as such 
negative, My friend and myself decided to lunch in victoria circus wimpy bar what a mistake the service was slow and when the bill arrived they had charged 40p for a coffee shot we hadnt had when we queried the bill the manager said it was because we asked for 2 teabags Unbelievable 
negative, My wife and i were visiting friends in the local area and we all decided to go out for dinner We all had pizza and frankly it was not even of the poor quality you get from a budget 79 pence pizza you get from a supermarket How you actually make a vile pizza i do not know but they managed it Poor service and the toilets were filthy I feel if they cannot be bothered to clean the toilets then i hate to think what state the kitchen is in I would rather go hungry than eat there again 
negative, It was my birthday and 11 friends were celebrating with me I have been to Viva many times and as far as i am aware I have never paid an optional service charge On this occasion there was one added to the bill 10 of the 505 bill Because I was not told of the service charge I paid the bill and tipped the staff an 35 extra  What made it worse is they did not serve all the meats and my friends who had never been felt disappointed Food was OK and staff were friendly but the hidden service charge was dishonest and deceitful  When I called to complain Viva management didn t call me back 
negative, I went to this place last Monday with friends the food I received was cold and the eggs looked like rubber  To top it off you could hear one older woman quite short with glasses from the kitchen in particular with vile language towards members of her own team if this is how staff are treated on a regular basis I can t say I m surprised the food came out disgusting I wouldn t want to work with that either 
negative, we visited the millers arms on Saturday 8th November at 6pm my first reaction was how cold the dinning area was the food we had was also cold the gammon steak my friend had did not have the 3 4 of a inch rind cut of the steaks my wife and friend had were tough and the food service was shocking we were all going to have a sweet but the waitress was nowhere to be found I had to walk through to the bar to get my bill I even to tell the chef that we were going and the bill and the money was left on the table again we could not find the waitress we will not be back 
negative, Waited a long time to be served and the people behind us arrived after us and we re served before us When I pointed this out to the waitress she was quite rude The food was expensive and nothing special Won t use again 
negative, We visited Perios after seeing the owner on Dragons Den We found the menu to be very limited with not enough choice I decided to have a burger which i didn t think tasted very good Certainly won t be visiting again 
negative, Although the food is ok it is far too expensive The portions are tiny and cost about 10 each and you need to order at least 3 or 4 per person You end up paying a lot of money for rather simple food and a lot of bread with olive oil The place would be ok if prices were half of what it costs now and the sizes double 
negative, Upon entering Mayas the restaurant interior looked impressive compared with other buffets such as East and Aroma After being seated and ordering our drinks me and my partner went and got our first plate of food  I myself went to the sushi and after eating the first piece was unpleasantly surprised with the lack of flavour However as it was the first dish I decided to soldier on and try the Mexican stand After creating my beef burrito I returned to the table and took a large bite into the wrap only to find a large unexpected crunch that couldn t have been the onions Spitting out the mouthful I was greeted with a large lump of bone and gristle that had found its way into my dinner This wasn t just a little bit of bone either this thing was about the size of my knuckle it was large and solid enough to cause damage to a tooth i consider myself luck  After being put off of the mexican food we decide to try something different and went for the Crispy Duck  Never have I eaten duck with the consistency of what I imagine bathroom sealant to collate too This wasn t just me being picky and I understand that they need to serve a large quantity of people but that is no excuse to use low grade poor quality meats from god knows what animal  It wasn t just the lack of flavour and quality either but also the little things that all add up such as walking past the buffet counter and getting a glimpse of a large bucket of what looked like chicken just sitting there The spoons not being able to fit into the dessert glasses and the ice cream machine advertising frozen yogurt that unsurprisingly by this point was in fact ice cream  The staff were hardly in sight the whole time and after bitting into my low grade meat burrito I was desperate for something to wash down the gristle taste left in my mouth This led me to have to wave an arm at a waitress Then when it came to the bill we had already paid with groupon costing 15 between us The drinks bill came over which to our surprise was 14 43 which didn t add up Reading through the bill there was an added charge of 2 90 After the meal I had just experienced I was in know way prepared to be milked out of as much money as the owners could grab After contesting the added miscellaneous charge apparently you have to pay in order to use a coupon which in all of the groupon meals I have attended have never been required to pay for something I have already paid for  To summarise I would have rather gone to a fast food chain than have to endure Mayas again The food was of the lowest quality the service was of the lowest quality and overall this has gained its place as the worst restaurant I have eaten in Stick to East and Aroma whilst avoiding this place like the Plague 
negative, Arrived 8 15pm approx Large crowd of people in foyer with dogs drinking and very raucous Drinks order taken but did nt arrive until 20 minutes later after two reminders Food order taken prior to this but nothing arrived untll 9 45pm after being told the kitchen had lost the original order Should have walked at this point but felt sorry for young man doing his best and everything on his own Food arrived but was very medicore my battered fish was served upside down on a pile of very pallid chips Free coffees did not fully compensate for the disappointment 
negative, ive been to this restaurant many times in the past and i has always been nice food and service but the last few times it has steadily got worse I was early to meet my friend so thought i would go in and have a drink at the bar seated area i asked a waitress if that was ok and she said not really  then she asked if i was eating there and i explained that i was waiting for a friend and we would be eating with a pained expression on her face shesaid i suppose so but you will have to wait  there was no niceness about her manner and ten minutes later a glass of wine was plonked in front of me My friend turned up and we were seated by another waiter who was equally unfriendly and waited ten minutes for someone to take our drink order All through the meal we felt like we were being ignored andthe restaurant wasnt busy so it wasnt cause they didnt have enough staff etc The house wine was like vinegar and we paid the bill and on our way out we were stopped by a waiter who said that we had paid too little and they had got the bill wrong and we owed ten pound more the waiters had been huddled together and we felt like we were being talked about and felt uncomfortable in front of the other diners I have worked in restaurants for years and only write things like this when i feel the service has been particularily bad Its such a shame because its a beautiful restaurant and the food has always been nice but i wont be returning 
negative,Everything was awful never will I return  No one seems to know what they are doing the food was god awful the chefs need a good lesson in cooking and managers need to pull their weight
negative,Not what we have come to expect from Harry Ramsdens it used to be big chunky chips with lovely battered fish and cooked to perfection Recent trip to Bournemouth with the expectation of a great meal to finish the day What a big disappointment skinny frozen chips and soggy batter and poor quality fish So have they franchised it off not Ramsdens fare at all WILL NOT BE RETURNING
negative, Ripped off just been to Food Court in Saltaire and charged restaurant prices instead of what is advertised on their website Argued with manager who refused to honour advertised prices even when confronted with website on iPhone Beware check your bills 
negative, Saltiest food I have ever eaten Waiters spoke to us as if we were doing them a favour in being there and we certainly will not return 
negative, Having been told by several people that this is the best fish and chip shop in Wokingham I gave it a try First time closed for holiday and the same a few months later On both those occasions went to the chip shop in barrett crescent which was very good and they do rock salmon which is not always available now days and it was extremely good Finally went here and they were open last week Terrible chips all dry with no golden colour soggy with no crisp and the centres just pappy potato Miserable staff just probably filling in time tile their next holiday Barrett crescent for me The Queens head on the terrace does the best fish and chips in Wokingham as a charity night from time to time shame it is not a regular thing but what a treat when it is on 
negative,Got there and managed to get seated but was told table was reserved for later in the evening decided to have the carvery but the service was very slow and whilst I was waiting heard them say to a lady all the burgers had gone and only beef left on the Carvery When it was my turn the guy informed me there was only four portions of Beef left which we had two and looking at it being carved it was very fatty When trying to eat it  it wasn t fit to feed the dog so it was left on side of plate with this I asked to see the Manager and he explained they d been having trouble with the Beef supplied of late I asked for a refund which was given and I can honestly say the meal was Sh-t 
negative, nothing good to say about this pub the staff turnover is high the quality of staff and food is low cleanliness is slow to bad 
negative, It is 3 times now that we have eaten at the tree cups would we eat there again no Why would that be on Sunday 17th May I took my wife there for Lunch we had Roast Pork with Yorkshire pudding the plates arrived COLD the GRAVY WAS ALSO COLD This went back to the kitchen when it arrived the GRAVY WAS STILL NOT WARM AND THE PLATES WERE COLD THE YORKSHIRE PUDDING WAS RAW INSIDE ROAST POTATOES WERE HARD AND SO WERE THE VEGTABLES THESE WERE NOT COOKED  When it came to pay there was no reduction in the cost for a meal which we considered over priced   did we have a pudding not likely   For a basic Sunday Roast Dinner STAY AT HOME do not go to the Three cups at Stockbridge Hampshire 
negative, After being recommended for the past three or four years ago from my two Sub-Continent friends telling me - for the price - this was the best Indian in town  I had been looking forward to this experience for years   The three main things which left me feeling disappointed are the following  1 Once seated the service was extremely poor I almost felt as if I was bothering the waiters whilst ordering my food  2 The glasses on the table were dirty old oil marks when you don t wash the dishes with hot water  3 On every table there were a couple small bowels of sauces mango chutney  uncovered and not changed from customer to customer certainly whilst we were there so would be surprised if it left on table the whole day AT LEAST  This is not what would be regarded as standard hygienic practice Other than that the food was tasty and well priced If they could sort these three things this place would be a gem 
negative, Unfortunately we decided to have lunch here together with friends colleagues today We have been waiting 20 minutes to get our orders and 50 more minutes for the food Pricey meal for what we got badly cooked and poorly presented 13 spent on any fast food meal would have been a big win compared to this Negative note an English pub without burgers on the menu Positive note we got the service out of the bill  Three words never ever again 
negative,I came to the hotel for a work related meeting in the evening we all met up in the bar area I stood at the bar trying to buy a drink for about 15 minutes while people all around me were arriving at the bar and being served while I was ignored I eventually gave up and went into my meeting thirsty  I couldn t comment on the rest of the facilities but if they re anything like the bar I d give it a miss 
negative, Called at the Cafe during a long coast walk The cafe was due to close at 17 00 but refused any food or drinks at 16 45 as The till had been cashed up  Disgusting service as the cafe was quite full of customers wanting to buy food and drink and there was still 15 minutes to closing time I will never go then again 
negative, Went to Strada looking for a nice meal but got the opposite three of us had different meals two were passable but the third was  well tasted and looked like it had been made by a 5 year old it was disgusting supposed to be canaloni  it was all munched up and the tomato sauce was a tin of tomatoes thrown over the top as you can imagine it went back the new one wasn t any better with less of the same so called sauce  it had been made cold and and reheated back up under the grill when it arrived we couldn t believe what we were seeing first the dish was red hot and the tomato juice had splattered all over the plate and was cold in the middle it was returned after speaking with manager it was taken off the bill so my friend had nothing to eat even worse is that this place is not disabled friendly in fact it is breaking all disability laws the disabled person has to go outside the restaurant to get into a lift which is too small for a wheelchair and when they reach the top they have to get guest s to move tables a chairs to be able to pass to get to the disable toilet which is locked if the person using the toilet didn t have a radar key the they would have to go back down stairs for the key shocking when we complained the manager agreed that this facility was not up to standard but also put the blame on the owner s of Gun Warf Quay so how did this get passed by the council planning department the manager apologised and took the price of a bottle of wine off the bill he did say the place was getting an up grade soon but she is soon would not recommend this particular restaurant to anyone 
negative, Very friendly staff quick service but food was horrible Wet soggy burger buns with luke warm over cooked meat With london prices I expected a bit more quality 
negative, I arrived & waited almost 10mins to be seated in a restaurant that wasn t full Having ordered my meal I sat reading - & read for almost an hour When I queried the lack of food a waitress said my meal was being plated up  Must ve been some plate because 10mins passed & nothing arrived I must ve been lied to Ggrrr I took my frustration to the manager Rob Guess what I had to wait for him to arrive too  He apologised & said its not normally like this  yeah right A restaurant with management that will say customer service is very important but fail to walk the walk by providing enough staff Cost of extra staff for acceptable service - 20 an hour each over about 10 covers It s nothing unless the greed to profit over-rides customer service that is 
negative, My wife and I have been visiting this restaurant pub for many years and we even went there when it was a small local pub We visited earlier this week with my sister and her two friends on their annual visit and we always have a walk and then a meal at The Cricket The restaurant is light airy and attractive and the food has generally been OK although the real ales have been pretty poor This year was a total shock The St Austell Tribute was virtually undrinkable and when I returned it the guy at the bar looked at it and shrugged no apology There were no English bottled beers just the standard tasteless stuff As a member of Camra I do know my beers and accept that it is taste and not look that determines quality in this case both were awful  We then came to choose our food and found that basic fish and chips was 13 50 and then an extra 80p for peas We ordered the fish and chips and fish pie as there was very little else that was value for money The fish batter was greasy and unappetising and the fish pie had very little fish An expensive poor quality meal Value for money zero out of ten We mentioned the pricing to two members of staff only to receive the ubiquitous shrug of the shoulders exactly the same reaction I had to my comment about the beer  At our seat near to the door to the kitchen we were told to sit there because we had a dog we were subjected to noisy staff taking orders and discussing bookings and again when we mentioned it the response was yes you ve guessed it the shoulder shrug We were also subjected to the horrendous noise of the kitchen door squeaking After about 15 minutes they did prop the door open but nobody offered us an alternative table although the restaurant was far from full A gentleman of ample proportions who I assume was the owner or manager pushed a piece of paper across to me giving me the name and address of the pub co Heavitree who presumably own the Cricket and he suggested I write to them and complain about the squeaking door Shades of Fawlty Towers  This was a very bad experience and this establishment is going downhill and exhibits all the signs of greed and complacency that often accompany a hitherto successful venture We will not be returning and I will advise my friends to stay away 
negative, I ve been back here frequently for convenience since my earlier review despite my doubts Service has not improved And today when I put some cash into the cup for tips by the till a member of staff asked if I was pinching money from it Not going back there again 
negative, rude bar staff  over priced poor quality drinks that you can buy from any DOWN MARKET pub but with premium prices food was luke warm Went to this pub few years ago before current owners and had a fab time now we wont go back till mangement change 
negative, Having visited the place before the fire and found it to be lacking in customer service we thought that we would give it another try yesterday after shopping in Nottingham To say that it is far worse is an understatement We were greeted well enough with the lady on reception informing us that it was a little busy so the wait would be around 35-40 minutes this we understood with the amount of cars in the car park She gave us a buzzer that would flash to tell us when the table would be ready then advised us to purchase a drink from the bar while we wait that s when the problem started We waited and waited but the staff only seemed to be interested in either chatting to each other or just serving and chatting to what were obviously regulars 15 minutes we waited to be overlooked time and time again the man stood next to me even told them we had been waiting a while and STILL they overlooked us I hope the management actually read these and realise just how damaging they can be Still as long as the regulars are looked after eh The Goose up the road was very nice  just a thought 
negative, Visited this pub left very quickly Don t know whether it was the landlady but she was incredibly unfriendly and rude Not much left to say was looking forward to trying their food but won t be back Also looks really bad when members of staff are hiding behind the pub having a cigarette - understand that smokers need to entertain their habit but it looks plain messy 
negative, Absolutely disgusted Pulled up for a drive through and ordered a cheeseburger and strawberry milkshake only to be told the milk shake machine was not working so I couldn t have one Obviously I cancelled the whole order and drove off What s the point of having a bloody McDonald s without the ability to make a milk shake Why are there not maintenance engineering deployed into every McDonalds on 24 hour shifts to keep these essential machines serviceable Absolutely disgusted by the incompetence displayed and I will not be returning ever 
negative, Worst KFC I have ever been in we waited ages and the state of the tables chips all over the tray in kitchen area and chips being reheated so we walked out before getting served No comment on the food because we didn t eat there and wont be going back either 
negative, Too early to go anywhere else I went to the Lit for breakfast It took forever to come I had drunk my cold coffee by then and the breakfast was one of the worst ever The bacon was cheapo crap and shrivelled to nothing it was all just awful Don t go there for breakfast Tell your friends not to go there for breakfast Join every travel and tourism guide on the net and advise people not to go there for breakfast tell your family too 
negative,So I have been here before and 90 of the food was okay Went last night with my misses for a quick bite to eat My girlfriend has sweet and sour we shared a fried rice and I had Chicken with black bean sauce     Sweet and sour fine  chicken bits that taste have the texture of chicken and nothing to complain about  blackbean chicken sliced rubbery factory bought  tasteless and like I said it is likle rubber you can get this type of chicken at the Chinese food warehouse in middleton or Manchester it is NOT cooked fresh daily as I can order this from my local Chinese with 1* rating   So I was not rude I asked quietly for this to be taken off the bill as I did not eat it and I put the bits Id taken bites from back on the plate  Waiter said yes he will do so 5 mins later the owner comes up to me and says  I have tried the chicken on your plate and its fine  I say this is ok as it is opinion from owner and my opinion the customer   she again says it is fine   she has cooked chicken all night long and many people love it   its fine    I say AGAIN its my opinion and I do not like the sliced chicken you have it is processed shop bought that is bland in flavour   She then goes again I have tried the chicken you sent back  wish was the piece I spat out  & she told me it was fine and made me feel like it was me the problem    DO NOT COME UP TO ME ONCE I HAVE COMPLAINED AND TELL ME IT WAS FINE 50 TIMES OVER   I AM THE CUSTOMER NOT YOU   IF I DO NOT LIKE IT THAT IS IT BOTTOM LINE TAKE IT OFF MY BILL SAY YOU ARE SORRY AND THAT IS IT    NOT HAVE A ROW WITH ME IN YOUR SHOP BECAUSE I WILL DO WHAT I DID AND THROW YOU 20 POUNDS AND WALK OUT AND EXPLAIN TO ALL ON HERE THAT THE SLICED CHICKEN IS NOT GOOD  MY OPINION  FACTORY BOUGHT NOT COOKED FRESH DAILY  AND YOU CAN GET THIS FOOD FROM YOUR LOCAL CHINESE DONT BOTHER MAKING THE JOURNEY FOR 10 DISHES YOU CAN GET FOR 4 AT HOME   REALLY ANNOYED ME THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO ARGUE WITH ME FOR 15 MINS IN HER SHOP   MANNERS DISGUSTING RUDE AND NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THIS TRADE      WILL NOT BE BACK AGAIN
negative, To start off within 10 minutes of us arriving our waiter who looked like he was wearing a kids t-shirt managed to smash two glasses near to our table He was generally a nice waiter but was not attentive to the table or to many other tables I had noticed as he spent most of his time making desserts at a counter which really should be made in the kitchen or at least by someone who is wearing chef whites The food was nice enough but they are too shy on their topping and if I am paying 10 pounds for a pizza I expect it to be fully topped not with half the tomato sauce showing through the burnt cheese I personally ordered a pizza named Pollo ad Astra Leggera which consisted of dry thin bits of chicken 2 pieces of pepperdew peppers which attracted me to the dish in the first place and were rather disappointing  Cajun spices which I hadn t even noticed were on the pizza until I just looked up their menu garlic oil terribly lacking as the pizza was very dry and red onions which consisted of massive chunks of red onion that were unevenly cut and dry This would have all been tolerant but its was a pizza that had a huge hole in the middle which I quote is now filled with delicious rocket  rocket is simple and easy so I shouldn t expect anything to come from it but the fact is I am paying full price to have half of my pizza removed and then stuffed with unnecessary moneymaking rocket I also had a 3 95 pound garlic bread with mozzarella which was the size of a pita bread and had solid garlic butter on top with a layers of melted cheese which should never been on the menu at 3 95 as it costs them at the most 30p to make it I then finished off my meal by treating myself to a banoffee pie with mascarpone which I have to admit was nice mascarpone and had clearly been scoped out of a big tub the banoffee pie on the other hand was almost falling over as it reached my table you can imagine how thin it was and was certainly not 4 95 worth as I could have used 4 95 to make my own banoffee pie that big and then have enough money left over to buy a big pot of mascarpone Overall I found that it was expensive the had small portions and that they should really rename themselves to express because they certainly didn t justify the pizza part and the whole place is more like a fast food chain that should be situated in a busy shopping centre food court 
negative, Went a couple of times it was loud and noisy people stare at you constantly very poor atmosphere and when you look at the glasses when the light shines upon them they are dirty to say the least - is anyone bothered - a boys drinking parlour - that s all 
negative, First impression count and sadly it was a very bad one  Being a party of 7 we struggle for a establishment to fit us all in so when we walked in and saw a near empty cafe we thought we struck lucky however it being empty should have given us a warning  The first experience was staff members talking saying what time do we shut on a Sunday the response was 4 o clock thank goodness can t wait  I am sure you ll agree not the most welcoming greetings  There was a small range of rolls on display we asked politely if any more were available to which there was an abrupt response of No  And then the final straw my son again politely asked what the patsy s were bearing in mind there was no label to which he had a very sarcastic  rude response well the same as you normally get that was the final straw so I loudly announced my annoyance and said excuse me that was very rude and that we were leaving which did not seem to bother her at all  Totally let s down Wells avoid at All costs  With staff like that I m surprised they stay in business 
negative, Was gutted with spending 32 pound in here 2 Large Budweiser original Czech type = 11 Two burgers and chips 21 Staff were messing around the service was shockingly poor and as per previous reviewers it was not clean Floors tables and chairs all covered in food 
negative, we went to pasqualinos for my wifes birthday we decided to taste what this restaurant had to offer the arranchini was too cheesy due to too much parmesan duck leg did not taste like duck  believe it or not i am one hundered percent sure that it was not fresh i eat duck alot and i know that this duck was frozen on many occasions and used again  for dessert my wife had truffels and madeleines and beignets  i understand that they are homemade but for a fine dining restaurant to serve rubbish like that it is unnecessary as our 9 year old daughter can make better fairy cakes anyways overall this was a dissapointing meal and would not recommend it to anyone specially with the staff not wearing proper uniforms and looking rather shabby 
negative,Absolute disaster service was terrible We was a party of 6x adults What can I say Table was set from night before had to ask for table to be cleaned Table booked for window seat was sat miles from window on arrival and after asking twice for booked window seat that was requested was told that was only table available  Had to wait Ages for starter which was a Pate and was looking very dry sat on a plate Main meal came very late and had to wait long time for cutlery to eat it with and then was thrown on table with no napkins  Turkey was dryer out I had a ribeye steak which was so burned that they had to cover it with thick black gravy to hide it absolutely disgusting The desert we had to wait for even longer for was so low quality that most of it went in the waste bin We did not even wait for the coffee and biscuits as we wanted to get home and try and rescue Christmas Day  Will not ever again go through the doors of the Rushley while I am alive 
negative, I recently went to the Sportsman with friends for some lunch It was a Saturday afternoon and the pub was very quiet We waited  And waited  And waited for our food but 1 hour 15 minutes later it still hadn t arrived Went to the bar to complain and the girl said it wouldn t be much longer The staff were too busy blowing up balloons for a private party and couldn t be bothered with their customers It eventually came out and half of it was cold We asked to speak to the manager and she was ever so rude Her excuse for it being cold  It s got salad in it Salad isn t hot  She did offer us drinks on the house which we gave to two elderly ladies who had also been waiting what seemed like a lifetime for their lunch but the damage was already done  Long waiting time cold food and a very rude manager Will never go back 
negative, Just received the takeaway meals and every thing was cold greasy and undercooked last 27 they will get from me 
negative, On entering the restaurant no staff in evidence Finally given a table order taken by a friendly waitress The meal served looked nice on the plate cutting into the steak was impossible complained to the waitress who offered something else off the menu After completing the meal paid the bill No apologies were offered consequently loss of future custom  
negative,i recently visited your restaurant with my partner and was appauled with the service that was given by the staff espcially the so called manager that couldnt have been more rude if they tried the food i thought was going to be of good quality looking at the menu and i went for the scallops to start i was disappointed as the scallops seemed over cooked for my liking on to the main course which came out a good thirty minutes later i had the pheasant which again is something that i thought would be a good choice as i love game how wrong i was as the phesant had quite be well and truely over cooked when i mentioned this to one of the members of staff all i got was a very rude and abrupt response all in all i will never visit pea porridge again and i urge people not to go there in a hurry as there are many other places in bury to eat that have a lot better food and staff that are actually friendly     
negative,My wife and Inwent on a Saturday night for the first time to have an Indian meal at Curry Mahal and it was terrible the popadums were greasy and dry we asked for a new serving and they came back greasy and dry as well  the potatoe in the saag aloo was not cooked the service was terrible   
negative, Right next door to Nando s and boy do I wish I had swerved to the left instead of the right In Gloucester for one night and wasted it on this Lazy lazy lazy I can cook better ribs at home and the blue cheese sauce for the wings was I swear salad cream with something horrible added Warm colslaw - eeuuugh  Staff perfectly pleasant let down by food they probably have no control  
negative,We visited just after the restaurant opened as a group of friends There were clearly some staffing  management issues as we waited over an hour for food We got no attention at all and had to ask for everything drinks can we order etc When the food eventually did arrive it was of a reasonable standard but by then our minds had been made up Let down by service 
negative, Went with the mrs and my 2 mates 3 of us ordered the mozzarella rice balls when they come all 3 orders were stone cold This was taken of the bill and we got some piping hot ones thrown down onto the plate with a handful of greens it looked awful  Main course came out my friend asked for cheese waitress then dropped it all over him then started with black pepper before he said he wanted any Chicken lasagne was awful tasted microwaved and old  Do not go Bella italia you can easily pick up a ready meal wack it in the microwave save some pennies and not have there crap good and terrible service  On the plus side we all wet ourselves laughing with how bad it was 
negative, Very poor service it takes far too long for the food to arrive The place lacks atmosphere and is living on past glories Don t bother going if you are hungry We will not go there again 
negative, As I write this we re coming to the end of our second hour waiting for our food rediculous service all while being told it will be ready in two minutes Do not come here  Update food has arrived but half of the order has somehow been forgotten between waiter and kitchen sitting here with cold rice and no main 
negative, I cant believe this place  went in for two large or medium cod and chips easy you might think BUT  only got one small cod if you want to wait we can cook another SMALL cod we have run out of fish    As I was hungry I bought the Pie  only one there didn t bother to ask what it was  It was I admit late  8 35 pm One lot of chips was twice as big as the other  The Cod was described as regular at 3 95 but it was the smallest one I have ever bought My bill came to 10 20 the fish was OK but nothing special chips were OK but would not bother again and the meat in the pie which turned out to be meat was tough  Have stopped before and was not impressed WONT bother again not even if they gave it away  
negative,Absolutely dreadful the food was appalling over priced bland and the fish was not even cooked through properly The descriptions on the menu were inaccurate and did not reflect the food served Mr Oliver should visit in disguise and see what utter rubbish he is putting his name to 
negative, Visited with another couple last night Noisy party dominated restaurant and most waiting staff looked inexperienced and didn t seem to have a clue what they were doing Service was very slow from getting a drink through to mains Food ranged from poor to OK with exception of the egg fried rice which was superb All in all a bit of a disaster which was a shame as I have eaten there before and the food was good 
negative, I celebrated my 40th birthday in this rubbish restaurant I m blaming myself why did I chose this rubbish restaurant I brought 18 friends including my family I wanted to have a good day but this staff called kumar I think he is a manager and he said  you have to leave now and pay your bill  I was totally embarrassed and humiliated to all the people around me I will spread the news of what you ve done for me to all my colleague at hospital and to all my friends Don t go in this kind of restaurant No consideration We went there to have a peaceful and relaxing meal but it turned out to be the most rubbish restaurant I ve ever been I been to a different country like Australia Canada Rome Paris Amsterdam America but I never experienced anything like this in my entire life RUBBISH RESTAURANT NOT WORTH GOING FOOD IS RUBBISH AS WELL 
negative,Me and a group of friends headed over to smokeys hoping for a nice indulgent meal Upon walking in we were asked if we d booked which was quite surprising considering the restaurant had about 4 tables occupied out of about 25 So we said no we haven t expecting to just be seated Instead we were told that we d have to book for another night as there was only 1chef working and they d had a delivery In all my years of eating out I ve never had this happen I can understand if the restaurant is full and very popular which his place isn t  So we were left a bit bemused and wondering how on earth this place makes money I m sure he owner wouldn t be too happy if he knew this was happening The waitress told us don t take it personally although we were very calm and simply querying why we couldn t get some food  Ten minutes later we decided to call and book a table the booking was accepted  We didn t return of course as we were quite offended that we were turned away only to be able to book a table ten minutes later Strange I ll never go back and will tell my friends of this story as well Good luck smokeys 
negative, So sad to see this restaurant in a prime position in Fowey in such a terrible dilapidated condition A real eyesore Just hope that new owners will make something special of this place and it doesn t just become the same as many others - fish and chips and pasties Nothing wrong with this but Fowey needs something different and more upmarket Rick and Nathan where are you 
negative, What a disappointment I booked this place based on time Outs critics  choice for Manchester Now I will never trust another review from Time Out as this wasn t just bad it was terrible How did it ever get critics  choice in Time out Did they pay for the review Ok to start the decor not sure what it s trying to be a heavy nautical them but nowhere near the sea The music very very loud and not very pleasant OK if you want to go clubbing but I booked restaurant to eat not to dance on the table The food cold and tasteless and very expensive  Starters didn t turn up at same time no taste to any of them and i really do mean no taste it all taste of nothing Main courses all cold When manager asked me how it was i requested he go away as he would only spoil what was already an unpleasant experience Thinking i was the only on not happy he said to one of my party oh well you can t please everyone to which my friend replied but mine was awful too and cold At that point they offered 2 deserts to compensate Couldn t muck these up as did not need cooking I seriously felt ripped off by this place and embarrassed as I had chosen it to meet friends i had not seen for quite some time The only good point our waiter was very good and tried his very best but i would suggest he get a job in a place with decent food Go if you like tasteless and pretentious and don t mind being ripped off for it otherwise avoid like the tasteless plague it is 
negative,Been a few sunday afternoons now seems to slowley going down the pan this sunday terrible service stone cold food slat on the table asked for malt vinegar said not sure what that was  I have every time we go  sign on door no longer taking cards Heres the worst bit prawns full of the sh  lines not washed disgusting Spare ribs all bits of bone nothing really on them  3 for the smallest bottle of budwiser made the table next to us ordered a sizzler dish it arrived didnt sizzle told then to take back  they were the only other people in and us nobody at the counter bothering about us or the other table just chatting away with them selves and the small children running around making noises its a shame used to be just average but now total rubbish in every way I even told the waitress when she asked was everything ok  with most of the food left and all the dirty prawns on the table They are disgusting she asked me what was up with them   I said tell your so called chef to eat them iv got work tomorrow  Will never set foot in the dump ever again take heed go somewhere else I don t even think they ar bothered any more DUMP DUMP 
negative, Tried to go here today with my wife and 3 children after we had the boat trip Sign outside stating dress code  no tracksuit bottoms  Damn  i was wearing tracksuit bottoms Asked why this was and was just told go home and change by a lovely young girl Erm  no i won t go home which is 40 miles away to change to spend my money in your establishment You aren t the only place to eat in chester Never have i heard or seen a dress code at a restaurant at 2pm in an area that is for families Stupid dress code stupid manager power hungry woman In the end  we went up in the town and spent 80ish in Nandos Well done 
negative, My wife and I went in the one at St Davids Railway Station Wife ordered breakfast sandwiches and two coffees Staff could not understand English and mostly ignored her or did not speak Place to avoid if possible 
negative, Makes Big Luke s and Taybarn s look like 5* establishments Food was cold very little choice Crispy Duck tasted so sweet it is hard to believe it is not left over helpings of Duck dishes Would explain why it was the size of sawdust Staff rude and very slow to clear tables despite the fact the place was near empty The new Mr Lau s is the place to go in Newcastle 
negative, We visited on our recent trip to manchester after hearing about the place from friends  The decor inside was very mismatched tired and not that tidy or clean  We were seated at the table and given a menu we then had an incredibly long wait for our order to be taken When the tea and china aas eventually brought out the waiter just plonked it onto the table without any care we then had another long wait until the cakes and sandwiches arrived  We had the Queens tea for two The sandwiches were just ok not much flavour to them though The scone was ok but fairly dry and got stuck in your throat The cake was a roughly cut up piece of flavourless dry cake with a splodge of purple icing on top There was a lemon tart that didn t taste of lemon and was topped with the most sticky and tastless meringue i ve ever come across The meal was finished off with what was supposed to be some sort of cheesecake in a glass it just tasted sweet and nothing else  The service was awful there where lots of young waiters around but they just stood and chatted rather than attending the tables  At the end of our meal we waited for ages once we requested the bill we also mentioned to our waiter that it was very disappointing but he just seemed to ignore it  Overall it was definitely not worth the visit Overpriced and tasteless food combined with awful service meant we didn t enjoy what was supposed to be a nice romantic afternoon tea We will definitely not be visiting again and would not recommend the tea room to anyone else 
negative, Went to this branch of Prezzo on 26th April We were a large group and they seemed incapable of catering for a group of 10 Funnily enough the same issue arose at another branch  The food itself was ok though the bolognese was such a small portion - it could ve come from the kids menu  They also told us we weren t allowed a jug of tap water we had also ordered several alcoholic and soft drinks but they said we could each have a glass of tap water This just seemed quite pointless and it took over an hour just to get the glass of water Crazy  When the pizzas arrived they weren t cut and there were no pizza wheels provided which made it quite difficult with the very blunt standard knife  Overall quite a negative experience and not worth the price Avoid  won t be returning to this branch but there is a Prezzo just nearby other side of Trafalgar Square towards Leicester Square that was much better 
negative,Sadly this review is the worst I have written on Trip Advisor and I have commented on hotels in Ethiopia We finished off a terrific family weekend by booking Sunday lunch at Draycote Hotel for 24 guests When we arrived we were initially surprised that we were not to have the Carvery meal we had be told to expect when we booked and confirmed nor a separate room away from the rest of the restaurant  However the restaurant was set out pleasantly and after being seated with drinks food orders were taken It then went rapidly downhill or slowly depending upon your point of view   The starters were clearly an indication of the obvious traumas that were happening in the kitchen The prawn cocktail for example consisted of a number of unshelled pawns completely covered in sauce that had to be extracted and pealed before they could be eaten When the main courses arrived over an extended period the food was served on cold plates and was cold I waited for a further 10 minutes before the first vegetables arrived which was better than some who still had nothing after a further 30 minutes What food that did sporadically arrive was clearly not cooked by a hotel chef or one that had pride in his her art  On discussion with the duty manager it was agreed that we would cut our losses and leave without the need to pay for what some had already partly consumed out of desperation Clearly the Draycote Hotel could not cope with a party so large on that Sunday which is surprising as they advertise as a wedding venue  In all this I pay tribute to the young waitresses and receptionist who were clearly distressed and embarrassed about the situation with which they were faced and who did their best to resolve an impossible situation However our wonderful weekend ended rather disappointingly in the car park as we said our goodbyes and started our long journeys home To be fair to the Hotel the Hotel Manager did contact us the next day to profusely apologise in person and explain the problem we faced In order to move on we have accepted  The Hotel website states We are passionate about offering our guests an excellent dining experience  Was our experience just a  bad day at the office
negative, Popped in for a take-away on a Monday evening Was going to leave immediately as queue was so long Helpful girl on reception asked us not to to leave as she would serve us straight away She did this it was slightly uncomfortable as others were still waiting Anyway I went ahead When the whole queue had cleared I was still waiting for my order It eventually arrived but it was clear it wasn t all there A fairly offhand Nando person went through it and confirmed bits were missing and some were wrong I was told only a couple of minutes to sort it This of course turned into an interminable wait again Eventually I got it home not before the original helpful girl winked at me instead of asking why I now appeared to be living in the restaurant to find that I had things like mashed potato in a box instead of what I d actually ordered 
negative, Just sat at my table with a breakfast platter that was already send back for being nearly cold  only to get another equally luke warm plate If been here over 45 minutes waiting so I ve managed to eat only half before giving up How can you mess up a simple full breakfast Waiting staff good but the cook needs a sharp poke with a stick 
negative, This place was a joke from start to finish My family came to visit for the theatre and have a meal and we picked the living room because it looked nice from the outside We then informed the staff we had an hour to eat before we had to leave before the show  No problem they replied may I add that only one other table was taken  The food turned up late so we left half way through not to miss the show The staff walked past several times never checked on us spilt food on my mother I had to go and ask to order more drinks  The the final straw was then the waiter claimed it wasn t his fault as he d only just started when he actually took our order I asked to speak to the manager she was to busy changing a barrel in the bar  I replied no problem I ll wait staff reply again from the manager was she will still be busy why are you been like this for what is your problem  The bar is empty she has time to speak to me we are always quiet was the final remark and I can see why  I tried to call head office but no one has got back to me This is the first ever negative review I have ever give anywhere But my family and I think it was well earned  Living Room retrain you rude staff and get your manager to care about the few customers you have 
negative,I ordered a take away from the Shiplu because we hadn t been for about a year and used to visit a lot between 2005 - 2010 I genuinely wish I hadn t bothered  The standards are shocking and when constructive feedback was given I was met with an obnoxious owner who insisted I was mistaken I tried to redeem an offer and was informed that it wasn t valid it was and the owner couldn t possibly be wrong because he has a degree  I have never been treated as badly before and if you re considering spending money here on sub standard food and even worse service I suggest you seek other quality alternatives because there are plenty  Very sad to see a quality building with no substance 
negative, Having decided on this restaurant in Camden over many others around this turned out to be one of the biggest eating out mistakes I and my friend have ever made We were pestered to order drinks even before opening the menu we then ordered an antipasto to share and a beer and ordered our mains a pizza and a ravioli Halfway through the antipasto a waitress was headed our way with a pizza and pasta dish realising the mistake she turned on her heels back to the kitchen were they were put on hold by the oven I presume Some time later when we have finished out starter this was taken away and a dried out pizza and pasta dish were served utterly tasteless and ruined When the waiter was told all we got was a shrug of the shoulders the plates which were still half full taken away and a bill for 40  Never again there are so many restaurants close by I wouldn t recommend this place to anyone In a word Vile 
negative, We asked to set up a tab The man behind the bar asked what table were we sitting on We said sorry we could nt find a number on our table He said follow me  We went to our table and he could nt find a number on our table or any of the other tables He did not apologise He had a go at another member of staff for not putting the table numbers out The resturant was quiet at the time with very few people Our party of five paid for our drinks and left the resturant We had a nice meal with friendly service at a resturant just up the road August 2013 
negative, Good restaurant ruined by new owners why change something that worked so well Disappointed ex customer 
negative, Terrible service rude staff got it wrong and didn t care Rubbish burger Someone s clearly taken their eye off the ball Avoid 
negative, Whatever happened to this establishment in the space of a few weeks Sunday lunch here used to be a warm inviting environment with great food and cool live jazz Today however it was chilly service poor and food bland to say the least What ` pity 
negative,I have been to black and blue a couple of times before and on both occasions had a nice meal and some decent if unspectacular service  The first time I had to tell the bartender exactly what I meant when I requested a wet Gin Martini with a twist but she seemed new and was eager to listen and please me as the customer  So when I was heading for a late showing in the cinema I had no hesitation in taking my girlfriend in for some late drinks before the movie  We got in around 22 20 and were welcomed by the door man and I informed him we just wanted to get drinks He was more than happy and pointed us to the bar  What happened next left me very embarrassed and let down as I had been telling my girlfriend what a nice place it was  We got to the bar and started looking at the cocktails menus and waited for about 3 minutes for someone to come to the bar A bartender came over and just said NO MORE COCKTAILS GUYS and with that picked up the boston tins and put them in the glass wash behind him He then promptly left the bar again He didn t greet us or welcome us at all and after telling us no more cocktails  he didn t offer us any alternatives  Suffice to say we just walked straight out and got some cocktails at another bar 
negative, Decided to have a family lunch at the Willow Tree Firstly tried to order drinks at bar Well pathetic The barman should be sacked and the manager replaced  Then later I joined the queue to order food Same barman Got to the front of the queue and he disappeared off to serve a lady who appeared at the end of the bar I questioned it but he refused to serve me before her despite there being ageing people in the long queue behind me We left and had food in town  Don t go there    Paul 
negative, RIP OFF RIP OFF RIP OFF  A recent visit to this restaurant was from our point of view an absolute disaster as far as value for money is concerned  THERE WAS NO A LA CARTE MENU AVAILABLE AND THE SET MENUS WERE NOT VALUE FOR MONEY  All the food for the three of us for the whole meal could have been put on to one normal size dinner plate and still left plenty of room  The service was good and what little food there was was well cooked but this place can surely not afford to continue in business unless they up their game  A well known very successful businessman once told me that it was much easier and important to retain existing customers than get new ones How right he is  The Black Swan has just lost three possible regular customers  Terrible value for money and a big mistake not to have an al a carte menu available at all times  RIP OFF RIP OFF RIP OFF 
negative, In fairness the prices at Foundation are good once you finally get served Having been called by a sales rep offering a table for my birthday I rallied some people together for a evening of drinks Received a call in the morning to say the table was given to a someone who paid to book so I now have 12 people and nowhere to sit  thanks Despite this we still went along finally managed to get the free drinks that we d been promised but not without talking to three members of particularly unhelpful staff Service at the bar was VERY slow Every table was reserved so absolutely nowhere to set your drink down or to put food anywhere We were all really disappointed This venue was considerably better when it was The Langley I m afraid to say there are many more venues with better energy and better management in Coventry Garden 
negative, After recent change in management I phoned to check dogs were still welcome in the bar as we were planning on visiting for a meal as we d done many times before On the phone I was told yes they re still welcome so as we walked in the door I asked if there was anywhere we couldn t sit The answer was you can sit anywhere except on the carpeted area which left 2 tables one of which was beside the pool table which would be fine if I wanted a pool cue in my ear The other seat was virtually out the door and the seat itself was rotten We were invited to sit outside as well which was good of them   Needless to say we walked out and went elsewhere Customer service not present here and despite what we were told dogs are no longer welcome 
negative, I decided to visit the Bellflower  although I was aware of it s mixed reviews  on a Monday lunchtime That was my first mistake Myself my partner my son and grandson waited 20 minutes for soft drinks half an hour plus for food it took a rollicking by the manager to even get our food out of the kitchen The food was very poor quality when as I say it eventualy arrived and YES it may be cheap & cheerful but that s all Don t question how it s cooked - Don t even think where it s come from and as to it s purity least said the better Never ever again  I want to remain alive 
negative, My wife booked for afternoon tea at 2 30 pm Sunday 15th November We arrived a liitle early Place looked noce not very busy We were shown to our table We were then informed that chef couldn t do afternoon tea as he had run out of ingredienrts This was done with a very matter of fact attitude and a cursory apology Sorry can t do it The waiter then tried to blame us for not specifyning afternoon tea when booking - but they force you to use an automated telephone booking system that doesn t allow the type of booking to be specoified The unsympathetic waiter then proceeded to take my wife to his desk to show her the booking screen to prove it wasn t his fault OUTRAGEOUS We were not even offered a menu to choose an alternative lunch As we left my wife thanked the man for ruining her birthday treat he said it wasn t his fault I suppose it wasn t personally his fault but he was the noly representative of this shameful organisation that we had contact with There is a sign outside advertising afternoon tea 12-5 pm every day They are liers and charlatans And rude ones at that Stay Away 
negative, On the way back from Whitby on new years day we decided to call at the Fox and Rabbit but due to traffic arrived too late to have lunch so decided to call anyway and have a drink whilst our daughter fed our fifteen month old granddaughter As we got the baby out of the car my wife went into the pub and explained the situation only to be told that the consumption of your own food was not permitted Now for us to have walked in asked for a glass of water to share and then begun to eat our own sandwiches I d say fair play but to deprive a toddler of her lunch when we were willing to purchase drinks seems harsh to say the least 
negative, Took a trip here today mainly due to the cheap prices on the menu  Staff were very friendly and offered us the latest deals and asked if we had been here before I ordered the mixed grill and my partner order the rack of ribs I can honestly say it was the worst mixed grill I had eaten the meat literally tasted like it had been cooked last week it was so dry The rack of ribs should have been renamed to fat of ribs as there was no meat  I would not advise anyone to eat here the food is below the low price tag I would not of paid half the price for my meal  If you want to be chewing your food until your next meal out then this is the place 
negative, No Turkey I am afraid but this has been replaced by chicken No problem I love chicken so much that I have chicken 4 times a week as a main meal Asked for chicken only and then went on to select my vegetables Great no roast potatoes The roasted potatoes were brung out five minutes later Back to the table and took one bite out of the chicken This was removed from my mouth immediately This was cold and not fresh chicken breast This was like the cheap frozen chicken breasts that you buy in bulk from Iceland Absolutely disgusting dried out cold rubbish Vegetables were cold Potatoes were nice and freshly cooked The lady came up to clear the table and my plate was full of meat If she bothered to ask if everything was OK I would have said no Anyway she never bothered but hey none of the staff could actually be bothered from start to finish anyway Not a smile between them Place is a bit run down and the red seat that we were sitting on was all worn and peeling away Not worth the money Plenty of places to visit around the same area for something to eat 
negative, Well was expecting something perhaps a little special after the refit and the publicity hype  unfortunately was not to be and very poor  Staff not really interested almost blase to point of being rude  Set menu limited and when I requested an option to what they had run out of  nothing offered other than the other choices which were not really what I had in mind  Main course battered cod asked for a change from chips to some kind of potato and that after some pushing required an ok from the kitchen  that never the case before Sounds like a budget gone wrong  Went for the prawn and crab linguine  which arrived swimming in some kind of balsamic sauce but was unable to locate the crab as it was disguised as a chorizo or something similar  Linguine soup Plate felt grubby on the underside  Yuk  Overall LESS than average on all fronts Over priced - poor service - food sub standard  First and Last Time for me which is a shame as I had previously eaten there on quite a few occasions but sadly no more as there are much better choices else where for sure 
negative, Visited to celebrate sons A level achievements Gold club members Table booked not available when we turned up Gabriela Genz manager needs some serious customer relations training Would no longer recommend however Carluccios around the corner far better on every level Returning JAMIE OLIVER so called gold club cards simply not feeling the love for loyalty 
negative, I was appalled with the service at the Royal Oak The bar wasn t particularly busy and yet we were still left waiting for 20 minutes at the bar to order a drink When it eventually became our turn to be served one of the two bar staff walked off to clear tables before serving us and the other member of staff a blonde male decided to argue with myself when I questioned him regarding his colleague walking off  Needless to say I wont be visiting the Royal Oak again with my colleagues The service is slow and the staff are rude 
negative, Tonight we had a takeaway from this restaurant delivered to our home they got it wrong ordered a cheesy garlic Nan but got a Keema Nan when I phoned to complain the manager was aggressive arrogant and very rude needless to say they won t be getting my money again 
negative, Very poor service The beer was off and the management refused to exchange Please check the date on any bottle purchased from this establishment 
negative, Went here on Tuesday and had a typical Wetherspoons grill no problems cheap and cheerful so went back on Thursday with the family and the place was heaving The kitchen couldn t cope the bar was short staffed and the rest of the staff were surly and unhelpful The table had been used by a young family and looked like a car crash Despite repeated requests it took half an hour to get it cleared and the spillages were just wiped around the table with a dry cloth When the food did arrive half the meals were cold Unheated chicken on the chicken and ribs same with the bombay potatoes naan breads served straight out of the packet and smeared with garlic butter to produce a garlic naan but not even warmed under the grill Then there were samosas and onion bajis that had bern in the oven for hours and couldnt be broken up without a hammer and chisel While trying to eat we were treated to the sound of tables and chairs being slammed down around us as staff tried to straighten the pub up admirable but the way they were thrown around it was obvious that tempers were frayed Ok I appreciate that if you pay 8 for a pint and a curry you get a pint and a 5 curry not a Veraswamy quality dish but at least get the basics right Hot food good service Love Wetherspoons Just not this one 
negative, Absolutely atrocious overpriced fast food dive No customer service whatsoever disinterested kids serving and revolting looking food We walked out it was that bad  
negative,I mean my title by saying it in French and being French Although it was delicious food I totally disagree with this kind of cuisine It is a very expensive type of tapas where you are advised to take more as very light why not telling the client that you will be hungry after the meal as we were 4 of us  We added cheese but although called the Dairy no cheese board except a plate with 4 fines slices of cheese and 1 slice of bread So if anyone expects to be fed no Just a taste  Eat before or after rush to your fridge once you have paid around 260 for 4  2 bottles of wines and previous drink  Staff was nice but does not engage too much and you seat on a stool for that price No return for us for sure 
negative, Came to Shrewsbury as a mid-point for family to meet and have lunch- booked here as it looked very nice with excellent reviews  Unfortunately it is probably the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant On arrival we ordered drinks and waited 10 minutes before the waiter came to take our food order and advised the drinks are just coming- these did not come for another 10 minutes after the order We then waited 45 minutes without any notice of our food and had to ask a waitress if there was a problem with our order She advised she would go and check She did not return with an update although I could see there was an issue from the 10 minute discussion between the staff that followed The food then arrived after 55 minutes- the roast beef and pork arrived either tough or near-raw with two anaemic roast potatoes watery gravy and some uncooked veg on the side The veg tart was tasteless and the steak burger was a non-descript grey lump with some uncooked chips on the side We didn t receive an apology for the hour wait on the food 
negative, We used to go to the Fox and Hounds but stopped going about six months ago after the portions got smaller and the standard of cooking deteriorated  We heard that it had new management so decided to give it another chance I checked their website and saw that they had a offer on main courses on Wednesdays so I booked a table for four people for Wedneday 26th We ordered chicken supreme pork loin salmon fillet and a Classic beefburger When the meals arrived we were disappointed by the size of them For example my meal consisted of a small tepid slightly undercooked salmon fillet sat on a potato rosti the diameter of a beermat and about the thickness of three beermats surrounded by a clear salsa sauce and with four small pieces of broccoli artfully arranged on the plate It was as if nouvelle cuisine had returned with its pretentious undersized portions but without its quality My partner said her pork loin would have been ideal as a starter The burger looked like something from a low cost supermarket s value range The chicken did not have the expected rich white supreme sauce  We consoled ourselves with the thought that because of the we were effectively paying half price for half size meals We were wrong  When the bill arrived we were charged the full price for all four meals When we queried this with the waiter we were told that the pub was under new management and the offer had been stopped When we said it was still advertised on the pub s website the waiter apologised and said the website needed updating but we would still have to pay the full price  We left still hungry feeling doubly cheated first by the meanness of the meals and secondly by the pub reneging on its advertised deal  We will be voting with our feet and will not be returning 
negative, wow where do we start over on business in london decided to go to the chiltern firehouse  nothing too say but just f=dreadful   why do people go  are they paid 
negative, Didn t like this place been twice and been disappointed twice Arena chutney Tandori up the road is better and Balti Spice just down the same road is 10 times nicer the service in both is also better Fairly priced but the service was a bit rushed and impersonal the food was nothing special as mentioned to balti spice best in St Helens in my opinion is far better shame as the restaurant is decorated nicely and its a comfortable place to eat just not for me 
negative, Welcome was was quite cold The USP of the pub is that you can sit outside on the canal side Outside however all of the tables had not been cleaned or cleared Even when another customer asked for a table to be wiped over the waiter went inside came out with a rag cleaned the one table and walked by all of the other tables on his way back in This was not because of short staffing as there were three members of staff gassing at the bar There was no time given to digest the stater before the main course came The main course itself was pretty poor The Watermill has a great location and beautiful building it would be interesting to know what influence the adjacent Travelodge has 
negative, Visited on a Monday afternoon The waitress was completely obnoxious with a terrible attitude It took 30 minutes to have our table cleaned then a further 15 minutes to take our drinks order We all ordered Carvery when we went up to get it all of the meat looked dry and all the veg were brown and looked totally un-appetising and for 8 50 totally not worth the money We asked the chef if any fresh veg would be brought out she said they might bring some in 15 minutes  So we decided to pay for our drinks and leave I would advise anyone planning to go here for a meal to go somewhere else as this was a totally awful experience 
negative, A real let down Been using Beefeater restaurants for 40 plus years and tonight s meal was poor The fillet steak was under weight and was half the size it is normally Asked for side orders and they never arrived Waitress never came back to ask how our food was Had to get another waiter to get our bill Wish i hadn t bothered going as i was hungry when i left and my wallet 37 lighter 
negative, probably the worst meal I ve ever eaten out   ordered chicken pie  got a chicken pie which was drier than an old leather sole from a pair of my old boots chips were at best warm and the peas were cold  Both mine and my wife s drinks glasses were washed previously in the bottom of a river bed  at the very best  
negative, The cheap takeaway in West Drayton high street has far tastier food at 1 3 the price 9 95 for crappy seafood dish of mussles and beef lo mein  each that is  Nice posh place to dine in though  Probably why it costs so much  Do not waste your time or dough here  
negative, Fooled by the lovely outside appearance and welcoming signs we dived in on the way home from business in Liverpool for a satisfying carvery I think the title of this review says it all but maybe I should back up such a statement We pulled up on an empty car park and entered Warm welcome yes a tad early we waited 10 minutes for our prepaid carvery Voucher in hand we approached the serving area Ok first up for the 12 noon carvery and no one else waiting In front of us a few bowls of vegs a bowl of roast tats and a mixing bowl of weak looking gravy The main attraction if you will excuse the pun was a small long rib of beef a joint of pork and joint of gammon My partner first asked for the beef as soon as sliced I knew the rare appearance would not suit her but it was not just the chefs choice of cooking but the joint itself that destroyed it Running with veins of fat that may have dissolved if cooked over a long enough term but I doubt it  The pork was cooked and served Nothing more Yes it was cooked through with its 1 4 inch of soggy fat on the outside and veins of fat running through it Perhaps if the chef had been challenged enough to cut the fat off half way through and turn it into crackling we may have had a half hearted attempt at presenting pork The gammon joint was thrown in the oven again nothing more The idea of removing an outer layer of fat or scoring its outside over seen Maybe a temperature or weight check prior to cooking may have supplied the correct times for serving Ohh did I mention vegs  Undercooked carrots leeks prepared to last the duration of service and cabbage BUT oositive if you like well cooked roast potatoes that aren t crispy your in luck Bottom line awful The waiter came to collect the plates smiling and graceful and asked with all sincerity How was your meal I answered with equal sincerity  Probably the worst carvery I have every had  After a lovely and successful weekend away the last thing on my mind was to take on a manager who had the the lack of respect to try and pass this as a quality carvery On visiting TripAdvisor my decision was correct any manager who can ignore or dismiss this public show of poor reviews would be better served stacking shelves in a back street shop not running a pub I do note a positive review from a local who enjoys the scampi and burger I am glad they can at least they cook this simple meal I feel sorry for those who fall into the same honey trap as we did A good exterior appearance does not say anything for the food the empty car park should have said it all This is one true example that the TripAdvisor reviews say it all Travel a few miles further on and you will find a far better meal Unfortunately for us we paid twice and sat twice to get a good sunday lunch The Fish Pool Inn our savour Old English Inns you should be ashamed  
negative, While on a business trip felt like having some good Turkish food judging from the reviews for dinner I was on my own and there were a few 4 seat tables available but none single ones The waiter host had a look around the place and hesitantly said that they don t have any tables for a single person Obviously decided I m not going to be a good business offered me only takeaway When I said that I would like to eat in he thought that it would be actually a better idea to tell me that the available tables are actually booked which clearly was not the case Even if their food is supposed to be good attitude is as essential part of the experience so Would Not Recommend 
negative, Restaurant looks nice when you first go in but it ends there Menu is your usual italian menu with one diffrence its not cheap and actually alot worse than any other restaurant in walking distance not fresh and no flavour service is no better than the food save your money go elsewhere 
negative,The Folly Isle of Wight  60 for Christmas lunch = WASTE OF TIME & MONEY What a waste of money The Folly charging 60 per person for plated food on Christmas day  living up to it s name kids running around bar areas sticky tables and dirty cutlery  Unkempt staff serving slowly with about as much personality as an upturned boat on the shoreline The venue had no seasonal ambience at all people were crammed in like a Christmas turkey farm  This is nothing more than a spit and sawdust pub for yachts people not a dining experience worth 60 a head   There are far nicer places to have a Christmas lunch on the Island at a fraction of the price Dont waste your time and money here on seasonal special events  Not forgetting the terrible condtions of the road pot holes on an unkept road making it a risk to your exhaust and suspension if you take anything else other than a 4wheel drive Really this was a hidious experience  
negative, Went to Bradford to visit family members living there so thought I d take some food for them so l placed a order for thirteen starters And two faloodas as I love them the waitress told me twenty minutes so l told her not to rush the order so that mistakes aren t made and I d call back 30 to 40 minutes later  Went back after forty minutes and picked up the order at that time I asked if they had checked the order oh yes everything is there Came home and discovered straight away discovered that my faloodas were missing on closer inspection found two small tubs of raw onion in place of thirteen tubs of salad which should accompany the starters and should at the very least have tomato cucumber lemon and lettuce  
negative, Service not pleasant I complained in writing and they never replied 2 it is a worrying fact that the Food Standards Agency last inspection states a score of just 2 improvement necessary It should be a 5 I do not recommend this restaurant I never complete reviews but it was necessary to write this one 
negative, Had a table booked with views of the broards in the bar When we arrived our table was reserved for friends of the manager so ended up with views of the car park We were then told we have to order our own food at the bar  and when we did the friends were getting table service  We ordered 4 meals  after 15 mins 2 meals came out and they said the other 2 are on there way 10 mins of waiting still no meals for theother 2 So we went to the bar and they said that they had lost the order and would have to start again and would take our food away to reheat iit  So in the end we asked for a full refund and left  And made our way to the jolly farmers in ormesby Which was amazing food So i wouldn t recommend the boathouse unless you want to just have a drink to look at the views Very poor and i would say considering they spent a lot of money doing it they should have proper menus not paper ones 
negative, Having read great reviews we booked in for Sunday lunch as the midpoint of a 6 mile walk A somewhat frosty reception although a nice bar area We had to ask where the restaurant was and waited an age for menus Radiator was on full blast on a sunny day so the room was very warm we asked if the door next to us and the patio area could be opened nothing happened Bread arrived with the starters The onion soup was insipid although the other starters weren t bad The Sunday roasts arrived with vegetables on the plate unfortunately covered in a very salty gravy  The broccoli was overcooked limp and khaki  The mustard and butter were in sachets On a hot day the pleasant bottle of Muscadet wasn t in a wine cooler The sea trout was covered in a thick pesto with little flavour and a lot of pinenuts  Our farewell included the comment  you didn t eat all your vegetables  As a generalisation Sunday lunches can often be a poor reflection of a restaurant but we would still be reluctant to try the Carpenters Arms again  
negative, A meal out for 8 of us I opted for the 2 italian burgers which were nearly 12 When they came out it was like looking at 2 mini doughnuts Very expensive and over rated It is so noisy in there not a place for a quality meal It wont be long before it closes and ends up a charity shop to go with all the others in the high street Again its an example of London prices for food and drink on the IOW When are these business s going to realise people get paid nothing over here The winter months will be the tell tail sign when all the tourists go home 
negative, Very economical 3663 ping ping food need to change cooking oil more frequently as old oil causes bad guts Friendly staff and all round atmosphere 
negative, After hearing rave reviews we arrived after booking a table to be greeted by a very abrubt and rude tout outside We were then taken to the restaurant next door in the basement which transpires is the sister restaurant to Aladin  A couple were disrupted during their meal with the tout taking the chaps personal items from the table next to them and placing them on their table without even asking - we were then ushered to sit uncomfortably close next to them which we declined  We then went to the other side of the restaurant then only to be sat next to another couple who were also moved after they complained  Only soft drinks offered - you have to go down the off licence down the road if you want alcohol - something I had to do after ordering the main course  Tables very small food great - but everything else about this place lets the food down which is a shame  Very rude staff - defo one to avoid on a first date  in fact avoid it 
negative, This place used to be a pub I popped in for a pint while waiting for a take away from next door When I said that I only wanted a drink I was told that the had a 4 pint rule Apparently if you want a fourth pint they don t want you it is a restaurant not a pub I won t be going back   
negative, Aweful experience food was inedible looked good on entry did not live up to expectations Would not go again  
negative, ordered a king prawn came with no prawns on complaining the waiter told me they were in the sours I think that if the menu says King prawn then you should be able to tell that its King prawn will not be retuning there The restaurant was clean and the waiter was polite 
negative,Came here with a group of friends sat by the door Knew we d made a mistake when we arrived - it smelt of urine and stale smoke - but hoped that the empty seats were indicative of the nice day outside They weren t Scones were terrible and although menu says they were homemade the manager eventually conceded they were bought elsewhere We ordered three pots of tea and they decided to combine all three together into one relatively small pot Menu was unclear and it wasn t clear that they charged 2 00 for adding clotted cream to a small slice of Treacle Tart taking the price to 5 60 when you can get a lovely Treacle Tart from Rick Stein s for 3  Service was terrible rude unpleasant and argumentative when we queried the added 2 00 Worst place in the otherwise lovely Padstow Probably Definitely avoid 
negative,This used to be a fantastic curry house but sadly no more  We ordered three different curries and all of them were rammed with onion - I think in an attempt to bulk up the dishes Now I know that onion is a stock curry ingredient but it was almost as if the chef had made the curry and then chopped up an additional onion into each serving  I d much rather pay a little extra and get my curry as it should be instead of the restaurant cutting corners to keep their prices attractive  The service was efficient but rather abrupt We ll be avoiding this place until we hear that it has been improved 
negative,Lat summer tried this pub and it was FANTASTIC Arrived this month kept waiting 45 mins for service NO wasnt busy was at the end of service very little activity from the kitchen  Given two menus which one the real one ordered mains my smoked pork dry sweet very smoked really horrid another plate was some seafood nasty taste as well Wifes chicken choriso pie dry uneviting The two with me went for the pudding my wifes merangue nasty and sisters chocolate thing like something from a transport cafe Wasnt asked if all ok even waited over 1 2 hr for pudding Service very poor food dreadful After last year when I actually gave a brilliant write up wouldnt recommend it again What a dreadful shame as we live up the road and it s nice to have somewhere descent
negative, Tried the fish and chips after reading the great reviews      Boy how wrong they were I am a great fish and chip lover and would travel miles for the right package the fish batter was more white than brown soggy in fact the chips also white and the so called mushy peas  I should have known when I seen him boil the kettle as they turned out to be green boiled water I really don t like to write anything bad about anyone or place but you have to be honest and a spade is a spade where I come from so its a big FAT give it a miss if you are a fish and chip lover I mean a real fish and chip lover with the golden brown batter and lovely brown chips with no sharp edges One other point the plastic fork I asked for cut my lip as the edges are very sharp not blaming the owner for this But one to watch out for the kids you don t want to spoil the visit to the seaside sitting in A&E I just cant rate it at all 
negative,I decided to treat the wife and I to a fish lunch and we thought we-d try this place after such good reviews Unfortunately when we drew up the shutters were down and there was a for sale notice attached to the building Shame we didn t try this place earlier 
negative, We have been to this restaurant happily many times before This time though the service was lacking and we had a wait to be seated a wait to order drinks and then another for food orders As for the wait for food to be brought to the table 40 mins for a steak is just unacceptable  especially when it arrives half ash and half raw The staff were then very rude and laughed about what had happened as it was funny  Unsurprisingly I did not pay and will not be returning 
negative, I live in London and really wanted to like this place  but quite frankly it smells like a sewage Maybe if you sit outside you can t smell the nastiness but inside is gross It smells like it has been there for 50 years and never been clean but it is a newer place Placing us next to the toilet without any choice doesn t help  Some of the staff looked cracked out and are very disrespectful they like to pull a face as well as have an attitude It looks like something you d find in a seedy part of the city like Hackney or Peckham I will avoid this place in the future There are plenty of other places in the area to have a better experience  Judging by reviews this was not a one off A shame because it s a really nice setting but the place is obviously run by a bunch of amateurs who have just left college and the chef should be ashamed of what he or she is sending out of the kitchen Steer well clear 
negative, It s a real shame with this one I Love KFC but this particular one is a disgrace  The staff are less than helpful the store is almost always messy and floor is dirty But to top it off the wait to even get served is usually around 15 mins That s not counting the time it takes to get your food  This KFC just never has any food ready you usually have to wait another 10-15 mins for the food once you ve ordered  I ve even had an argument with one of the staff both me and another customer were served Pepsi that was just soda and tasted horrible we had both told the staff separately to then be told that obviously we were wrong and it couldn t be the drink  If you want KFC go to one in Gorleston or Great Yarmouth both of them are great KFCs 
negative, Worst experience in my life  Waited 1 hours for the drink to be served  Never got serve the mains dish had to ask for the bill  the drink were horrible Had to pop to nandos for a decent meal Staff was not even apologetic 
negative, On Saturday 16th July a friend and I decided to have a trip out to Twickenham for a leisurely lunch  Not knowing Twickenham very well we decided to just randomly pick the look of a place we liked The place was Bellissimo Ristorante Firstly on arrival we were greeted by a very sullenly looking waiter However I thought I would not take it personally as sometimes people have bad days We were then asked if we had booked a table I replied no is that a problem The waiter replied well all these tables are booked  I would like to state at this point That it was about 4 30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was practically empty barring three tables that were occupied The waiter then said well you can sit here walking over to a table situated by the toilets   Or he said you can sit outside Hmmmmmm As you can imagine that did not boad well with us being as I said the restaurant was not busy at this point I suspect noting the look on our faces the waiter then said well you could sit upstairs then as we were about to agree to that a reserved table miraculously became available Who knows maybe someone called and cancelled as we were standing there So we are now seated and looking forward to our fabulous lunch and pleasant service Sadly this was not to be I will make this part of my review very brief As I have used up a lot of your reading time setting the seen for you all The sullen waiter returned His mood had not improved The waiter was unattentive however the food was served promptly  The food dare I call it that We both had a pastabake dish which were baked to within an inch of their life  To our surprise We had thin pesto pizza for a starter As it was not clear on the menu that it was an actual pizza but nevertheless I will say it tasted nice I had apple crumble for dessert  I can only say that it was like eating melted brown sugar with stewed apples  It was horrifyingly sweet and I have a sweet tooth It made me feel like I needed a trip to my dentist the next day I m going to sum up by saying The customer service was beyond poor We were made to feel most unwelcome and the food was not of any high restaurant quality that I am used to  Our experience at this restaurant was disappointing to say the least and one that we shall never repeat For this unpleasant experience we were charged 65 00 It s sad that establishments think it s okay to treat customers this way and then further insult you by charging you for it Not a pleasant experience  
negative,After many many visits to Cicchetti over the years almost always for breakfast today counted as amongst both the worse breakfasts and worst eating experiences I have ever had The place was substantially empty on arrival and we were shown to what was simply the nearest table When I asked to move the request was granted in a graceless manner to another table  Orders placed two drinks two breakfasts one the traditional breakfast one Eggs Benedict Drinks arrived separately 5 minutes apart Cold food arrived after another 20 minutes or so on two cold plates The Benedict was tasteless and inadequate The muffins whilst toasted were cold and not buttered Inexplicably there was rocket on the plate but no wedge of lemon The eggs were pale and if they were free range I will eat hay with a donkey  The cooked breakfast had amongst its treasures a tablespoon- worth of cheap baked beans make your own San Carlo  which were stone cold as was the toast The waitress disagreed with me as to the warmth of the plate but then whipped the whole thing away Another 20 minutes later a red hot plate reappeared with a pair of pale bone dry half- eggs though I was fortunate to have half of someone else s broken yolk mixed in  Mushrooms were slimy and overcooked The was a burnt half garden tomato and a dried hash- brown of the type that Farmfoods sell I did not even attempt to eat it especially as my friend s breakfast had been eaten an age before mine reappeared Oh and they forgot the toast again and when that arrived it was pale cold and underdone  Manager did not arrive so after 5 minutes went to find him chatting up a table of ladies At no point did he look at my plate Or ask what he could do to put it right Instead  2 80 representing a cup of tea was knocked off the bill Eventually the breakfast I didn t eat was knocked off but still the bill was over 20 for a truly dismal experience  Where is the potato blini the marjoram- seasoned beef tomato and home- made rosti of old I m no restaurateur but I d get a chef who cares and can keep food hot  some new staff and please please stop cutting costs Until then the poor reviews will keep coming and the loyal customers won t 
negative, A pub on the edge of Borough Market We visited for a drink and the bar staff seemed to think they were doing us a favour by serving us That and they didn t even know what beers they were serving we had to point out which pumps they should use  Then I dared to take a photo of us in the pub Oooops - the big burly bouncer came over and told me I wasn t allowed to use my camera His manner was very aggressive but I had to point out that they had CCTV which was taking everyones photo Wrong move - he went into some tirade about security issues and god knows what so we drank up and left  There is no shortage of nice bars nearby so don t bother going to this pretentious and precious place 
negative, This place should be one of the areas busiest pubs attractions a great position fantastic views set in a beautiful area from there it goes down hill Locals give the place a very wide birth as it s reputation preceeds it The staff and management are so un professional and service is so slow if your lucky to eventually get served What should be the brewery crown jewel it s a complete farce It s so sad to see something with much potential being run down and wasted the food is also very poor Do yourself a favour give it a wide birth better places nearby 
negative,Yesterday evening me and my 2 children went to the Chinese Buffet It didn t appear that busy We asked for a table for 3 upon entry We were asked to sit and wait in the seating area by the bar At least 3 more parties of people arrived after us and they all were asked to wait for a table unfortunately all the other parties were then taken to various tables before me and my children when I asked the man who appeared to be sorting the tables out why we appeared to be invisible he offered no explanation I then left the Restaurant and when round the corner to  Nandos were the service and food were excellent 
negative, I am actually sat in this establishment as I type There are dirty glasses and plates piled high both behind an actually on the bar the place is littered through out with empty plates of food and glasses  some plates at our bench table have been there for 45 minutes  there are unwiped tables throughout some of which are heavily soiled Service was also pathetically slow 10 minutes to order a bottle of wine and two glasses  my ordering was twice interrupted whilst the bartender took calls AVOID  
negative,We went with friends having heard some good reports The Inn is very attractive but for us that s where it stopped It took an hour and a half for our food to arrive and when it did it could only rate as OK and nothing special We dared not risk ordering a dessert But what made it worse was the lack of management which at best was patronising there was no explanation or apology and when we asked we were told it will be 5 or 15 minutes but in fact was very much longer We were only given some complimentary bread and olives when we started to complain and eventually a complimentary bottle of wine By now it was too late to go anywhere else and we were hungry otherwise we would have left Let s hope this was an exception but it s unlikely we ll go again or recommend it 
negative, Did not enjoy the food atmosphere whole experience was poor this place is going the same way as the one in the town centre same owners I recall food was not hot and of a average standard at best bit like a school canteen miserable staff so overall will not go again 
negative, The place could do with some t l c and a good scrub the managers never seem to stay long enough to get to know and the floor is uneven so take care if not steady on your feet the toilets are smelly and the tables are dirty knot sure if food is sold but it does give advertisements to say they do all though I have not seen anyone eating here 
negative, We went to Oblix for a Sunday lunch and were left waiting on the side while the hostess seated everyone behind us first The stampede that came out of the elevator had varied lunch time reservations some of which were 45 mins after ours but she still dealt with them first We were then seated far from any view and the service was even worse than I had heard it would be The starters were fine but the tenderloin was tough and not worth it s price Very expensive and extremely noisy Impossible to hear anyone talk I WILL NEVER GO BACK 
negative,An extremely unhelpful staff My local Weatherspoons Elk in Poulton staff have a completely different mind set I was with a large group of friends who thought the same In fact I m still waiting on my breakfast which never arrived
negative, Im a level 3 in travel and tourism and I orderd a chicken tikka dhansak when it came I had one bight and spat it back out The chicken korma was also the same All the other family members liked theres but was not happy when they tried both the chicken dishes The staff looked like they was is a rush and was very pushy There was not even an apology from staff and only knocked the korma off the bill I eat currys all the time and this was by far the worst but i got told from a family member that the lamb was the best they had All the starters were great but who serves raw food Would richard branson be happy 
negative, Looks good from the outside that s it Half empty containers 4 small pieces of chicken in my dish but the icing on the cake was when I pulled a piece of naan from the bag only to chew on hair I took it back and upon examination by the owner I was was told it was a ladies hair  and it didn t come from them no apology no offer of any form  not that I would have accepted should have bought a tesco take away that says it all 
negative, Arrived on New Years Eve afternoon with 5 friends and my 5 year old son Walked Into main area where there were lots of large EMPTY tables The host ordered us to move to the family area as we had a child  I really don t like this area it s dirty dark and grotty at the best of times but we went to find a table  Immediately we found no tables free so we walked though to the QUIET area and found a table  The very rude and sharp waitress barked  no kids allowed you need to move to the family area no kids in this side allowed  We told her this was full so she told us either to wait 30 mins no idea where as no kids allowed  We were astounded that as there were lots of free tables they were happy to loose our custom Apparently it s company policy not to allow children in any area other than the family side  SHOCK  This is astonishing in a time where everywhere in the media it is becoming more apparent that discrimination actually exists in 2017 we found ourselves being discriminated as we had a child present in our group Why on earth should I be made to wait 30 mins or have to leave just because this is the ONLY place we are allowed to sit when there was plenty of vacant tables available I am genuinely appalled at this Subsequently they have now lost custom from 6 people who will discuss this in every friendship and family group to ensure the message gets around asap  Letter is on its was to HQ about this disgraceful policy and the arrogant lady who was very happy to see us leave through the door passing at least 5 empty tables  Regardless whether you are a parent of a child under 12 or not no one should be discriminated against in this day and age We would not ever chose to sit in the horrible children s area so why be made to or have the only option to leave  My family had visited here a number of times and on our last occasion we had 5 children with us and we all sat on the out of bounds area  so your process is inconstant  Never returning - you should be ashamed of yourselves Disgraced  
negative, Travelled to this chippy due to good reviews I have to say they were awful Batter on the fish was not cooked properly thick yellow slop inside on the fish Fish not filleted properly bones in my fish I understand that s the suppliers fault though chips some cooked some raw with green bits and eyes on still My dinner went in the bin And so my hunt for a decent chippy in Huddersfield starts again 
negative, Don t bring your sandwiches here It s certainly no picnic visiting Lord Sandwich s stately pile at Mapperton His ancestor may have liked to bring his own grub but don t you try it No picnic places and if you try to eat at the outdoor÷ having bought a drink a lady comes out and shouts at you  get out leave now I ll give you your money back for the drinks and get out now After that welcome remember not to feed the birds and don t go using his lordship s croquet set either unless you have permission The garden is pretty enough except for the two foul sticking old swimming pools full of green brackish water- perhaps that s where you are thrown if you use the croquet set without permission We would have liked afternoon tea but when m lord and lady nip into the Ritz they can pay with their credit card but not here So off to Bridport for some fresh air in more senses than one   
negative, We have given them 3 chances awful rib sauce on one the worse salt beef sandwich on two and just plain arrogant and poor service from management on three Opening a restaurant doesn t mean you know how to run one 
negative, I don t usually post poor reviews but I think in this case I must we are staying at the premier inn and booked breakfast as we usually do as in the pasted we have had nothing but good food and service but this one was totally rubbish the young lad who was cooking the food was out of his depth as it was very busy and he was on his own this meant he cooked the sausage and bacon but ran out of eggs and tomatoes by the time these were cooked he had run out of bacon and sausage again this became an unending cycle for the poor lad we complained to the duty manager who s attitude was if you have a problem tell the premier inn which we did and to their plays gave us a complete refund This is the first time we have had a problem so won t stop us using these establishments but won t be having breakfast at this one again 
negative, Went to Owd Nells on Sunday for lunch and have been before on many occasions The reservation system in place is diabolical and quite frankly not customer friendly My partner and I walked around the place looking for a table without reservations put upon them but alas this could not be found Eventually a girl strolled up which we took to imply she was in charge of the reservations and the 3 parties behind us got seen to before us and seated immediately they hadn t already made a reservation  When we enquired about a table for two we were told there would be at least a 10 minute wait which I was fairly surprised at considering the amount of tables that were empty and the reservation list containing a small amount of names I can t seem to find a reason why she would make it up or what would motivate her to resist seating us but something was definitely off I decided that I wasn t waiting around pointlessly and it was clear she didn t want our custom so we went elsewhere I will repeat that I m not sure what the motivation was or the reason behind the girls decision but I didn t appreciate it in the slightest and this needs looking at We will not return to Owd Nells which is a real shame as we have been around once a week for the last 15 years that s a lot by the way  and this is the first time we have felt this way Fortunately for Owd Nells they will always continue to be busy and will not need two peoples custom to exist I just felt I had to write this review to convey my dismay and disappointment in Owd Nells even though not a blind bit if notice will be taken by them Oh well Preston and surrounding areas better start improving their eateries now this place is off the radar 
negative, Today we waited an hour then yuk the breakfast tasted awful bacon looked & tasted raw offered us a free coffee which was nearly full of frothy milk that needed spooning out the last half We ve been here several times in the past & cant remember it being like this as it been taken over  
negative, My family and I visited for my daughters birthday  My son in law were the only members of the party to choose steak and we were both violently ill with food poisoning for two days afterwards  This meal was the only common denominator and I don t believe in coincidence  Dine there at your peril 
negative, We called in for lunch 3 tables had customers sitting at them so we chose a window seat We ordered our drinks whilst waiting for a table to be cleared 25 minutes later they had not cleared a single table  The member of staff that bought our drinks even pushed the dirty plates across one of the tables in order to put the tray down to serve our order from the whole time we were there not one table was cleared of left over food or drinks  There reply to the table issue was they were very busy LOL The place is cluttered with to much stuff it would not be so bad if they move it and cleaned and removed the cobwebs there are a lot nicer placeS to frequent in street with better service 
negative, I would have loved to review this restaurant however they claimed not to have a booking in our name I found the staff unhelpful and obviously rushed off their feet during the short time that we were there In a way I was glad that we had to go elsewhere as this restaurant appeared cramped an claustrophobic I have no doubt that the service would have been as poor as described by other reviewers in the end we went to the Wall Heath Tandoori and had a great time I shan t be bothering with Zendis again 
negative, Before I start I realise that it s not the Ritz  but the food has to be a certain standard Family meal surroundings are great pub is great Food shocking  ordered Sea bass fillet with asparagus peas and buttered new potatoes Fish was cold and like rubber peas mixed with asparagus stalks clearly frozen mixed veg  microwaved grey potatoes with no butter YUK Daughter had chicken Kiev burnt with no muddle father had burnt chicken Breast Seriously poor Hadn t been here for 3 years because food was bad however it s worse than ever premier inn please take notice and sort it out  
negative, I attended here for a quiet drink after work and the toliets were dirty and they stunk The tables are sticky and grubby Their attitudes towards customers is horrendus and the service was awful instead of them saying hello how may i help you They just asked what do you want  Was accused of having too much to drink even though they could understand what i was saying not being rude or lary or paraletic which was not possible because i just finished work  probarly because they wanted to close early  probarly the most rude and depressing place i been to and the food is not great either will not be setting foot in that place again and i will not be reccomending this place to others either   
negative, The service was very slow meal very disappointing small and over microwaved vegetables were cold We waited to order a desert but were not asked if we wanted one so paid bill and left No excuse as the place was virtually empty This is the second bad experience at lunch time although a visit in the evening was much better Food overpriced for what you get We will not be visiting again for some time 
negative, Yes that s right I think you would be better off going across the road and using the vending machine in the visitor centre A vending machine would give better levels of customer service than at the Gatehouse The food would also be nicer Oh and it would be cheaper too  Needless to say I m not a big fan of this place The service food and prices are all terrible I would recommend either of the Vesper Gate or more preferably the West End House You will get a much better meal or drinks there  Oh the building is gorgeous mind you 
negative, Waited at please wait here sign to be seated no staff to be seen restaurant and bar only had small amount of customers after ten minutes we seated ourselves at table after about ten more minutes member of staff took our orders only about four couples in restaurant at time thia curry was nice then waited at less another ten minutes after finishing dinner for dessert menu and order the at less a good hour after for dessert to arrive manager look clueless spent time walking up and down with laptop in hand  Recommend they employ more staff even heard chef shout service four times for staff to take food to tables first and last time going to this place  
negative, Landlord is a nutter and the place is a hovel Even before we got in the pub the Landlord kicked off in the car park Tried to scam us saying we hit a customers car Turns out the beaten up shed of a car belonged to the so called chef We nearly had to call the police Beware    
negative, I had been here for dimsum before and it was pretty decent So I thought I would come here with my girlfriend for dinner one night Oh my god what a mistake The black pepper beef we ordered was slathered in some non-descript brown sauce like the stuff you get with a 5 quid steak at the pub  the steamed greens we ordered were overcooked to a mushy consistency and the aubergine with pork claypot was so flavourless that we had to ask for some soy sauce and vinegar just to bring it up to a palatable state To add insult to injury The bill - each dish averaged over 10 quid which would have been wholly justified if it was a decent meal But it wasn t My verdict stick with the dimsum and avoid the main courses at all cost 
negative, Tried to phone and book a table for my wife s birthday I tried phoning for 4 days and no one answered so I drove to the restaurant and found that the place is in darkness Shame because the food was good 
negative, Really looking forward to a nice Sunday lunch decided to go to the star in Leighton buzzard big mistake kept waiting from the off landlady very unwelcoming waiter very stressed starters were fine got one starter which were for another table so waited 5 mins for other starters to arrive when the mains arrived 3 x roasts with no Yorkies when asked the server said they were busy and no more were made I fancied a nice steak and ale pie homemade was just a pie mix with a puff pastry lid so clearly not homemade bland dry and cooked in bisto waited 40mins for mains they pride themselves on home made roasts being a chef I ve never ever tasted anything like it shockng complained to the waiter and he said that if we have a problem take it up with the owner very bad also swore at our table under his breath For me this is the worst pub to eat in Leighton buzzard shocking  when we asked to speak to the manager she said im busy and clearly didn t want to speak to me - 
negative, Had to visit Reigate on business and checked to see which restaurants close by would be worthy of a visit for lunch According to the Gey Rhino website they re open for lunch We arrived to see the menu displayed externally and confirmation of opening hours We entered the front door but at the top of the staircase the door to the restaurant was locked OK maybe closed due to some emergency these things happen But we phoned to check and we were told they re only open in the evening Some people are in business in spite of themselves Luckily Reigate has plenty of eateries who can be bothered to open for lunch in accordance with published times 
negative,Having traveled all over the country i can honestly say this chip shop wins FIRST PRIZE for the worst food we have ever eaten The fish must have been caught by captain noah in the good ship ark The chips were just as bad and the mushy peas just a green glowing lump that struggled to slide out of he pot The 4 meals we purchased were totally uneatable The price was so expensive to at close to 30 00 The person behind the counter got part of the order wrong which is hard to do when we said fish chips and peas x4 please The whole place was dirty and dated I would rather starve than visit again With the right people and a lick of paint this could be a credit to the good people of mundsley 
negative,Second time at this place first wasn t marvelous so gave it a second chance as it was late Tandoori chicken flavourless not been marinated very long and was bland Next was a biryani greasy and again lacking any depth of spice The curry sauce that came with icing be described as a sauce more like big chunks I ve vegetable all dente coated in a bland sauce  Won t be going back for a third attempt very disappointing it s probably the worse indian meal I have had ever Just makes you angry 
negative, Just normal coffee which is overpriced when taken with biscuits or cake   Always a long wait to get served in all Costa s not just Bridgnorth Staff always overworked Think they should have more staff on 
negative,Starters Tuna Carpaccio - tasteless A carpaccio means thinly sliced these were medallions Wild Mushroom - tasteless How do you remove the flavour We could only speculate how the flavour had gone missing Main Course Fish Grill - we sent this back as the fish was not cooked which they accepted Calves Liver - overcooked and soggy vegetables We order a desert but cancelled it We lost patience when we ordered sweet wine and it was delivered in 50ml glasses The standard serving for sweet wine is 125ml or 150ml and they argued We live in a big city Milton Keynes and eat our regularly here and in London We gave allowance that this is a tiny town of just 3 000 people with its own dining microclimate but we were left with the feeling that these guys simply did not know what they were doing They were completely out of their depth charging top prices for a menu they do not have the competence deliver on  Looking back we should have seen the signs The whole place is run down untidy amateurish and full of half finished DIY jobs The waiters were shambolic untrained monosyllabic scruffy with no €÷lan or polish  The next evening we ate Antonio s Trattoria round the corner and were delighted
negative,Awful food and awful service Waited an hour for a takeaway  The food was really bland and boring The Singapore Vermicelli was the worst part It was gloopy flavourless and tasted artificial Don t waste your time or your money here 
negative, I had read some reviews about the service but thought I would try it the food was nice once we got it but the service was very poor After arriving we waited 20 mins and know one came to order drinks so had to find a member of staff  eventually they came  then waited a long time until they took order again had to find a member of staff and again for another round of drinks  then hot plates came out to our table but food followed 15 mins later so the plates were cold  Not enough staff and will not be returning 
negative, Hot sticky smelly and staff need retraining they give the impression of being grossly under staffed or running on a tight budget and could not care less whether the customer is taken care of or not take it or leave it attitude 
negative,Firstly let me say the staff are excellent and always friendly so no complaint there That s the good news The bad news is that being owned by Marstons but leased from Scottish and Newcastle or what ever they are called now means that it is in a permanent state of disrepair the toilets are out of the dark ages always smelly with wet floors and a permanent yellow warning sign soap dispensers with no soap and in the wrong place In the summer there are never enough staff when the garden gets busy and for reasons only known to themselves they claim it is price but don t believe that for a minute they seem to stock all the wrong real ales with none of the favourites Doombar London Pride Good Old Boy etc and a load of mediocre ones instead With a bit of investment and good management this could be a great pub with a brilliant location near houses the canal the railway station and industrial units but till they do it is at best mediocre at worst a missed opportunity by its owners 
negative, I love Groupon because it allows you to discover places that you ve never heard of or been to Sometimes you discover little gems to which I d happily advertise to friends and family But then there are other times when you find a shocker like Chi bar  It was bad from the word go My girlfriend and I walked in nothing to say please wait to be seated  So we waited and waited some more No staff to greet us So we wondered to the back where the bar was and asked to be seated It was a while before we were given any menus to look at You get a glass of prosecco or a soft drink alternative with this groupon the waiter brought prosecco to us without even asking if we wanted soft drink or prosecco I was driving so I couldn t drink The waiter was awful didn t say a word just plonked the glasses in front of us  The waitress was new so we could forgive her for being a little slow taking the orders I had asked her to double check the groupon details to check what was included  The starters arrived quite quickly to be fair I had chicken wings which were a little greasy but my girlfriend s onion bahjee was good The mains took a while to arrive and tasted average The naan was a little burnt and the chips a bit soggy But still permissible - see how lenient I am The waiter did not impress though Not professional at all black shirt with shiny black jeans and trainers He barely spoke to us only asking us who had what when delivering the food He didn t ask if we had finished our meal just took glasses and plates away without a word  No sooner had we finished the manager asked if we wanted the bill and if we didn t mind  could we pay quickly and leave  I can understand they re busy but how utterly rude to take your water away before you ve finished  I have no problem paying for what I owe but when I asked the waitress what was included in the groupon she d said a starter main and side each The bill charged us for drinks as expected and sides I enquired about the sides and the manager immediately took it as a personal attack All I was after was that the manager made sure his staff knew the terms and conditions of what offer they were running instead he initiated an argument at the table He tried to blame me for not reading the groupon properly - I knew what was included but wanted to make sure because with past groupons the restaurant may add to the offer But all this restaurant had to add was rudeness and poor service  I can safely say I ll never be eating drinking or even mentioning this place again unless it is a warning to stay away  
negative, Had take away from there and food was terrible Lamb tikka was gristle poppadom was not crisp and the curry was griany in texture with very little meat with far too much salt Had severe stomach cramps after and would have been sent back if given that in restaurant 
negative, + good shami kebab starter + great lassi - cramped - noisy - bad curry - terrible service Had to order everything twice as it didn t arrive first time twice  Night ended in argument with waiter manager 
negative, Landlady I presume as an employee wouldn t be so rude couldn t have cared less that we waited 40 mins for food There were onl a couple of tables eating before us so I don t understand it No apology no I m sorry let me see how long it will be  Just it s nearly ready and you will have to pay if you leave  We had to go paid for drinks and had to leave Still no apology 
negative, The waitress brought a 4 bottle of water instead of the tab water we ordered At the end of the dinner she didn t give us the full change back keeping 3   All this on the top of a 20 service fee that was non-advertised on the menu 30 for 2 basic vegetarian pizza and a bottle of water we never ordered  Way too expensive for very ordinary food  I ll never go there again 
negative, I don t know what it s like to eat here but a number of times I have gone in for a pint because it s so pretty and in such a nice spot - and every time until now I have forgotten how TERRIBLE it is  Normal service = 5 people behind the bar and only 1 of them serving Not unusual to have a 15 minute wait to be served when there are only a few customers Staff rarely seem to know what they are doing and always seem in a flap The beer is horribly overpriced and the atmosphere is awful  AVOID AT ALL COSTS  If you want a great pub in the area go to the Parcel Yard in KX Station instead 
negative, Was served dry tasteless donuts that were at least a couple of days old and when complained received the worst customer service ever 
negative, This wetherspoons has gone seriously downhill recently There appears to be new management and with it has come a severe drop in quality and service  We visited as a party of 10 for a birthday celebration Upon first attempting to order we found that most of the meals were unavailable at 6 00 on a thursday night The pub was out of mixed grills most curries beef burgers and chicken burgers Disappointed we changed most of the orders and waited another 10 mins to be served again We were then told that there was no hot dogs which most of our orders had been changed to We ultimately gave up and ordered whatever was available  The staff member serving us was rude and appeared to have no idea what she was doing She couldn t operate the machine properly appeared grumpy when we ordered 9 meals and asked us what the hell is that when we ordered a specific drink She also gave us no receipt when requested and gave us diet coke when we asked for full fat By the time we had successfully ordered one member of our party had to leave due to other commitments because it had taken 1 and a half hours for the pub to sort out our orders Honestly the service was appalling  The food arrived relatively quickly but wasn t ideal quality The orders arrived over around 15 minutes so we were unable to eat together and some of the food such as the gammon was cold Most of the food was good value though and the servings were large  However when ordering ice cream sundaes for dessert we were again told they had none and we basically just gave up and left The pub appeared to have stock of virtually nothing which never used to be an issue in the past  A birthday meal was ruined by the poor quality If you eat here don t expect to get your first order option they probably won t have it It s also worth pointing out that there was broken glass under our table which had clearly been left and surely was a safety hazard Don t eat here go to Staindrop Lodge instead the food is significantly better and not significantly more expensive 
negative, I used to be a regular customer at Royal China however a sharp decline in the quality of the food and an apparent increase in prices mean I will be going elsewhere from now on  Over my past couple of visits a number of dishes have been very disappointing In the case of the Chinese broccoli and the crispy beef the food has actually been inedible In the case of the former it was covered in a disgusting cold gelatinous gloop In the case of the latter it was cloyingly sweet  Further disappointments have included the quarter crispy duck The amount of meat you get has been steadily decreasing to the extent that the last time I was there we managed to get a meagre four rolls out of the quantity served The quality of the meat in the sweet and sour pork has really declined too and it is hit and miss as to whether you are going to get a mouthful of meat or cartilage  Being creatures of habit my partner and I often order the same dishes at Royal China Over the last couple of months the bill has steadily increased from around 80 pounds for two to 106 on our latest visit We ordered less beer than usual too And only ate around 50 of the food as the rest was horrible  Royal China used to be one of our favourite London restaurants but we will not be returning 
negative, I ve just been to the Lister arms with a few of my family We were sat in the beautiful beer garden when all of a sudden Bang The back kitchen door swings open and a vile spew of words fell out of this chefs mouth He then went over to some other customers and accused them of giggling at him Which they weren t to which more swear words were shouted at the customers by him Needless to say we swiftly left with a sour taste in all our mouths Needless to say that will be the very last time I go 
negative, Confronted by barmaid in aggressive manner stating kids can inky come in if they have a full main meal which we fully intended to do Fairly full so asked if there were other seats Dismissive answer led to us leaving and going to the lowther next door which is fantastic 
negative,Driving to London on the 22nd December we had the misfortune to stop at the Roadchef Taunton Deane services on the M5 northbound I should have been alerted by the fact that the restaurant was almost completely de stocked and desolate I would not have been surprised to see tumbleweed rolling down the aisles  I ordered ham egg and chips and when it arrived the eggs were off Pure sulphurous stink bombs how the cook didn t notice is beyond credence  Whilst I was insisting on my money back another gentleman arrived returning his fish and chips  In the pantheon of lousy motorway service areas of which there are many the Roadchef Taunton Deane really is close to the bottom the pits  It just shows if you have a captive market you can get away with murder With real competition this place would have been out of business long ago 
negative, Me and my other half have been here 3 times and 2 out of the 3 it has been terrible The first time was lovely great service nice food The Second time - we arrived there on a hot day in March not very busy but the upstairs terrace was open We was seated and left ten minuted without an order being taken after waveing someone over we ordered our drinks my other half ordered vodka and coke Weak and i ordered the cider My drink had arrived and i was given the BEER i questioned the waitress stating it was not cider and she looked at it and said this is the house cider i asked to change it for coke and she came out with a cider I tried to explain what had happened to the supervisor and he didnt seem to understand what i was talking about took ages for a payment and food We could hear and see plenty of people complaining  The third time - We arrived late afternoon the resteraunt was not busy at all We was seated and had to wait again to even get menus we had a loyalty card to get a free starter but this was added on the bill I ordered the stromboli calzone and was given the wrong one my other halfs lasagne didnt look to great either I tried to call someone over but the supervisor was seen socializing with the staff on many occassions and noone seemed that interested in the customers really  I would try a different Zizzi resteraunt but avoid this one at all costs 
negative, Bad service Out for a friend s birthday Relatively quiet had one non alcoholic cocktail driving  which was ok Went back for another I ordered one drink waiter then took another persons order just after mine then he got mixing 10 minutes later of him shaking and pouring with me stood by myself at the bar and he hadn t even started making mine He looked a bit sheepish when I asked where it was and said he was about to start it  I told him not bother and walked out Not coming back 
negative,Ate at Sir dukes with a work colleague earlier this week Ordered the Ribs to start which were full of Grissle and tastless followed by the chicken Burger which was undercooked Don t bother wasting your time or money
negative,A pub I have often frequented but today was my first time eating here I went in for lunch and I can safely that this is the worst food I have eaten in Norwich and I have eaten out in Norwich a lot  I had a roast dinner which was poorly cooked and tasteless Just really really bad Great place to go for a drink but avoid if you are hungry 
negative,My wife and I visited Caf€÷ Rouge Mail Box Birmingham in January and had an excellent meal with excellent service  Whilst in Leamington we decided to eat in Caf€÷ Rouge with our daughter and grand daughter aged 4 It was to be a meal for my birthday Arrived about 11 55 am Drink order taken by a very polite gentleman Drinks arrived about 15 minutes later No problem so far About 12 30pm I had to ask for someone to take our food order and the same gentleman apologised and took the order WE waited and waited and waited I asked about our food order about 13 05 and was told it would be about 5 more minutes 13 20 it still hadn t arrived so I asked to pay for the drinks and left The food in Leamington Not a clue except diners arriving much later than us received their food The service Appalling It is the first time in my life I have ever walked out of a restaurant because of the lack of service or any other reason 
negative, This is a takeaway cafe style restaurant in the newly revamped Birmingham new street station I visited on 7 10 15 and ordered the chicken burrito at 6 79 This is the worst fast food I have had in the UK in 20 years The burrito was full of undercooked rice and tasteless chicken It did not taste fresh and I am quite worried that it will make me ill I wouldn t even recommend this above a microwave bacon sandwich if you are hungry Get a chocolate bar instead Avoid this place Do not support these crap chain establishments who think it is OK to charge huge mark ups for food which is far below par It is not expensive to make a tasty burrito 
negative, Very overpriced got a takeaway for a corporate event and feel we were overcharged food was not that good 
negative, Its such a shame to see what was once a great take away produce such a poor meal I went there on a Wednesday evening and ordered sesame prawn toast crispy duck butterfly prawns ginger beef chicken with cashews noodles and rice Really hungry I went home opened the boxes and was treated to a mass of uninviting brown tasteless food soaked in oil It was quite possibly the worst takeaway I have even had the misfortune to have 
negative,Cant comment on food after waiting nearly 2 hours gave up and went home Very disappointed as went for new year meal
negative,I recently stopped by this astonishing-located restaurant while hiking Me and my girlfriend sat outside to enjoy the views and ordered a coffee and a tea The service was quick but on arrival we noticed that the mug for the tea was dirty Not a bit dirty it was filthy One would expect certain levels of cleanliness from a place like this specially at that price Without making too much fuss we asked one of the waitresses if we could get a new mug to which she replied  you can go to the bar  We did after queing to get a new mug  an even filthier mug was given to us by a bar tender that looked as if I was insulting him by asking for a clean mug  As we wanted to get on with the walk we started having our drinks only to find that the milk jug had bits of what looked like parsley or some other herbs floating and stuck to it In summary a very low standard for such a great located place 
negative,We had a table booked for 11 people and two babies which I would have thought would warrent some special attention given a such a large group but we were squeezed into a booth which would accommodate 6 people only so we ate with elbows in Ignored in terms of menu provision They offered Sunday lunch but when we ordered at 13 30 there was no beef left Poor food quality and portion size one sprig of broccoli  Took an age to come Didn t offer deserts and when we ordered coffee they told us they had run out of beans  A great little drinking pub or light snacks for sure but don t go expecing a decent Sunday lunch with a large group  Oh and the toilets are disgusting even my two-year-old boy said it smelled like piggies 
negative,After waiting for so long for the shop to open after it was closed with no explanation plus putting up with poor service once it was open I can now report a new low As I was walking into the shop tonight notice the time of this post and I have returned home since the lights were turned off I told them all I wanted was a lamb wrap I was basically told to feck off as the shop was closed I WILL NOW DEVOTE MY LIFE TO TELLING EVERY ONE ABOUT THIS ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE ACT Bens you suck 
negative, Ordered here after a week away thinking I could have a nice evening with a bottle of wine with my partner some shredded duck and a glorious mixed hors d oeuvers for 2 After receiving an email to say it would be delayed I assumed the best they must be busy I was very wrong   The food turned up barely warm and upon inspection the duck was not freshly shredded but carved from what I can only describe as a neatly sliced microwave meal It was most certainly not a quarter duck  When I called to complain something which I hate to do they asked if I would like a discount off my next order when I explained I didn t want to order again they said they would resend the order but it would take 30 - 45 minutes and that the driver found our house very difficult to find   something a taxi driver never has GPS is a wonderous new device and I am still awaiting the resend - hopefully not before I decide to go to bed Honestly I am sure this is a wonderful Chinese if you live close and expect a cheap variant to what most class as a normal takeaway I won t be ordering again best of luck to those that do and hopefully this is a one off as the reviews did seem good hence my order initially 
negative, So we three all arrived with great anticipation at the nicely presented pub clean and with a pleasant atmosphere we perused the menu and salivated over the good choice of dishes to be had We had starters my nachos were plentiful and very nicely presented at over 5 they should be eh potato skins were the preferred choice of another nicely presented but two smallish specimens had been cut in half to give four small strips again about 5 next was crab-cakes I can feel you drooling already but just two about the diameter of a 50p piece and about an inch thick tasted like fish-cake not crab-cake at nearly 6 how could they serve just two All very colourful but very very poor value for money We had our mains to come great as the half spit-roast peri-peri chicken 10 95 had leapt out at me from the menu that was for me slurp It arrived in all it s glory very nicely presented and with a colourful salad garnish it looked good But wait what s this any half chicken I d ever encountered before had one leg one wing one breast one of just about everything I guess Not this poor creature it had no breast it was a quarter chicken not a half as advertised on the menu and with hardly any edible meat on it the poor creature had obviously died of starvation I complained but was fobbed off no sign of boss or chef The ham egg and chip was 7 95 two eggs 1 bit of ham and a handful of chips the carbonara about 9 had this gloopy uncooked egg-white stuff floating about in it Chef obviously carves out every penny of profit to be had with no thought given to value for money and repeat business I felt as if I had just been mugged I said I didn t expect to pay for the chicken but was told I had to Had I been on my own I would have refused and waited for the chicken police to arrive but with company didn t want to make more of a scene I suggest you do not waste your hard earned cash here go to a Harvester or Beefeater instead I will never eat here again and highly recommend that you don t either This my first ever bad review given for a pub restaurant 
negative,Travel all the way into Norwich for a York Tavern roast dinner only to be told that due to some sub-par music being played in the garden it s BBQ only today  7 for a cheeseburger is just ridiculous and to be told that the main menu isn t being served today is just a joke  What a huge disappointment they couldn t even provide ketchup with the burger and surprise surprise nobody is buying food today   Why    Because you re ripping people off  Shame on you We won t be coming back ever 
negative,The food was very poor and the staff extremely rude On the other hand they were rushing us to eat quickly after 15min seating on the table just to free up the table The worst of it is that the food and drinks were quite quite expensive Honestly not recommend 
negative,I booked a romentic Valentines meal nice and early on 18th January which isn t like me I needed t amend te time so called on 13th February only t be told they d lost my booking and they were now full  I am only glad needed t change the time now I can eat in a more professional restaurant 
negative, We have had fish and chips from here in the past but I have to say this year we were very disappointed we phoned order through as there were 8 of us but food was poor quality and cold Need to get back to usual standard 
negative, Waited an hour for dreadful food the vegetation option my wife and I ordered was inedible Toilets filthily 
negative, This place has high aspirations but fails completely because the service is so incredibly inept and rude We had a group of nine people in for which we had pre-booked  and when we arrived the place was empty So you d think they d be falling all over themselves to treat us well Instead we were treated with poorly concealed contempt clearly we were too much bother  Such a shame because the food was quite good But we won t EVER go back When asked at the end of the night what we thought our response was clearly not taken on board But we were happy to hear a voice behind us say that they agreed about the service We are not alone in thinking they need to learn a lot about customer service as I ve read several other reviews that offer the same feedback There are MANY other places to go in Forest Hill and we ll definitely be taking our business elsewhere They are a complete embarassment to the area 
negative, This has to be the worst restaurant in Gravesend Food was bland drinks overpriced and to top it all off they have just been given a ZERO Food Hygiene Rating   Makes me feel sick just thinking about how dirty and unhygienic this place must be    
negative, The food here is very average however the wait for the food was appalling and the beer was overpriced and warm Would not recommend 
negative, Nice little place but unfortunatley the food could not live up to its surroundings I opted for a burger which was served in a bap that had been either over microved to defrost quickly or had been in the freezer too long and become freezer burnt As for my wifes meal well she chose a mackeral dish that was served on new potatoes swimming in oil We mentioned this to the waitress and she spoke to the chef he came back with Mackeral is an oily fish Brilliant Better excuses needed your guest are not that poorly educated On a slighty more positive note we did have 2 free coffees and the waitress was very pleasent Its a real shame because the venue is well located and gets quite busy 
negative, I ve never previously had cause to write a review albeit good or bad on here or other sites but the experience of this establishment has prompted me to do so  I m totally astounded by some of the earlier rave reviews - can only assume that they are locals   regulars as the service myself and friends received was dire  I can see from a couple of reviews yesterday that another out of town party parties received similar treatment so I m wondering if the staff have a problem with outsiders   The Barman & the waitress were both incredibly offhand unfriendly and inefficient right from the off  The cost of the drinks were incredibly high but even though we were a tad shocked by the total we still opted to eat in as there didn t appear to be many alternatives nearby  Although the restaurant was empty we were not allowed to sit where we wanted no idea why as no tables were booked and querying it we were just met with stony silence from the waitress  The menu was sparse and a tad pricey Alas most of my friends and I made the huge error of ordering sandwiches which when they arrived were little more than x2 pieces of dry stale bread with barely any filling - not even margarine or butter For these they were charging between 5 - 6 Incredible  Some of the other options appeared better quality  value for money so have no idea why the sandwich options are quite so poor 
negative, Step inside turn look at the dirty filthy door mat Speaks volumes Something not quite right here Delayed service Bread ordinary days old and frozen instead of fresh crusty  Soggy batter cold plates dishes dried out under hot cold plates Waited over an hour for dish which takes less than 5 minutes to cook Then to cap it all spoken too as if you are an imbecile So sad as I am a supporter of loch fine Another example of the british don t give a dam attitude - serve them owt who cares Thanks for a very bad expensive experience 
negative,I went there on Sunday lunch we were 4 of us and we wait the first 10 minutes to order some water Then they explain the different cut of meat and took other 15 minutes  Two waiter and one manager obesely they were short of staff so I been quiet   We order the wine and this as well took like 20 minutes   Then I saw the waiter always close to one table of 8 people and the reception told us that they pay the service charge so she must to give the best time   That s shocking  I tip good and then this is the company policy to don t look after the guest because they don t pay the service I don t mind to pay service and tip as well   In the end we order petit fours and the manager forgot to order   So another manager to apologies send us two plates that we didn t eat in the end    Manager talking and waiter struggling to take order and reset the table    Hope someone will get back to me   
negative, After being shown to the coldest table in the restaurant being told that was the only table for 2 avalible whilst tables for 4 remain empty We ordered a coffee and half a pint of beer whilst we looked at the menue my wifes coffee was terrible which we returned and my half pint turned into a pint We placed our order only to notice that a couple who came in after us were shown a Lunch Time menu on checking this menu we found that we could have had 3 coarses for the price of our 1 coarse When our food arrived it was very poor in both quality and quantity and not value for money and we felt both meals fell short of the menu desciptions Needless to say we wont be returning ever again 
negative, I didn t get as far as eating here The restaurant was not busy yet they left me sitting for 20mins after I ordered I asked where my drink was and they came back to say sorry but my order was not even in the system How long would they have left me sitting there I wonder I walked out Staff more interested in chatting to each other than looking after customers or clearing tables Very very poor Not attentive at all Watched numerous other customers ask for bills and wait up to 10 mins No excuses 
negative, As far as first impressions go this was up there with the worst We were greeted by the rudest host who really could not care less We asked to sit outside and were told to wait there upon her return we were pointed in the direction of a table in direct sunlight We asked if we could sit somewhere else the response we received was no that s for four people and reserved   After a 20 minute wait we were asked for our order after another 10 minutes we received our bottle of wine but no glasses or even a straw Our starters arrived in good time and to be fair were the highlight of our visit Another 10 minutes passed after we finished and our table was cleared The main course was bland and not much to rave about We asked for the bill which was brought over promptly We stood inside for another considerable amount of time  Outside was an advertisement for 2 courses for 10 95 - I enquired as to why this was not reflected in our bill to be told it is only mon-thurs when our waitress informed the manager she replied with oh f*** and changed the sign with no explanation as to why it did not stipulate the times of the offer  In all a very poor dining experience and will definitely not be returning 
negative, We met up with friends for some coffee I have to say the coffee was quite good and the cakes was very lovely Bill came to around 25 for 3 coffees and two cakes which is reasonable for good quality food We gave a friend some snacks from our travel and friend took it out to take a bite but was told off by staff This is just humiliating because it isn t that we just sat there with water and munch down on outside food Then we were told to leave the premise because they wanted the table to start set up for dinner at 5pm while the other tables were not even set up yet and are all empty It is such a shame that the kitchen staff worked so hard to make great food to let the front room waiters ruin it with their inconsiderate insulting attention to humiliate customers attitude I was so shame to be there and also to have invited people there Whoever wants to dine there will just have to watch up to be insulted before and after enjoying their good food 
negative, Terrible service the man behind the bar refused to serve us despite our producing ID only later would he sell us alcohol then refused our friend being allowed on site on the grounds that we were drinking and that we may give him some as he forgot his ID even though we gave no indication of this and it was before 9pm so he had no legal right nor reason to do this other than personal reasons At no stage had we raised our voices yet he kept being aggressive even more so when we produced the actual law that said our friend is allowed on site as long as he is accompanied by an adult which we proved ourselves to be with our IDs and went on to threaten to ban us all from the pub to which my friend then said he would leave because it wasn t worth the hassle Truly poor service and we felt deeply insulted wouldn t recommend 
negative, I was here last night for a joint 50th-60th there was about 50 of us approx firstly we was so packed in if u was sitting on the inside table u had to crawl under rather than disturb everyone else so very bad seating I understand there was some sort of dbl booking the menu looked pretty good On our table there was a mixture of orders  after our waiter barked at us to pay attention my Indian platter starter was ok a bit sparse my chicken bhuna main was absolutely crap no spice at all really salty and just about warm there was a large plate of rice dumped in the middle which again was warmish again there was a cereal bowl of what I assume was aloo ghobi my uncle opposite had steak chips paper thin hard steak about s worth and them thin cheap as u can buy French fries 50p a large frozen bag in asdas  There was also a duck dish on our table that was ok but looked really unappetising So In general rubbish food as cheap as they can make seemed to b the general feel Service was pretty poor too as we couldn t get out to the bar regular visits by the more than unfriendly waiter would have helped Drink charges were ridiculous me and my wife had a pint of carling and a small diet coke  poured from a large bottle  6 60  After that she just asked for water which begrudgingly gets served without ice or lemon and is room temp lol nice 1 We still had great time though but that s more to do with having a dance floor and the ppl your with rather than any effort by staff Can t see this place lasting long if that s the normal standard of food that s gonna b on offer but hey might just have caught them on a rough night  And at 26 a head that we paid up front they are certainly laughing all the way to the bank  
negative, My wife and I called in last night for a pre film meal Having not booked I asked the young lady behind the bar if they had a free table for two She directed us to a table and I returned to the bar to order drinks Incidentally I noticed that the foursome that arrived just after us were offered table service for drinks our waitress had not seen to do likewise  After returning to the table with drinks we perused the menu and a few minutes later were approached by another waitress who asked if we were the couple who had booked the table for 7 30 I confirmed that we were not After a pause the waitress then said that the table was booked so we d have to move We asked if they had another table and she went off to look She then returned to say there was another table just over there behind the pillar she did not however actually show us where We went in the direction she had gestured but found another reserved table so on catching her attention the waitress then said she would show us She took us to a tiny table right by the door which was completely unsuitable as we would not have been able to get two plates on the table and would have been extremely draughty and cold due to being right by the door We decided we were going to leave but seeing us donning out coats the waitress returned and we explained we were not happy and were not willing to stay She asked if we wished to speak with the manager which we said we did  To his credit the manager immediately told us that we could have the original table as it had not been our fault we had been shown to a booked table  We returned and after a couple of minutes the waitress who had been seeing us returned again to take our order Due to being moved from pillar to post we asked for a couple more minutes at which point she said that as she might not notice when we were ready we should go to the bar to order  Needless to say that was the final straw I paid for our drinks and we left  There seems to be a great need for some serious customer service training at the Brewhouse & Kitchen as it is simply not good enough at present 
negative, everything wsa terrible the service oh w0w we had to wait half an hour to get seated and there were only three other couples in the restaraunt it was so so terrible    never going back 
negative, We have had good meals here and bad meals It is a nice pub with separate dinning and bar area  I have ahead a great steak followed by one that was so tough it was inedible  We keep giving them another chance but have now said enough is enough and stop going  It is a popular pub so we must be unlucky 
negative,I do not like carvery at the best of times but this all depends on when you arrive it can be dried up and poor value staff just want bums on seats and don t really care 
negative,Unfortunately the food is of poor quality with many items repeated albeit with different sauces Most of the items appeared over cooked or dried out For example the sesame prawn toast was so dry and brittle it shatters when attacked with a fork The cubed pork was dry and quite indelible Sweet & sour dished have a bright fluorescent orange glow I ordered a Chinese tea which came as loose tea in a very large mug with coffee written on it The staff force you to sit where THEY want you to sit and almost and almost rugby tackle you to the floor should you approach the door to leave Apparently this is so they can check you have paid extremely disconcerting and rude Evening meals Sunday to Thursday 9 99 per person It is what it is If you want filling up then this is the place to go If however you are looking for quality food then I strongly suggest you look elsewhere  Ambience - there isn t any brightly lit with industrial lighting and visible industrial air vents on the ceiling Tables and chairs are tired looking 
negative, This was the worst meal we have ever had Supposed to be a Sunday roast However that meet was processed and only tasted of salt Yorkshire puddings had been microwaved and like rubber The vegetables were cold and pitifully small amounts On the good side we refuse to pay they accepted this and we were charged with the drink s 
negative,Pizza was tasteless and greasy Must have thought drinkers at 1 00am don t count Only went here because it was one of a very few left open a that time Mistake learnt 
negative,Unfortunate experience for a chain that has two brunches within 5 min walk Understand why they are looking for s chef All dishes we had were lacking seasoning Paid 25 for a peace of meat that was clearly frozen and no one even check if it was any better after sending it back  Terrible service Extremely rude hostess who had attitude and manager who didn t make a point when we complained We were offered desserts on the house but we didn t not complain to get anything on the house We were just disappointed and will never come back  This place seriously needs to be avoided 
negative, Firstly the service was terrible and the pub was clearly understaffed The drinks prices are truly extortionate the pub area was not clean and there were lots of empty glasses everywhere To top the experience of the food was mediocre at best 
negative, It was a warm spring day when I entered Whelans fish and chip restaurant on recommendations of a former work colleague I had met for a catch up meeting It s a place I have visited some time ago so we went to enjoy our lunch  How disappointed I was  There is no available wifi or Internet connection at Whelans and as I was expecting an important call I spent 10 minutes outside in the street trying to obtain a connection  I decided to try the lunch time haddock special I wish I had avoided the place altogether  Having experienced language barrier difficulty with one of the many foreign staff employees Whelans employ my customary included in price bread and butter arrived with cup of tea in advance of my meal  I had to immediately return the bread and butter as it was clear it was neither fresh nor edible The bread was hard as though it had not been freshly prepared for consumption The replacement was a little better but certainly not freshly prepared as you would expect Even if the bread and butter is prepared in advance there is a way of storing food so that it does not become exposed to heat and atmospheric deterioration Whelans appear not to understand this simple method of storage  Whilst waiting for my meal I looked around the seating area to check the cleanliness of the place I was shocked to see on the floor adjacent to me pieces of a last customers food droppings still on the floor  See photographs   There was also a fork on the floor sticking out under my table support which leads me to believe little attention is paid to cleaning or health and safety aspects during the day s activities  When my meal eventually arrived I was surprised at the tiny piece of fish on the plate  See photograph  This does not compare with other photographs advertising Whelans  It was evident the fish had not been cooked for a sufficiently long enough time as the batter was soggy next to the fish The chips were certainly not fresh in an establishment with the rapid turnover of customers The mushy peas were barely warm I can say I did not enjoy what little I consumed  I made a specific point of speaking to the waiter who served me who in turn appeared to mention this to a supervisor There was no offer from the supervisor for me to return to Whelans at their expense at at a later date to see if things had improved just a mere I m sorry  Even the card pay terminal had problems with connection and there was even a mumbling my card might be declined as it was taking a long time to authorise  Whether my comments are heard and acted upon by Whelans remain for others to judge I would not want to return to Whelans in a hurry  A thoroughly disappointing experience I would not recommend Whelans  
negative, You are greeted at the doorway by a queue of people waiting for a table It is possible to book but there are a very limited number of tables available for booking Once you are shown to your table you then have to stand up and go and join another queue to order your food The people distinerested students behind the ordering bar get your order wrong repeatedly When your food eventually turns up it s been loving dumped from a height onto a plastic tray  plates haven t hit this part of Wycombe yet You then have to tell the waitress to actually come back with your full order  The food itself is utterly substandard Imagine a menu developed by a person who has been told about the greatest US BBQ restaraunts but doesn t understand the principle at all Items that should have had hours of slow raoting in a smoker are quite clearly just shoved in the oven The pulled pork tastes low quality the ribs are dry and tiny the brisket is dry and uninspiring   you get the idea I suspect there isn t even a proper smoker on the premises and everything seems to be done with dry rubs  or worse supplied to the place already seasoned  Once you ve finished your drink you re forced to abandon your meal mid course to go and queue up again just for a second drink Get used to queuing  In our case as our food was being served a waiter they dn t do any waiting so what do you call them  a server asked us how our meal had been  that we hadn t had  The toilets look like a primary schools but with zany buckets instead of sinks  which were dirty  The amazing thing is that this place is still open and still seems to do a good trade It s almost like there is no decent restaurants in Wycombe to compare this against  You could vaguely say that the portions are decently sized if you can actually stomach the food - My undiscerning friend ate all of his but he eats almost anything and only judges things based on portion size  You d be better off walking up the hill to TGI Fridays their ribs are about 20 times better That s shameful 
negative, Living in Lambourn we have passed the Cafe in the High Street many times and regularly commented on how nice it looks and that we must try it out Occasion presented itself this weekend when we had overnight guests following a dinner party so the five of us four adults and an child popped in for a breakfast On arrival we stood by the counter and waited to be greeted despite the cafe being well staffed and quiet rather than being greeted I had to ask if we could take a seat and pull up an extra chair I was told that that would be ok so we sat down and chose from the menu We were not aware that there was no table service so waited for one of the three unoccupied counter waiting staff to come over and take our order  Having decided we waited patiently for about ten minutes by which time I realised that no one was coming without prompt so asked if someone could take our order or if we needed to come to the counter I was told that we had to come up to place our order so got up and placed it One of our number a pescatarian and asked if he could have a breakfast with a bean burger in stead of sausage and bacon his request was denied and he was told that the bean burger was not available before noon no explanation or alternate vegetarian option was proffered  Although the initial wait of twenty minutes for two items one of the omelets and a panini was not excessive the standard breakfast omelet + hash brown and child s sausage + hash brown were not delivered to the table for a further fifteen minutes which meant we were not able to eat together this occurred without comment or apology Omelets and panini were very nice but standard breakfast  which came out with the second omelet was a massive miss it came out missing toast with sausage egg and bacon all over cooked and cold hash browns were a bit grey + under cooked and barely warm inedible so sent back with the child s see * below  and beans a mixture of hard and properly cooked but again sadly cold which my wife just left  There was a further wait of five minutes for my son s sausage and hash brown sausage was freshly cooked and fine but * hash brown was as above As our guests were the first to be served and were now waiting for us we decided to leave the cafe without making further comment This may be coincidental but my son and I were the only two to have the hash browns and both have an unsettled stomach  As an aside the vacant  engaged sign on the toilet shows vacant when actually engaged I thought the door was stuck when trying to take my boy to the loo and was on my way to the counter to report the issue when a staff member came out I told her about the occupancy indicator and was surprised by her dismissive reply of oh yea that s fine  from over her shoulder not even bothering to engage me  Having read a few of the other posted reviews I can only conclude that we were unlucky to have visited when management were not present as our experience although following a thiem seems far from typical 
negative, We have used this takeaway in Helsby for the last 5 years and to begin with we were impressed However in the last few visits over the last 12 months things have gone steadily down hill  Went and got a takeaway last night it was the worst meal I ve had from there and will not bother ever returning     I had initially tried to arrange home delivery 3 miles away but was told that they had no delivery driver available and this was 7pm so I ordered over the phone and went to collect I paid an Indian women wearing a hijab at the front desk and waited for my order only to watch the same women 5 minutes later carry a cardboard box full of cooked food out to her car and go on a home delivery    The food we ordered consisted of Onion Bhaji starter x 2 Seikh Kebab starter Nawabi Chicken main course x 2 & Garlic& Butter Chapatti x 3 instead of rice total 22 90  The Onion Bhajis were greasy and tasteless the Seikh Kebab was stone cold & a very small portion The main courses were mediocre & lacking taste considering their own menu states that this is the most complex of all curries made using 21 separate ingredients it was a complete let-down The Garlic & Butter Chapattis were bland greasy & tasteless with no Garlic or Butter  Having spent most of this morning since 4am dashing to the toilet with an upset stomach I can only suggest going elsewhere as there is far better food to be had   
negative, I had been to eat in richmond fish works before and had a wonderful experience I went in today again at lunch time to get fish and chips but I m very disappointed the experience was not the same We went in to get takeaway fish and chips The supervisor the man who greeted us in wearing a pink shirt I am guessing it was the manager was not very welcoming and as we asked for the fish and chips he asked where we wanted to seat We sat down had our meal which was fine The rest of the staff was very good and helpful but the supervisor unfortunately not so much When we asked for the bill it was our surprise the fish and chips cost of 13 95 when on the board outside it said 7 95 I mentioned it to one of the staff we were not expecting that and she then called the supervisor which instead of apologising was rather rude in the way he spoke to us When we sat down he did not tell us each dish would be an extra 6 for eating in but he said he pointed to the menu I think there was probably miscommunication between both parts but was very disappointed with the way he addressed the situation 
negative,Went on friday evening About 7pm There were 5 others in the restaurant eating My brother and I had the 10 95 buffet Neither of us were impressed Food was bland  Not much taste Although the chicken on sticks were nice Will not being going back and would not reccomend
negative,Shame on you Mark Hix This bar has been set up to part tourists from their cash Some of us live and work in London and expect to be treated better Bar snacks must be ordered as we have a restaurant licence is utter nonsense No other similar establishment in the area has the same policy Not stocking premium spirits so that you can palm off inferior ones and pocket the difference We were not born yesterday And wont be returning 
negative, I never complain in restaurants because I have never really had to but last night the experience fell a mile short of a good night out  This is the second time I have been to Made in Italy on the Kings Rd and the second time I have left furious The first time was on my birthday nearly 18 months ago and people came from all over London for it and that was abysmal no choice of pizza very overpriced and shocking service There were 20 of us there and cost per head was similar to last night at 47 each When a friend suggested we go to yours again I was already apprehensive  The starters and the platters of meat etc were good very good in fact But the pizzas are just not up to much it is like you really don t care either they had very little cheese on them so were almost exclusively tomato or they were over flowing with cheese Generally you brought out a selection of very boring pizzas why don t you ask people what they want The only pizza anyone actually wanted was the Pepperoni pizza  We then ordered a second lot of pizzas so at least we might get some choice of what we could have I asked the waiter for pizza with pepperoni cheese and some olives A pretty standard meat pizza  and that is literally what we got pizza base entirely cheese but peppers the vegetable no pepperoni and a few olives I couldn t have been more specific  Then when the pudding came the waiter gave us no choice just coffee Tiramisu To make things worse it was clear that half had been either left out in a warm kitchen and the others had been in the fridge It didn t taste great and was basically very soggy Again it s like you just don t care  The service was shocking too the staff really couldn t care if we were there or not and clearly their English is not good enough either If your staff can t be bothered get rid of them its London there are thousands of people looking for work They ignored us they weren t friendly they didn t smile etc What really annoyed me and I think most of us was the price Firstly 12 5 is excessive and a European service charge rate  47 for that evening was just far too much even if it had been perfect we basically got  of a bottle each starters thee pieces of pizza and a pudding I can only imagine that people paid it because they were too worried about offending the birthday girl  Its really embarrassing taking people out and then having so many people disappointed what s the point The manager I spoke to afterwards tried to give us more Limoncello but it was too little too late  What you have at Made in Italy is a great concept the starters are excellent the idea of the metres of pizza is great but that s about it Your pizzas are so basic in ingredients that it becomes a chore eating them It s not supposed to be Pizza hut thank God it isn t but if you compare yourself to Pizza Express they would beat you hands down They have plenty of tomato plenty of cheese   herbs meat etc you can t just rely on the fact that you use Pizza ovens for your uniqueness  The manager said he had been there for two weeks and that things were going to improve They really need to Whats more they dont reply to complaints hence me on here they were given at least two weeks to return reply to my complaint 
negative,It was raining We were wet - the four of us oldies - all in our sixties and touring Yorkshire Zilli s is nicely placed and brightly lit perhaps overbrightly on a corner of Trinity Square Two or three tables were busy out of maybe twenty First problem - nowhere to hang our coats and umbrellas dripping over the nice wooden floor No big problem - the waitress brought a bucket out of the kitchen and we put our umbrella in that and hung our coats over chairs on empty tables Not exactly smart but hey this place calls itself as a caf€÷ The waitress asked for our voucher Apparently no-one but no-one goes to Zilli s in Hull without a discount voucher We said uh  sat down and picked up a voucher left on the table The offer didn t interest us Nice light Italian menu - looked OK Indeed the food whenever and however it came wasn t too bad at all We ordered  Forty minutes later and after two other tables which filled after we came in were served we were still NOT served We checked with the waitress yes just the ONE waitress for the whole restaurant  She checked with the chef - yes just the ONE chef and his one assistant  She told us 7 minutes - the time it takes we later discovered to cook a thin crust pizza 12 minutes later some of our order arrived Two thin crust pizzas with the WRONG topping A Caesar salad with chicken also came but we had ordered plain She took all this back and said it would be another 7 minutes the time it takes she said  to cook a thin crust pizza Well better serve our friends we said before their dishes get cold One a pasta served with rather too much sauce was fine The other another pizza wrongly topped but acceptable Our 2 friends of course had finished by the time the first lot of wrong pizzas and Caesar had been replaced 12 minutes later Even the replacement pizzas were incorrect - topped with rocket and parmesan cheese it said on the menu No rocket No parmesan Three minutes later a bowl of rocket and parmesan turns up As I said the food itself wasn t too bad - though cooked on hot stone was a bit of an overclaim for the thin crust pastry - or the stone just wasn t hot enough as the bottoms were still soft and the pastry not even scorched But the service was quite the most atrocious I have ever experienced And without apology Apparently - get this - the TILL was to blame Three people - one waitress and two kitchen staff - and they blamed the TILL for lack of communication By the time we had finished our marathon several other tables had filled and by the sound of it wrong orders were going out left right and centre We complained when the bill was presented - over 60 - to He who seemed to be most senior  I would have said in charge but that would be to overstate his competence a sallow yoof with massive earlobe plugs who hung around behind the bar We pointed out that we had been quite upset by the service as we were showing our friends from Sweden how good Hull was these days We said the sort of service we had experienced would have been totally unacceptable in London from where we had just come His response - but I come from Hull  you re having a go at me  it s the till s fault  Not a single word of apology passed his or anyone else s lips We offered him 50 and left We SHOULD have offered 10  Do NOT go here 
negative, I visited your Bluewater outlet on Saturday 15th August with a friend and was seated at a table that was not covered by the walk way above and while eating our meal someone decided to pour what appeared to be a white granules maybe salt off the top floor of the shopping center that covered both of us all our food and drinks I appreciate this is not some thing that is directly a fault of your staff  other than poor table placement but we then got up and moved tables and explained to a member of staff that just said ok and walked off I expected a manager etc to come over and see us and ask if there was anything they could do but nothing when we decided to get up and leave someone came to clear the table and ask if everything was ok with our meals i started to explain i couldn t finish the meals due to what had happened and he then started to laugh and cheekily say we should not order so much in future I explained the full extent of what had happened and that I feel that the customer service was sub standard and if we had not had to pay for our meal up front then staff would have been much more eager to deal with the issue in case we decided we would not pay the bill  This has been a very disappointing experience considering I had heard good things about your restaurants in the past and the food was reasonable until i was unable to eat it 
negative, The location of Bill s is convenient as it s in close proximity to the station and Lyric Theatre As a family we have visited Bill s many times at Covent Garden and were very happy with the food and service However we decided to try out the Hammersmith branch as a change but were very disappointed  The ambience and decor of the place is lacklustre and dull in comparison to the other resturant The service from the staff was average and unenthusiastic We didn t like how they offered us to sit on tables close by to other people eating when there were many other tables available in the restaurant It s fortunate we refused to sit at where was offered because while waiting for our main course we saw our food fall from the ceiling through the staircase from the seating area on the floor above onto the table we were previously offered to sit at As one of the waiters had dropped a large tray of food which contained our main meals this then lead to our meal arriving late and it was clearly rushed onto the plate Two of the main courses were left uneaten The special of the crab sandwich didn t contain any crab which is false advertisement on the menu Then the fish finger sandwich was really greasy and wasn t the usual fish fingers that are used in other Bill s restaurants They appeared more like a fish thumb than a fish finger The taste of the fish was very unpleasant and the bread was stale  A very disappointing meal as we have purchased this meal many times previously and it has always been enjoyed We feel that staff shouldn t have to walk up and down stairs to deliver food there is no novelty or quirkiness to delivering food by coming downstairs Not only is it an inconvenience but it most likely comes to the table cold The restaurant needs a dumb-waiter to save on time and man power then perhaps the staff can be more attentive and enthusiastic  However we were given free drinks to make up for the long wait for our dropped main courses and the cost of the crab sandwich was removed from the bill Nevertheless two of our party left the restaurant hungry and staved off the hunger by visiting the Pret a Manger nearby Certainly was cheaper and more edible  Not to mention the glasses on the table were dirty and the cloudy apple juice was warm and not cloudy at all So free drinks as compensation was definitely necessary 
negative, I concur with other writers that the staff were rude having witnessed their interaction with other customers particularly a party who had made reservations which the caf€÷ had lost The food was adequate but overpriced for what it was The service was dreadful - my drink was only served after I had finished my lunch 
negative, We ate here for my birthday meal last Saturday night Having looked at the website we was really excited about eating here as it looked very nice I cant fault the building it looks nice and it really is sadly that s the only positive thing we can say about it we booked a table three months in advance when we arrive we was told our table wasn t ready however after 15 mins we was seated Our drinks order was taken my wife ordered a cocktail from their menu of 4 different cocktails and I ordered a bottle of red wine Some ten minutes later the waitress told us they couldn t do the cocktail so my wife chose another one 5 Minutes later we was told they couldn t do that one either so my wife chose something completely different We ordered our starters my wife opted for garlic bread and the fishcake for me 40 mins later the waitress arrived and plonked the garlic bread on the table minus my starters  I asked where the drinks were as we had been there now for an hour and still hadn t had a drink and was told they were on there way the waitress then come back to the table to ask what wine I had ordered 5 mins later they brought the wrong bottle to the table Finally they brought my wife s drink and the bottle of wine to the table we had finished our starters by now  unscrewed the cap of the bottle and left the bottle and cap on the table next to the glass For main course I had the 8oz Devon sirloin medium cooked it arrived cremated on the outside and raw enough inside a vet could of saved it At this point the barman arrived at the table with a very large glass of wine for my wife and apologised for the poor service we was receiving we hadn t complained at this point so they was fully aware of the issues with service Desert I had the sticky toffee pudding in a butterscotch sauce which I have to say was very good indeed Its a real shame the rest of the food was not to the same standard Two of the waitress both apologised at the end of the meal when we received the bill and both told us there had only been there a couple of days We didn t complain but was thoroughly disappointed with overall experience and will not be returning to eat here which is a shame because the pub itself really is beautiful Overall time in the restaurant for three courses 3 hours and 10 minutes 
negative, My wife and I visited the restuarant on Saturday evening with high hopes but were severly disappointed by the terrible service The Hostess seemed far too busy to pop over the where we stood waiting and then once sat it took 25 minutes before our order was taken with the comment its manic in the kitchen  just what you want to hear before you order   The food itself was just ok but my Calamari doused in balsamic vinegar was a first  fresh lemon yes but balsamic vinegar   Paying was interesting as I had to walk over the the Hostess who again was busy doing everyting but paying attention to ask for the bill only to have to go again 15 mins later as it hadnt arrived  Sadly a very disappointing visit all in all 
negative, Everything was great until I casually asked when paying the bill if the service charge was distributed to staff I was told that it was not This is outrageous not just from a worker s point of view but deceit of the public This should not be listed as  service  rather 12 5 added to your bill by the proprietor DON T PAY IT 
negative, Carpet was filthy wine glasses disgusting unwashed Food was so poor for god sake if you get a combo for two it will only feed a child Will not be going back P 
negative,Would not send my dog here to eat bad food bad service and bad attitude was part of a party of 8 booked in for Christmas dinner that was a joke  Reception unmanned on arrival took an eternity to find anyone party was left sitting at table like stuffed lemons staff made no attempt to serve starters until we asked after sitting at table for 20 minutes then had to locate staff again Starters were not great salmon missing lemon wedges and garnish on 2 out of 3 pre-ordered Main meals served cold and not took kindly when asked if something could be done about this Puddings served cold by staff that did not care Tables around us and one other remaining table still trying to eat while the staff that did exist then decided to start clearing tables - stripped them and through rubbish in black bin bags Just dam right rude No wine drinks menu was offered - told get it yourself from the bar Mince pies and coffee not even offered Whole point of going out for Christmas dinner was lost and spoilt by bad food bad service and staff with a bad attitude asked to speak to the manager - told they were off Will be writing to head office with regards to this shambolic effort and would recommend YOU BOOK ELSEWHERE FOR YOUR 2014 CHRISTMAS DINNER in fact FULL STOP
negative,booked a week early to avoid disappointment got there on time was offered the worst table possible turned it down was offered another table which i accepted sat down for fifteen minutes was not even acknowledged so walked out absolutely bobbins restaurant
negative, Called in at lunchtime 3 of us ordered off the set tapas menu Every dish was cold and not even tasty The waiter who served us was not bothered at all The only plus side was the manager who took control of the situation offered us any meal of the main menu we did not bother and gave his apologies If lunch is not thier thing dont open then 
negative, Visited R&C early Friday evening to start with we were the only couple in the restaurant and service was slow We ordered ok bread and oil to start although this never arrived then my wife s starter of fried garlic mushrooms were soggy and full of water  eventually after another 20 minutes our main courses arrived My wife ordered fried brie which was still cold solid in the middle even the waitress committed that s not good  when her main course came back  I had finished my main course as it would of got cold and they never offered to take that back to the kitchen while we waited for the brie  the brie was a fresh piece but had the same issue cold and hard in the middle  So then my wife asked to see the manager  who agreed with the complaints so offered to comp the brie s My wife said that he can t comp something that she hadn t had  He asked if I wanted another mains to which my wife replied no thank you as I had already finished The manager did comp us the mushrooms and my main   We won t be back for a long time   
negative, We visited on Easter Saturday at 4 30pm A party of nine Assisted by a helpful waitress but that was the only positive thing about our visit Given it was Easter weekend we were told certain items were already not available How does a restaurant manage this Alternatives were offered but when the main courses arrived food was cold or reheated Seven of the nine main courses were sent back and the waitress did tell us everyone was complaining and there were only about five other couples families eating at the time Can only imagine problems in the kitchen Everyone was apologetic and all main courses bar one were removed from the bill but the visit overall was disastrous Thank God for the nearby Tesco so we could buy pizza for supper I doubt we will ever return and I dread to think how a busy Easter was managed Poor Poor Poor by any standard 
negative, This place genuinely is filthy You wipe your feet on the way out you can t wear a decent pair of trousers jeans as the chairs are all filthy stained and sticky The beers including lager cider and ales have an oh-so-funny taste - usually results in a headache and I suspect this is down to dirty lines and or nozzles - it s not cheap either and you spend ages waiting for bar staff who don t know who s next 
negative,Had the misfortune to have lunch here on saterday for the first time  Never again Miserable staff and avery bad management waited an age for the food to arrive and then was told off by the old barman for the asking for our bill   We unfortunately went and stood by the till as we couldnt find a member of staff to ask the manager was talking to other people about his holiday in turky and left the custmer to get they drink as he stood do nathing than talking if you want to get adrink from the bar you have to wait about 10 mint untill the barman haveing his lunch will never back again 
negative, Having a great evening entertaining clients and my good lady Starters all good  Mains turn up steaks all good my king prawn and rice and runner beans as the owner pointed out  gone in two minutes My client game me a third of his steak which was embarrassing  - pointed out my issue to the staff who were polite I explained that I was with clients and did not want to make anything of it but didn t want to pay for my meal 14 on 169 - happy to pay for the service which was great  just not for that meal They gave me 4 00 off - just with my business head on write that rubbish meal off and move on  Would I go back NEVER if the owner chef had sorted me out there and then no issue  Unbelievable 
negative, Frankly the worst and rudest service we have ever had Arrived at around 8 00 in the evening wanting a couple of coffees and a muffin There were three staff on one a young lad with a top knot walked past us and the barrista commented  Where s he off to and looked angry It took a while for her to acknowledge us and my wife who was ordering Eventually she did but half way through my wife asking what she wanted the girl just walked off leaving the other girl behind who clearly didn t know what to do My wife asked if the manager was around but they were not We just put down what we were going to buy and walked out and went to another place in the service centre Utterly appalling service the worst we have ever had an impressive feat in such a short space of time Well done   Either proper training and management or sacking for the staff there is required 
negative, Went to the Jinnah in Flaxton for my birthday dinner with my partner and some friends and the manager proceeded to ask if my partner was my mum to the dismay of all my party just to set an awful atmosphere for the rest of the evening Several orders were forgotten and the manager didnt even have the decency to apologise for any of the mistakes not least to mention the hair that was in the Korma in the Buffet Disgraceful never going again and would certainly not recommend it 
negative, I recently went to Kazan restaurant but was very disappointed The quality of the food was average and the staff were generall very unfriendly It certainly was not good value for money I do not recommend this restaurant The Turkish restaurants in Harringay are of a much better standard and both the food and service there is much better 
negative, Came here last Christmas time the restaurant wast busy only about 5 tables with people on a Friday night the food was revolting The currys me and my partner ordered korma and butter chicken were tasteless i could have made a better one at home using a pataks bottled sauce It was also expensive and I m pretty sure we were overcharged i would advise people with any sense of taste to not even bother with this place 
negative, I very rarely write negative reviews I always tend to find reason not to however for this Afternoon Tea I wanted to point out how terrible it was    I ve wanted to try this for years my friend and I booked for a joint birthday celebration last week with the 4 cocktails      thankfully the cocktails were lovely because the rest was absolutely terrible you would get better service and food in McDonald s and probably enjoy it more We were sat next to two women who also complained each table was given 25 off and told we didn t have to pay service charge of 20  we had absolutely no service apart from receiving the tier even had to ask for plates 3 times  Sadly I wouldn t recommend this in fact I would go as far to tell people not to attend it was an absolute let down 
negative,After deciding on this place for lunch since is seemingly looked the best in the area i was suddenly proved very wrong Although the food was actually quite nice I would never ever go back due to horrendous customer service The assistant behind the counter was incredibly unhappy to be at work never mind dealing with customers and had more interest in watching the TV which is clearly for the customers benefit given the amount of time you had to wait Why any boss or owner of a company would give their staff a chance to indulge in watch TV whilst at work is either an idiot or someone with far too much money to care The assistant had no interest in taking my order never mind making sure I was given the correct drink after at least a half an hour wait for two portions of fish and chips And what kind of fish and chip shop doesn t sell tomato sauce for gods sake   And another fault I found why are the assistants given the oppurtunity to salt and vinegar my meal if i want salt and vinegar why cant i do that myself The food was actually very nice but in terms of basic customer service due to bloody awful and shocking and miserable customer service I would never ever set food in this establishment ever again    Literally no words to describe the level of horrendous service I received 
negative, This was not my choice of restaurant I checked the reviews posted by others before I went to this restaurant last night I paid particular attention to the negative reviews and would say that the restaurant proprietors have not taken heed We were a party of 9 and had booked a table for 7 30 p m Two of the starters were delivered after repeated requests and by the time they had arrived the other members of the party had finished We didn t get our main courses until 9 50 p m Guests at other tables who arrived after us were served ahead of us Some of the mains were lukewarm although mine was hot and tasty We had to scrutinise the handwritten bill to ensure that the charge for one of the mains was deducted as the wrong dish had been served up and apparently was not up to standard The waiter who told us that the charge would be deducted had failed to follow this through The final bill was presented and although we could identify the food items listed the charge for drinks was not itemised and so it was shown as one amount We estimated the cost of it all and were satisfied that it appeared to be in the region of what we would have expected The waiters were non-attentive Having complained about the inadequacies the manager did present us with a complementary bottle of red wine We paid the bill and did not leave any tip I will need a lot of persuading before I dine there again 
negative,Staff were so rude blond hair tall waitress The food is just ok not much better then any pub half the price Very slow service it took about 35 minutes to get my Pimms Completely overpriced and disappointing I would never go back to this place again 
negative, We met up as a family to celebrate my daughters 24th Birthday  There was 9 of us and a baby and table booked for 7 30pm on Saturday 26th April We waited an hour for our Drinks to arrive  We waited almost an hour and a half for our Starters  The Prawn Cocktail was in a liquid  4 Prawns in Total More Drinks were ordered and again half an hour for these to arrive The mains arrived  only when they did we had to wait for cutlery which took 15 mins  by which time mains were getting cold Non of the Management appeared to be interested neither did the waiting staff The Management and Staff need re-training in Customer Service how to meet and exceed their customers expectations I would not rush back to this restaurant at all  It s about time Head Office took notice of its customer comments and acted accordingly 
negative,Food was mediocre at best Appalling service Rude staff Couple on table next to us told us a similar story about one of the other Webbe restaurants Won t try any of them again 
negative, Very poor service  the food was not tasty when we got our food it was the wrong order the waitress didn t know the difference between a ribeye steak and sirloin steak Greasy cold and tasteless prawns Never go there again 
negative, 8 30 Saturday night bar and restaurant both half empty the kitchen which is on view staff just hanging around Try to order food at the bar told 30 minute wait Said that s ok tried to tell him what I wanted only to be told the would not take my order for 30 minutes so I have now got to wait till 9 o clock to order food and they are unable to tell me till then how long before I get it they told me they could not go to the kitchen to find out how long it would take When I said that I not therefore get my food till gone ten I was told quite possible While this conversation took place the manager just stood there  think he was on some YTS placement from the 80s The place does deserve your custom staff do deserve jobs 
negative, Came here for my 27th birthday table of 8 After sitting it was an hour before we got our starters 30 mins for mains after my nans meal came 15 mins after we all had ours our drinks order was wrong the second time round They just seemed understaffed for the big tables and Christmas season Won t be back 
negative,The quality of the food was very poor for the price paid The staff were very inexperienced and not at all polite as you should expect in this type of hotel and restaurant 
negative, I went to this restaurant last night and left feeling extremely dissatisfied  We arrived at 9pm and the restaurant wasn t that busy  We ordered a starter however it never came and instead we received the main course When we pointed it out to the waiter he made some pathetic excuse about the meet still tenderising and that this had caused the delay Why he couldn t have been honest and said he d forgotten I don t know but it was nice being lied too So our starter was served as we were readying ourselves to leave  We ordered Sag Aloo and were given Sag Poneer which they didn t take off the bill   A large group seated in front of us left as we arrived and we had to look at a very messy table throughout the whole evening They weren t that busy so i m not sure why they didn t clear it up and make the place look a bit more presentable  In fairness they did apologise for their mistakes and offer us a free drink but we d reached a point where we just wanted to leave I asked for the bill but the waiter forgot to bring it so I had to remind him  Overall the quality of the food was not great and the portions sizes were small If you are looking for a curry in the area the Shaahi a short walk away is much better Hove Tandoori is also worth a visit as is Chilli Pickle if you fancy a modern twist  I won t be going back on the basis that the food is average and the service incompetent 
negative, Asked for a table for 2 Was asked to wait at the bar for 15mins by the manager and they would have a table Had a drink at the bar upon checking for our table we were given a bar table right by the front door that we could have had at the start and was told to order food at the bar Tired to order at the bar at which point we were told they were out of burgers and all roasts  We could have been told this at the start instead of wasting our time total incompentant manager who just did not care about his customers  not at all warm and actually a very cold experince from the manager Bar staff were nice tho  There are many other options in the area that are fair better than this Thoroughly worth avoiding 
negative, Booked in on Saturday time for a Stag party of 18 only to be told on the door that NO entrance will be granted this was after waiting 10 mins outside in the snow We had a copy of the email sent to us with proof and on this it offered us 2 pool tables for free And what a surprise the lady who booked this wasn t available  We ended up in another bar locally who welcomed all our business  Joke com 
negative,If your looking for poor quality over cooked food that has been deep fried to within an inch of its life then this is the place for you Its only saving grace is that its cheap 
negative, Ask for a Cappuccino and everything comes to a halt This was he same experience as the invested site in Doncaster centre 
negative,Went for Dinner on arrival was told to read a notice to find only half the menu was available but we decided to stay We waited over 15 minutes to be asked for our drinks order  the place was no where near full we then ordered our food and waited a further 20 minutes to have one shared starter to arrive Another long wait for our main course which arrive over cooked and not edible which was only chicken and chips done fancy Spoke to the Manager to complain about the time and quality of the food served which he apologized for the food but said the time delay was what he expected in an Harvester Restaurant He did give a refund for the main course s but we won t be going back 
negative, I m not entirely sure if the place was understaffed 9crazy for the xmas party season  or if orders were just plain slow in coming to pass but to wait 15-20mins for drinks and over an hour for starters is pushing it Plus the continual buckets of taco chips and pork scratchings being put on the table is over-exploitation of the oldest trick in the book i e loads of salty chips crisps on the table makes the diner buy more drinks AHence there was a severe shortage of guacaole and salsa to go with this flood of taco chips The service was friendly enough and you could see that the staff were trying but they were drowning in the crowded melee almost as much as our food was in a bowl overladled withg chipotle sauce I assume it was chipotle Whatever it was it wasn t good and for some reason was slathered over everything that was brough tto the table making it indistinguishable to decipher different ingredients and taste sensations one of the nicer aspects of usual Mexican dining expereinces  Anyway from a set xmas menu pulled pork starter was mediocre yet better than the veggie option of  wait for it  brussels sprouts in a tapas bowl with - you ve guessed it chipotle sauce cascading over them like a lava field from a volcano   oh the irony Main course was duck enchiladas or mushroom and tacos stack both of which came wearing the same slick of chipotle sauce  enchiladas were the girth of a ring finger and perhaps twice as long little duck mainly filled with bean paste - it was an appalling shame given what could have been done with an xmas menu for Mexican flavour angle I left before the churros were delivered but felt very let down given the previously high ranking pedigree of this chain of restaurants  Good Mexican food is a fiesta of flavours on the palate - this was nothing of the sort Finally no xmas decoration in the restaurant that we could see made the immediate surroundinbgs feel like an East German cold war style dining room - nowhere near what it s probably like in Guadalajara at this time of year 
negative,Popped in today with family What food that was out was dry and looked like it was leftovers from the night before The rice was not cooked I didn t even see any deserts And considering there was few customers in at the time the place looked dirty with wallpaper hanging off in places which would suggest why the lighting wasn t on in that area where they sat us 
negative, I am afraid I cannot recommend this establishment Stopped here for my lunch last week the service was slow and the food was not very nice very greasy within an hour of eating here I started suffering the worst Diarrhea I have ever experienced It was so bad that I could not carry on with my deliveries and had to return home to be near the toilet loosing me an afternoons pay If you were thinking of eating here please don t there are far better places to eat along the south coast road that are cheaper and wont poison you you have been warned 
negative,Terrible food - no flavour badly cooked - did my best to eat but truly it was awful Waiting staff very obliging and enthusiastic However the experience reminded me to avoid theme multiple chains where kitchen staff are assembling pre-configured prepared food by pictures  as enjoyable a dinning experience as dot-to-dot is viewing fine art  
negative,Unfortunately I visited this place with my family while staying away from home this was as my wife states one of the worst meals of my life  The food was appalling and we hardly ate any of it the desert was great but then again it was ice cream so you can t mess that up much would never return And to think we drove past the Toby Carvery to get there 
negative,Stay away from this place me and my wife ate there and fell ill for the rest of our get away the Bronco Chicken didn t taste right and felt it was microwaved  Avoid this place like the plague Ruined holiday 
negative, Entering the pub at 13 00hrs we was the ONLY people in their  We was puzzled as to why but ordered our drinks anyway We also ordered our food then we was escorted upstairs to the seating area  We sat alone no other customers our food arrived which was microwaved but then told our daughters meal wouldn t be ready for another 5 mins  15 mins later her meal turned up  Salad was old Jacket spud was dry No atmosphere in the place Waitress was polite and friendly We left the food as it was awful Upon leaving as we walked thru the bar the barman then decided to tell us he d forgot to charge us for an item we d orderd  I d rather eat a cold pasty from Greggs on a rainy day than eat here  It was shocking They thought we was tourists but little do they know we are local and we could have become regulars 
negative, The name fits the food minging  went straight in the bin as it was inedible You would need to have very low standards to enjoy chinese from here 
negative,I had the Bill s breakfast which had poor quality bacon fried eggs which were hard and were clearly old stock from the fridge soggy mushrooms and two small sausages all served on dry toast I still feel ill 10 hours later The child s pancake dish was excellent as was the service but did not mitigate for my appalling fare 
negative, We visited the Harvester pub restaurant at the start of the New Year a week day evening just before 8pm  We waited inside the door way for an age to be seated so long in fact I went to the gents On finally been seated we found that there was bits of food on the chairs and the area under the table and surrounding the table was frankly poor with food and condiment bottles  Strangely once we had been seated we weren t asked what we would like to drink and had to wait until another waitress came over to take our food order  When our food arrived we found the chips to be so over done that they had dried out to nothing and my Fiancee ordered a soft drinks refill and when she went up to fill her glass found that the pepsi max was empty She asked the waitress if her glass could be filled from the bar but was told that the drinks station was been sorted At the time the restaurant had quietened down considerably we tend to find it is quieter after 7 30pm for example  I feel and have done for sometime that this branch of Harvester struggles to maintain good customer service and food quality We have used other local branches previously and have found that the one in Bromsgrove The Forrest  has always had consistent customer service perhaps the one in Redditch should invest more time in staff training 
negative, Have been regular customers at this pub for a meal im very sorry to say that over the last few weeks the standard of thd meals has gone down new chef and the meals are Even worse my wife left hers last w eek and my friends woifes chicken was still pink and raw definitely be giving it a miss from now on 
negative, I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich at 13 95 6 small pieces of beef thumb size in a sauce on a burger bun with some mushrooms I expected a sandwich that I could hardly hold and would leave me nice full but I finished it quickly and started to pick at the kids meals  To charge 14 quid for that is shameful I have been to TGI Fridays several times and always leave content  good food pleanty of it and good service Will not be going back to Frankie and Benny s 
negative, Unpleasant experience  The staff was friendly to start with when I entered the place with another friend We ordered several starters and some mains to share  Whe one of the fish dish arrived supposedly a freshwater fish from India Pakistan  we just could not eat it as the fish was bad When this was brought to the waiter s attention he asked either the manager proprieter to our table who then became hostile and declared to us that it was never mentioned in the menu the fish was fresh We explained that the fish was bad and he just would not have it In the end we just accepted that we will pay for the food if they would take the dish away and voila the smiles came back again  The whole experience just goes to show how superficial these poeple and one has to wonder about the quality of the food that they produce even if some reviewers like the food  Working nearby in Headington this would have been a regular place for me but after this experience I have warned everyone at work in Headington to stay away lest they received similar treatment  This visit was back in 2010 but it was such a bad experience and coming across this restaurant in tripadviser as one of the top recommended place in Oxford I feel I need to share my experience with everyone  Therefore the marked box of Jan 2012 below is done as it does not allow any review before this date 
negative, From the moment we walked through the door to leaving this was a bad experience  We arrived and we were half greeted by a passing waitress who I felt we were interrupting She asked us to look at her list of bookings for a name we recognised as we were meeting friends and didn t know what name the booking was None the wiser I suggested could we order some drinks to which she pointed to some chairs and walked off after 10 minutes and no offer of a drinks order our friends arrived  We were escorted to a table with a wet table cloth we requested to move and were greeted by yet more wet table linen However on the plus side we had now gone from paper napkins to linen We didn t get to sit down we waited while another table was set this time with a paper table cloth and linen napkins  these were later removed and replaced with a stack of small triangular cheap paper napkins on the corner of the table  Next a 15 minute wait for drinks order and 10 minute wait for them to be brought with small pathetic looking wine glasses covered in finger prints  The banquet was chosen by all Soup was best described as bovril at best  Mixed starters the spring rolls were small in length thin like pencils and due to this the filling was barely tastable The pawn toast was thick and probably the best item on the plate The ribs were plenty big enough in size but had enough meat on for a small mouthful  The duck and pancakes came and the duck was taken halfway across the Resturant to be shredded giving the cold pancakes enough time to reach room temperature so they went back and 5 minutes later returned when the duck had cooled enough to spark yet further annoyance  Main course came and the sizzling streak nicely splattered the entire table without much warning  the prawns I don t eat so can t comment the steak was delicious at last some positive The satay dish was quite possibly the worst tasting satay I ve ever had and I like satay dishes the look was not great and the texture slimey The rice wasn t much to be desired either it was very stodgy didn t come across as being freshly made  Quite an effort to get anyone s attention to ask for the bill and then at this stage I just wanted to leave I stood up and paid on my way out  They don t do Amax even though they think they do  [sigh]  they can t even get that right with telling me incorrect information 
negative, afternoon tea what a shame what was meant to be a birthday treat for my 8 year old granddaughter was an expensive mistake Never again Staff rude no customer service and they were not even busy only 3 other customers Sandwiches dry and crisp as though they had been made all day  given a warm glass for a cold drink staff who constantly wiped their noses on the back of their hands  who trains these people give this place a wide birth they don t deserve customers 
negative,You need to serve the people that arrive first at the drive-thru first Rather than have me pull up sit there with my window open getting wet for a minute then have someone pull up at the other order point and have someone take their order straight away You ve lost my custom on three occasions now Fast food means fast food not wait there like a numpty to get jumped in the queue 
negative,i visited the restaurant after seeing the advert in the Bromley News Shopper Not contemporary not fine dining Cold food some not cooked or presented as it should be Waiters unattentive Portion size leaves a lot to be desired if you want a true fine dining experience try Shampan Bromley few doors away you will not be disappointed
negative, We have dinned at other Ask restaurants and have enjoyed them but this one left a lot to be desired We were holidaying in the area and went there for an evening meal it was the hottest week of the year  We were seated quickly but that was it The heat was unbearable there appeared to be some of air conditioning but if it was it was not working The staff seemed more interested in clearing the tables than taking our order we finally ordered starters and main course which took quite a while to come and my wife had a direct view of the pass and our main course was the waiting for well over 10 minutes before it was served Our online comments went un-answered  Don t think we had the same waiter twice A few week later we went to Ask in Beverley but what a difference 
negative, Me and my friend were looking for somewhere to eat on Sunday night so thought we would try the ming cottage in Whitley bay as it looked a nice place from outside  On entering the staff were very friendly and we went to out table and began to order food service was very quick and food tasted ok but that was about as good as it gets  I orderd house special curry with fried rice and prawn crackers with a bottle of Chinese larger My friend orderd lemon chicken with chips and a half glass orange juice  First thing was wow how small the portions were  Then the rice was deliverd in one metal pan which we thought was a bit of a con as the portion of rice was about the size of one portion you would get if you ordered it for one person from a take away  So basicly we both played for rice with our meals and expected a bowl of rice each but got one pan of rice between two disgrace full   Then if that wasn t bad enough after eating our meal we then went to pay and omg  For these two basic meals and with one pan of rice between two came to just under 40  I think personally for tiny piece of lemon chicken  hand full of chips small bowl of curry few prawn crackers and bottle of cheap larger with one portion of rice between two is definetly not a cheap meal at 40   We could of went into Newcastle town center and got all you can eat for half that price lol And as for the meal itself it wasn t nothing spectacular I ve tasted just as good for a lot less   Would definetly not recommend unless you like spending a lot for very little  Will never return which is a shame because it seemed a lovely restaurant and staff were very polite but I m not surprised at these prices  
negative,Faulty Towers meet Bollywood I wish I had listened to the last reviewer when they walked out as we also waited 1 5 hours for our meal which I feel was Uncle Beans curry sauce which the waiter nipped to the Co-Op to get whilst we waited We were still expected to pay the bill in full despite the lonnnnnnng wait 
negative, We have been to this restaurant a couple of times and have always enjoyed it Nice pizza good atmosphere but unfortunately this opinion changed when we ordered a takeaway when a few friends visited We promised the best pizza around but unfortunately when we got them back they were wet cold and floppy Basically inedible When my wife phoned to let the restaurant know about this unfortunate experience she was told in no uncertain terms that it was out fault for ordering takeaway and we should have expected it to be cold and wet as we had ordered mozzarella and then hung up Wow 
negative,Having already eaten at the restaurant last year my wife and I decided to stop off for drinks before moving on to an Italian we had already booked The seating outside the main Restaurant is both centrally located and comfortable with a pleasant view the drinks are comparable with other cocktail bars although expensive What takes the biscuit though is the policy on glasses or should I say plastic ones having ordered a glass of both gin and tonic and prosseco I was staggered to be given a plastic beaker for the gin and tonic and certainly not drinks they charge premium prices for at 7 50 a shot The muppet who introduced this policy needs to justify why he serves beer in a glass along with wine and other drinks and yet introduces a policy even his own staff cannot justify for other drinks to be served in plastic containers I could understand it if glass breakages were an issue but the floor was an artificial cushioned grass and the policy is as I ve said not a blanket one its just not joined up thinking 
negative, The staff are polite enough they re just lazy and walk around with their eyes closed We ordered our drinks after we were seated but they sat on the bar for a good 20 minutes before we decided to just get them ourselves Bit of self service - like nandos but with awful chicken I had the spicy chicken for starters which wasn t spicy and was served with glossy mayonnaise The chicken was weirdly gooey too The gourmet burger was just a less than average beef burger sandwiched inbetween a dried out brioche bun Very disappointing 
negative, My family have ordered takeaways and dined in at this places lots of times and have always been treated great  So Have we  However we all ordered a takeaway on the 17th September when I came it was all wrong and wasent what we had ordered  My wife s mum having coeliacs disease couldn t eat what they brought  So we fined up to complain and the guy on the fone accused us of lying and said it wasent wrong  I asked if I could speak to the person in charge and apparently that person wasent there  The person on the fone wasent helpfully at all  I only have one thing to say THINK BEFORE YOU ORDER                 
negative,Just dreadful expensive and tasteless Like a modern take on the old Wimpy restaurant  Staff quite sweet but not enough to make me want to waste 30 again Toilets disgusting  Photo an 11 chicken burger the size of a squashed meatball 
negative,Have used this restaurant on numerous occasions over the last decade and have seen it go through various ups and downs so was really pleased to see it looking like it was back on a roll The setting is lovely but the food was awful - go and have a drink on a nice day but don t waste your time or money on the food 
negative, Stopped there the way to London Big mistake Terrible service Warm Cokes Horribly expensive food  Don t stop Drive to the next service stop 
negative, We eat here as a family and with friends on a frequent basis always had a pleasant time and no problems This will be the last time we eat here  Having joined friends and their children after parents evening at school nearby we had hoped for the usually good service and food however this has to be the absolute worst evening here or anywhere else for as long as I can remember Once we joined our friends the usual process of choosing food and ordering drinks took place So far so good There were no complicated requests and everything was directly as offered on the menu bar the exchange or mash for fries on one of the children s meals children s meals requested to come with the adults starters  The starters arrived in a reasonable time although considering there were only four other tables occupied it was hardly whisked out At this point it began to go down hill rapidly Starters we cleared then we waited  and waited  and waited The children we starting to become agitated and even more hungry We asked once  twice  three and finally on the fourth occasion they came down 40 minutes after the starters they should have arrived with The request for the fries instead of mash had been ignored and so once child sat and waited whilst the other began to eat thankfully there was some sharing to stave off the hunger  Another 10 minutes the second child s meal is produced - sausages fries and two yes two measly carrot batons see photo - are you kidding me This is a go to meal so we knew what to expect At this point we were also wondering where our main courses were We waited a little longer  and longer  and longer After a further 29 minutes the main courses began to arrive Two adults had their main courses delivered and eventually 10 minutes later PART of the other two main meals When we pointed out we were still waiting for two further dishes part of the main course we waited  and waited and eventually they came The first two main courses had been finished and the two adults trying to entertain tired children that had waited over an hour to eat and then had to wait even longer because the food for the adults had not come out properly either Eventually the final dishes arrived everyone was way over it and just wanted to leave The finally injustice sticking point and rude snub was yet to come   To make matters worse and what can only be described as incompetent cowardice from the manager he didn t approach our table throughout the whole ordeal not even to offer the pitiful gesture of goodwill in reducing the bill by less than 5 to start with of approximately 150  He had left the task to his waiting staff all of whom we apologetic if not a little unaware  Once this was declined a further amount was reduced but by no means a fair compensation for what we had endured but how many times can you keep going back Disgraceful We paid left and sadly will not return 
negative, Came here on Saturday so the kids could play for a while and then have a nice meal afterwards never been before so we checked both the website and Facebook but struggled to even find an opening time We arrived and then we re turned away as it s a private party on weekends Apparently every weekend am is a private party So why is it Not on the website or Facebook that this is the case  Were were given some contact details by a very nice lady member of staff who was helpful But then we were approached by a completely obnoxious moron member of staff who started arrogantly saying well it s on the website  When I challenged his knowledge he soon backed down saying well I don t know    If you don t know why include yourself in a grown up conversation    Really Definitely a place we shall avoid in future and let everyone we know of our experience  Very poor  
negative, We thought we would try this one for a change never again no taste to anything will never use again there are far better Take away places in Horley 
negative, i had the large mixed grill the meat was disgusting dried up microwaved chicken dried up rock hard pork tasted crap the plus side the chips were ok the wife had chips fish the batter was soggy and the fish had been run over with a steam roller worst meal i have ever had 
negative, Food is Aweful no care in cooking the food Burger was dry and steak under cooked  served it to me raw Breakfast not that great either on a positive side they do have costa coffee 
negative, After waiting an age for our food we had both ordered burger and chips but with different toppings my partners came out stone cold and my chips were so scalding one burnt my mouth Partner and were both ill afterwards To top it all the side salad was made with raw cabbage instead of lettuce We won t be going there again 
negative,Had our meal refunded tonight Truly awful  After ordering starters and getting them fairly quickly Although when it took 15 minutes to bring some barbecue sauce for the starters I should have suspected something was amiss When the waitress did bring the sauce our starters had been eaten and we got the platitude  oh well it ll save me bring some for your mains  Talking about the main courses I had to chase the staff and they arrived 40 minutes later  When they did arrive my medium rare steak was charcoal and my wife s salmon wasn t even recognisable it was that brown  that s right brown No sign of anything pink and it was so dry  Asked for a refund and the waitress went to get the manager who must be so used to refunding on cr@p food that she couldn t even be bothered to come across and apologise just sent the young waitress back with a refund on the main courses  No offer of a full refund for an evening out ruined just the bits we didn t eat or drink  We ate here a week ago and the meal was lovely but tonight it was so far off the mark I was amazed  We used to eat here weekly before but we won t be returning and can t recommend this place 
negative, The caf€÷ was filthy but not busy The floor was littered with food scraps and used tissues as well as a liberal sprinkling of sand which on a lino floor is a major slip hazard Staff were attentive during our purchase but their attitude changed when they had our money I had to clear an overflowing tray of crockery to be able to sit at a table I took the tray to the counter only to be told trays go on the racks  when I said it is not even my stuff I was ignored There were no tissues available Much of the washed cutlery was speckled with dirt I took several minutes to find a half clean couple of forks which I had to further clean with my own tissues Not very impressive for such a beautiful location 
negative, Came here tonight 08 02 2014 and the service was terrible I have a food allergy as well as other people in the party of 16 and they brought food out with the food in it I was told what I can and can t have with my meal I had steak and ask for a plain naan and was told I can t have that food came cold we were told to be quiet when they were bringing the food out The food that did come out hot was nice but the serive is terrible All of the party have vowed never to come back 
negative, Amigos offers what it seems more like Indian food I went with my friends and had various dishes All were the same chicken filling similar to Chicken Tikka covered with beans and cheese The food was very bad nothing like Mexican food  The service can also be improved I will never go back to this Restaurant a waste of time and money  From a Mexican 
negative, Owner rushed us We felt like our custom wasent required and the owner kept making passes at my husband 
negative, We had a meal at Prezzo s in Tring on the 28th of August 2016 celebrating my daughters birthday We have always enjoyed and excellent experience in the past but must admit was left very disappointed yesterday evening I felt the portion sizes were insulting to say the least for the money we paid I mentioned this the waitress who was very sympathetic and offered us free deserts after I said I am not sure if we would ever come back She said it was because it was very busy which is an awful excuse because if you do not have the ingredients or staff to cater for a busy Sunday evening don t take so many bookings Like I said the waitress was lovely with her empathy and I do not blame her at all as she was lovely however I am not sure if I will return as it did leave a sour taste in our mouth and all we talked about on the way home was how poor the portions were and the excuse given instead of what a lovely meal we had 
negative,We had tried this place for the 2 previous years we had a bad meal in 2009 and throught we won t go there again However our Guest house owners said it had improved and we gave it a second chance in 2010 Same again bad service My daughter dropped her fork on the floor the Waiter picked it up and gave it back without cleaning one of many bad service calls  we waited forever for the food and when it came it was cold In fact someone did a runner not in our group because they were so dissatisfied We won t be going back again Anthony
negative, Shocking food and shocking service Don t care how cheap it is not worth a penny Food is wouldn t feed to my dog Rubber and burnt Even my kids said no to the food They missed 2 items from our order and made a mistake that could have caused a trip to hospital 
negative, Went to the Fieldhead for a family roast today Sunday    it was awful  the menu stated perfect Sunday Roast how wrong could they have been  the meat was tough and tasted disgusting the veg was warm but not cooked at all the mashed potato was basically out a packet and the gravy had solid lumps in it   we had the manager over to complain to which he replied I can get you replacement meals but they will be no better they offered me and my brother turkey and chips  not quite the Sunday roast we went out for The Manager thought that 18 chips and two slices of turkey was good value for money as a direct replacement for our meal   which was 9 99  This hotel pub is an absolute disgrace The manager openly admitted that none of the food is prepared on site but is all prepared and bought in by an external company and then Fieldhead just warm it up in their kitchen so basically ping food people be aware this place is awful  
negative,I hand my family have never tasted vile food before in our life Went at Xmas and staff no better than 5 rate Never  never again JACK WALMSLEY 
negative, Let me start by saying I love John Lewis Time and time again when I visit any of their stores I m reminded how I wish every shop had such attention to detail and great customer service Oh John Lewis why not the same with your cafe The cake tasted like an Iceland frozen gateaux and the latte was the weakest coffee I ve ever tasted  Please sort yourself out we know you can do better as the flagship store of Birmingham Grand Central 
negative, Greasy stodgy and overall felling ripped off 
negative, I took a group of ~34 people to Lebaneat for our end of year rowing meal We booked in advance and confirmed on the day exact numbers of people and details - such as vegetarians We were told that everyone would be receiving the same starters of a platter of mixed starters We were then told that meat-eaters would each be getting meat platters chips rice and salad Vegetarians would get to choose their own dish off the menu - all 15 each Sounded fine All confirmed  We turned up and realised quickly that we d only been given 29 seats When I told the manager he told me I was wrong upon counting together he realised HE was wrong He promised to get us more seats ASAP Even after much pressure we still didn t have any new seats 2 hours later when we left  As to the food We were given 6 for a group of 34 medium sized platters with both the starters and the mains on them that not one person in the group thought were worth 15 Moreover to being small they were not at all what we ordered But even worse they had put the vegetarian starters on the same dish as the meat dishes and couldn t understand why this was not acceptable When the vegetarians finally received their food after much discussion the manager wanted us to apologise and thank him for the service of getting it  I could have accepted all of this But I cannot accept our treatment The manager shouted at both me and my friends even though he was at fault The manager got aggressively in my face at one point I genuinely felt worried he would hit me - I was not being aggressive back In fact the kitchen staff who were polite actually had to virtually drag him away at one point as did the other manager on another occasion They never apologised for this appalling treatment either the only explanation was given by one waitress who joked that it was just Arabic temper  I do not think shouting at paying customers is a joke Especially when you are in the wrong The whole group agreed that they wanted to leave ASAP We did eventually manage to convince them down to a reduced price of 10 per head which many still thought was too much  The real punchline of the evening they made a fuss when I asked them to remove the 40+ service charge  I can t comment on the food as I never got to taste more than rice and cucumber but I will never ever return here And as a side note my friend and his mum went the next day as a 2 told me the service was poor and impolite and the food was at best average Clearly I believe this restaurant has a very serious customer service problem 
negative,I went here with my fiancee last night From the outside it looks like a nice tidy well-kept pub We went in Most of the drinkers were clustered around the bar and at our entrance every pair of eyes swiveled to see who d come in - it was like intruding on personal space  My fiancee took a seat and I waited at the bar to be served Eventually a well dressed lady came up behind the bar Instead of asking me for my order she focused on the guy I was standing beside evidently a regular His glass was empty and she demanded to know what he wanted it refilled with He took some considerable time thinking about it - in fact it appeared that he didn t really want a refill at all Frankly had I been on my own I d have walked out at that point After a couple of minutes she turned to me and snapped  yes   We d intended to have a couple of drinks and a meal whilst we were there but I simply wasn t going to part with any more of my hard-earned cash in such an undeserving business We finished up our drinks left and went to the Angel a couple of miles up the road I ve posted a review of our visit there - a stark contrast to this place  My conclusion - if you re not a local give this place a wide berth It looks very nice from the outside appearances can be very deceptive at times 
negative, I admit I only came here for a takeaway The outside looks really fancy  Like some 80s vision of China The flagstones though are sprouting grass and the place looks neglected in closer inspection I don t suppose that really matters though  Inside it s the same Really over the top 1980 far eastern meets England The seats in the waiting area are like a shiny red plastic cover and the seats and tables in the restaurant look like your mums wedding dress  The most important thing is the food though and maybe the buffet which seemed popular was OK The takeaway though was awful A big red mess of jelly and chicken  Aware of making unproven allegations let s just say one of the ingredients did not agree with me my fault I m sure  and my stomach has not been the same for a few days  The waitress that took my order needed to know the numbers of the menu of the meal  She didn t actually know the menu  It brought to mind Dell Boy yelling menu item numbers at some poor Chinese waiter in the 70 s  I m sorry it was so bad Again maybe the buffet is better 
negative, as my title suggests the starters were great Kimchi selection sashimi beef seafood omelette All good and I wish we had left then  One main was ok - kimchi tofu and rice Simple ok but portion so tiny could have been a starter for an anorexic  The seafood bibimba smelled so bad I could not bear to even taste it so I can t really tell you how horrible it was A cross between an open sewer and tinned squid My fellow diners tried to share it but even though we have all eaten Asian street food and in Korean eateries for years this pile of muck defeated us  Friend had beef rib bibimba and now we know where Shergar has gone A cross between a flip flop and a bone my dog would reject Tiny amount of meat tinier portion of vegetables and 90 oily water  Vile horrible food and now we know why it was empty in the middle of soho on a Saturday night   Fingers crossed they have a short lease and that a decent Korean chef will take over soon 
negative, I went to the New York Cut on a works doo and it was one of if not the worst meals I ve ever had there were 14 of us in the party when we turned up we were the only people in the place other than one unlucky couple We the proceeded to wait 1hour to be seated in an all but empty restaurant  Once seated and at this point fairly hungry everyone picked there main off what seemed to be a nice menu we ordered a variety of the steaks on offer Two of the party specifically asked for the steaks to be well done as they really didn t like blood in there steaks We then proceeded to wait another hour and a half at which point the steaks started coming out in drubs and drabs I was first which I was happy with as at this point after 2 and a half hours of waiting I was incredibly hungry as you can imagine I started eating my steak which I asked for medium however got blue it might aswell have not been cooked and for a 28 day mature rib eye had a lot of sinew in it and was incredibly chewy By the time I d forced the steak and 3 chips down which I couldn t leave as I was that hungry or send back as God knows when I d see it again there were still members of the party that hadn t even been served yet Oh and the two members who had specifically asked for there steak well done and no blood were almost as rare as mine AVOID THIS RESTAURANT LIKE THE PLAGUE  
negative, Opened a few minutes late food not ready coffee machine not heated having only just been turned on porridge cold I could keep going   Maybe a bad day but not up to Premier Inn usual standards 
negative,We went on 20th December at 8pm We had book weeks in advance as it was our department xmas dinner  When we arrived we were shown to a long thin tressle table this was cramped and because of the narrowness of the table and the noise did not allow for conversation with anyone apart from your immediate neighbour There was a large office party at the tables next to us They were shouting accross stamping and clapping all night which fankly left me with a headache  The starters were fine The mains arrived at the table lukewarm There was a small dish of carrot mash and sprouts between each four people I know it s french infulenced but it certainly wasn t adequate for the money  When dessert was served those people who had been served Christmas pudding they found it was stone cold A number of them had tried the pudding The waiter took them away and returned after 10 minutes We assumed that they were cooking fresh When they came back to the table we started eating them when a colleague shouted stop  he realised that someone had been eating the Christmas pudding that had be given to him The waiter admitted that they had microwaved the puddings to heat them but he couldn t tell whose was whose and therefore we were eating something that somebody else had been eating   When we complained they said there was nothing they could do We suggest that we shouldn t be charged for the desserts and the waiter laughed and said it s part of the set menu so there is nothing we can do  We had selected the 39 95 set menu - with their exorbitant service charge this came to 51 per head plus wine  I certainly won t be going here again and would recommend that everyone else stays away 
negative, Arrived Monday evening around 830 looking for a table for two Restaurant was about half full and after a couple of minutes at the door were greeted and offered a cramped table of two in between 2 other couples I asked if it would be possible to sit to the right as it was far quieter and was told no it s a table for 4  After asking again and mentioning how quiet they were she went to ask her manager who said it was ok  We were seated with menus and told she d be back shortly The waitress spent a great amount of time tidying several tables and ignoring us  After 25 minutes 9pm  end of shift maybe the waitress was nowhere to be seen so we called over a waiter and asked to place an order for drinks as well as our food order We explained we d be sat for some time to which we received no apology other than a what would you like  Food arrived in reasonable time and I must say was very good for money we googled a 25 off food voucher and was hot and tasty No complaints  During our meal another couple stood some time at the door and after not being seen to sat themselves down on the next table to us After several minutes they asked for menus and after another 10 or so they had to call someone over to take a drinks order After they again mentioned the wait they were told rudely if you sat yourself down that s the reason why nobody s been over and after explaining they had waited and nobody had seated them presumed you sat yourself  After catching the waiter to grab the bill the first thing he asked was how was the service in a very sarcastic tone  Hugely disappointed with the attitude and level of service we received whilst eating at Prezzo  Luckily my partner persuaded me not to complain and for fact I think it would have fallen on deaf ears we left full but wished we had eaten elsewhere  Not good 
negative, On a night out with 15 people over 1 hour and a half for the food to turn up absolutely ridiculous Its not like we turned up unexpected we d actually booked for 15 people turn up and the wait time was ridiculous would not recommend coming here at all 
negative,Friday evening 630pm restaurant about 1 3 full looking forward to Harrys famous fish and chips Waitress seated us in a window position let us with the menus and we awaited her return to order drinks at least 5 minutes go by 10 minutes then 15 still no attention from the table staff despite trying to make eye cintact with several waiters and waitresses Finally we got up and walked out not very impressive considering the place was less than half full Had a much better experience in Weatherspoons a few doors further on 
negative,Well we were hoping for a nice meal We ordered starters 15mins later the waitress apologies saying they didn t have what we ordered so we change our order In the mean time we could hear the waitress apologising to other customers about the wait 30mins still waiting more apologies 1hr 10mins later still no starters and the waitress comes over to say they didn t have any of our main meals left More apologising to other customers When we left the management didn t seem bothered The only good thing is they gave us our drinks on the house I think the new owners of this pub will not be in business for long at this rate I for one will not be going back   
negative, I came for a meal a month ago the food was amazing so we visited again I revisted on the 31 March 2014 the food was terrible I ve had baby food taste better The bar man was really helpful and adviced us on our drinks and the lady on food greeted us nicely and served us in a polite manner The manager returned later that night and we could smell alchol on his breath when being served  please invest in a toothbrush  He left a young bar man unattended whilst drinking at the other end of the bar He was unprofessional and we will not be returning again We were disappointed and recommend people don t go there We would give it no stars but that can t be done 
negative,This establishment has been closed for a couple of months as they have gone out of business  This must be 6 different owners possibly in the same family since it went from being the White House pub  You would think that a new owner would want to try and different food style anything other than Indian but not fish chips 
negative, Went to Leon with the family having always fancied it but never got the chance We went as we had a voucher code but were told they could not accept it as it was for dinner and they don t serve dinner on Sunday It seemed cheap so we opted to stay It really was a sub-sub-Nandos experience The chicken served was greasy and brown - no breast The chicken soup showed no discernible evidence of having met a chicken at all Salads were robust and healthy but mostly seemed to consist of raw broccoli Waffle fries were very greasy The whole meal was served at room temperature apart from the soup which was microwave hot - almost dangerously so when my son had a taste and luckily for him could taste nothing else for the rest of the meal The kids protested and we had to get a bag of chips on the way home  Their slogan is The future of fast food  I fear not 
negative, Visited with my wife and sister recently I chose fish and chips my wife chose steak and was asked if she wanted thick cut chips when the meals were served it was obvious my fish and chips had been frozen and the mushy peas were dry my wife though asked did she want thick cut chips also had been given oven chips my meal cost 7 95 for convenience food I could have cooked at home in fifteen minutes so if you like overpriced convenience food this is the place to visit but I certainly will never return  
negative,Living local and a kind of regular I decided to pop in there on a monday night after getting off a plane from Spain Being used to manana manana I had to wait an eternity for a simple burger When it eventually arrived it was so burnt that it was actually black on both sides and the bun itself was rock hard I told the waiter he must be joking and was told I was being rude I insisted on speaking to the manger and instead got an immature assistant manageress who told me that she did not like my attitude Actually I had 3 staff members ganging up trying to downgrade myself  I was even told that I was not a regular and have never been seen even though myself and family have been going to this pub for many years All I can say is support the real local pubs that are not owned by big corporations and run by staff who think they can take your money and answer you back I thought the customer had rights not in this pub Funny I ask for a complaints form and instead got a survey to fill in How can anything change when they are there just to take your money Good luck
negative, The food was ok at best The service by the staff was ok at best The attitude of the boss was disinterested at best  Thankfully our evening did not hinge on our meal here If it had we would have been very disappointed At best 
negative, Dirty establishment with rude staff and vile food  The liquor is tasteless the pies aren t even mince they re more like dog food  Like the rest of the market shops it s ridiculously over priced  Avoid 
negative, Stopped by for a quick bite Quick - no way 50 minute wait for a cheese toastie and a ploughmans Stroppy answer when complained about the wait Not a pleasant experience 
negative,Eating out in Doncaster as always been bad but this places raises the bar of utter rubbish Bad service felt the waiters were rushing us my niece had not finished but still tried to take her plate away then stood and watched till she had finished and the prices they must be in cloud cuckoo land 5 95 for a few mushrooms in garlic and cream the same for chewy squid the main course was alright but for 15 95 was not at all worth it Was it a bad night on their part I do not think so just people of Doncaster have not a clue about good dining and this place knows it sees you coming serves you utter garbage then robs you blind for the privilege 
negative, I was asked to leave this venue last night I was told I was drunk I d has two pints and my friend who was standing next to me told the guard this I was then told the manager wanted me out I asked why because I was genuinely surprised The guard said a guy in a green t-shirt was causing trouble I pointed out the fact that I was wearing a black and white button down shirt The guard didn t care and maintained it was me He just said his manager wanted me to leave I wasn t too bothered really but I just found this to be very odd treatment Anyways I won t be going back 
negative,not a very welcoming place to visit shop resembles a 1960 s establishment some staff seem to be miserable and a cant be bothered attitude
negative, We went on a saturday night and was busy So as is quite normal were handed a buzzer and pointed to wait in the bar area  We then proceeded to stand there for 10 minutes plus  which seemed more like 30  whilst 1 waitress did table orders and the other served ONE single person She took an eternity to served one couple just 2 drinks and then took a card payment which took an eternity When she came back she rudely shouted whos next and served some guy who was blatantly stood 2 yards back from the bar and was clearly not next I said he was not next and she looked at me to say you should have spoke up   They really should not advise people to wait in a bar and then not be able to even serve them a drink whilst they wait And a bar tender who cannot keep track of who is next is pretty poor  Very poor especially considering also my heavily pregnant wife could not be given some sort of seat or table service for the drink anyway Having an 8 month pregnant lady to stand at a busy bar for over 10 mins is a bit of a crap night out  To boot there was TWO managers stood idle at the front desk greeting people which is not even a full time task You should surely come help on the bar and pop back to the desk as and when   why would you give preference to new customers not yet in the venue instead of those already stood waiting  
negative, I was sitting at a table outside with some friends who work in a pub across the road A guy i knew walked past stopped said hello i asked if he was coming in the pub and he said he couldn t as he was barred he then says bye and walks off A minute later the person i now know is the landlady comes out and say i have to leave I ask why and am refused a reason stating she doesn t have to give a reason My friends say thats unfair and i should least be told a reason but again she refuses then says if i don t leave she will bar the table I raise this with the company who have zero interest whatsoever despite cameras clearly showing nothing occurred except my friend walking past I have never before or since been barred from anywhere and this was the 2nd time i had ever visited this pub I have now heard that she will do this to anyone who is associated with a barred person 
negative, Went in got our drinks then ordered me and my partner got a mixed grill it s was like a child s portion plus we didn t get tomato or onion rings when we brought this up the lady said they don t serve mixed grill with them anymore and walked away telling us if could have ordered them as an extra but if you look on the menu it does say mix grill comes with steak chicken sausage gammon chips mushrooms and grilled TOMATO and ONION RINGS 
negative, After reading all the reviews praising Barnys restaurant did we pick the wrong night we were really looking forward to a good meal of haddock and chips After ordering we waited quite a while before it came to the table On trying to cut through the batter to get to the fish it was like a rock and had obviouslybeen cooked before and put back in the fryer making the batter solid When we finally got into the fish there was just a miniscule piece of fish The chips were no better stodgy and uneatable My wife complained to the young waitress and got our money back Any way next night we went to Jons takeaway round the corner from Lidles best fish and chips we had for a long time allf freshly cooked in front of you 
negative, Went in for cake and coffee  however it was apparent straight away that we d skip cakes after the immediate rudeness of the waiting staff during the drinks order My mother was laughed at for ordering iced tea which they actually did have and when she asked for ice for all of our water they bought two cubes in a glass for the four of us to share Myself and my dad ordered breakfast tea I asked for sweetener for his the waiter said of course we don t have sweetener this is a coffee shop Use the brown sugar  Don t sell tea if you re not prepared to supply white sugar or sweetener For some reason he then took the sugar away before my dad used and we had to go to the counter ask someone less abrasive for more We were treated appallingly like we were a massive inconvenience 
negative, Five blokes five meals and all the extras     ALL COLD Took an age to get it too and it wasn t that busy we complained but they either weren t bothered or didn t understand We won t be going back pity it used to be ok 
negative, tried out buffalo for the first time last weekend we had high expectations but were very dissapointed Went with my son and partner she is oriental and me english the only reason i mention this is because perhaps the staff dont like mixed race relationships firstly i ve never beofre walked into a restauraunt and been ignored by the waiting staff when we got our table and plates were put down i had to tell the waiter that one of the plates was dirty i understand these things happen from time to time and a simple apology would have been fine but no nothing just swapped the plate without a word the food is mediocra at best the worst came when i found a long hair in my food i mentionded it to the staff only to be told very abruptly well none of us have long hair never in all my years have i come across such a bad attitude towards a customer i wasnt after a free meal or even a discount just an apology would have surficed on leaving the restaurant not one staff member said thanks or bye or opened the door for us which in an indian restaurant is the norm ive chatted to a few friends who have all have bad experiences there with the staff and all vow never to return if you want a restaurant aimed prodominantly at muslim non english people then why on earth open it here in the most english part of Luton 
negative, Called here today for lunch It was just after 12noon There were two ladies waiting to be seated ahead of us Well they waited and we waited and eventually I went to seek out a member of staff She said she would be right with us Sadly she wasn t and eventually we left I should add the restaurant was very far from busy Instead we went further up Bridge Street to Urbano32 where we were very well received 
negative, I don t understand at all how people can think this is good Mexican The only possible solution to that conundrum is that it s mostly British people or others who haven t actually tasted good Mexican that think that the gaudy and unauthentic sombreros they give you are fun  Please if you ve ever tried real Mexican food or real Tex-Mex whether in America or Mexico DO NOT GO HERE This place is fake inauthentic and the food is bad bad bad  It s greasy it s oily it s made with low-quality produce and every bite just tastes like they looked it up on Jamie Oliver s website or something  Throw in the ridiculous sombreros the totally un-Mexican staff and this whole place comes together to be a totally fake and unpleasant surprise to anyone looking for genuine Mexican food in London  The only people that can like this place are those that haven t had real Mexican food so please if you know and like Mexican food don t go here  PS It s overpriced too 
negative, Truly bad - the only good thing about it was that the portions were tiny It has really gone down this year compared to last year You can do so much better at 40 per person 
negative, We went here hoping that Gourmet meant what it said but it only applied to the prices Queuing at the counter to order and pay in advance was a bore When the food arrived it was most disappointing The burger was small and burnt the salad was drowned in creamy salad dressing and indigestion seemed imminent so I left the soggy bun untouched The atmosphere was nothing special at all Basically just another mediocre fast-food joint that thinks that it is special It isn t 
negative, There s not really much to say We were booked for 7 30 but didn t eat any food until gone 9pm Had to walk over to the bar to get drinks as asked waiter and even the manager for wine three times but to no avail The staff seem clueless A guy used a tray to carry a bowl of olives all the way across the restaurant then went back and got the bread  they have conversations in Italian whilst they re serving the food  They got my main course wrong Whilst they did offer to knock it off the bill I would have preferred what I ordered but the waiter said the kitchen was very busy and it would probably be about half an hour  to do pasta   I spoke with the manager who was apologetic but to be frank she was running around doing very little  She was one of the people I d asked for the wine  but had forgotten or not chased up the bar  My partner s starter was great mine asparagus was stone cold Main course was ok but nothing special  Overall very disappointing I think you d get better service in pizza express  It s part of a large group of companies and I think they re just running the places into the ground Bank Birmingham which used to be really good is also going the same way with food quality although the service there is still pretty good  I won t be going back It s a shame Beautiful restaurant great atmosphere -but just totally clueless management I have worked in the hospitality industry and I can tell you that decay starts at the top When management aren t giving staff direction and aren t picking up on what is being done wrong then things go downhill The entire service was in a mess -I clocked it as soon as I walked in and just wish I d walked out again Most tables were waiting for ages  Poor 
negative, How can something so right go so wrong   Well this placed USED to be the very best Indian restaurant for miles around For 3 years I visited regularly and never had a bad meal The food was exquisite even though the snarling front of house manager clearly had a preference for fellow community members and something akin to disdain for seating non Indian members in his domain The poor waiters are rushed off their feet and hoardes of people frequent the establishment day in day out This had led to complacency coupled with an unwillingness to admit that the chef has changed  That is the only explanation I can think of - a change of chef for the last 3 visits have been nothing short of pitiful Once - an off day fair enough  twice - maybe we were unlucky but 3 straight visits for cold food along with cold service means that my party will in future vote with our feet - there are plenty of other excellent newer alternatives in the area where the manager doesn t need to undergo plastic surgery in order to manage a smile  Last night the signature lamb chops were once again somehow burnt and cold at the same time and our off the bone meat nearly choked my friend who got a bone stuck in his throat An apology - NO A suggestion to remove the items from the bill - UNTHINKABLE Upon replacing the lamb chops I complained that the rest of the food was now cold and I would not be paying for the lamb so instead of an apology or an offer to re-make the food we are regulars after all  they simply took the dishes away to prove to the chef that the food was not up to standard and reluctantly brought us the bill  All in all a poor experience - the 3rd time in a row - one that could easily have been rectified with a smile and an apology Unfortunately complacency has set in long ago and according to fellow diners if you re looking for somewhere to go on the slide this is a good alternative to the park 
negative,After being hounded by the owner to write a review I thought I would as he said they where the best restaurant in wigan Cheap Nasty tastng food More like an overpriced cafe and thats an understatement Service poor Wedged into a corner listening to the RADIO   I asked for some mint for my lamb and was handed a pot of tesco mint sauce with a teaspoon in it  Some Fine restaurant this is does not know the meaning of the word Stay at home and cook yourself egg chips and peas its cheaper and will definatly mush better I had to put a 1 star as there is nothing less 
negative, My wife and I ate here for the first time on a Saturday night I was surprised that during a festival they still had tables but I was hungry The restaurant is filthy the service is painfully slow and as for the food it is vile I cook myself a lot and that food was microwaved the squid was reheated the sauce on the ribs tasted like it was out of a jar and the scallops were as hard as bullets At the end of the meal we were virtually shooed out of the place by a new waitress who did not speak English so we could not complain Do not ever eat here 
negative, It s pretty on the outside but there s nothing else really Maybe it s all the cuts to the local council or maybe there really isn t anything to begin with but there are no facilities or tour guides or things I just expected to see more there 
negative, I m getting bored of giving this place another and yet another chance to prove that it can produce some sort of consistency All I can say is - I m out 
negative, The food was not good not was the service the starter arrived after the main meals One of the kids meals arrived before everyone else s and the well done steak was still bleeding 
negative, Lovely setting next to the cathedral but the service was poor The person behind the till was rude and demanding there wasn t an understanding of what vegetarian might mean and the scones are ridiculous If your idea of fun is to spoon thick cream into a thimble sized plastic cup which is balanced on a bending plastic tray with a meagre and over priced scone all resting on a sliver of a shelf while being judged by a crass and inflexible service crammed behind the till  then this is the place for you Unnecessary to be unable to be served unless you give a table number when every table is actually empty and we just hadn t chosen where to sit yet Not very welcoming in such a prime place for visitors to Salisbury 
negative, Ive had better at a service station at half the price dont be fooled by the brand its crap Food looks great until you taste it and after 20 pound for what could pass as a value tesco meal you feel like you have been cheated And what ever you do dont complain as your looked down on as a common person give it a miss and save your cash   
negative, Now closed  ceased trading shame  no doubt to be changed to something else might want to delete from site 
negative, This used to be a decent stop off years ago As many others have commented the place feels like a time warp and it s got a 70 s 80 s charm to it  Upon entering and seeing a hygiene rating of 3 out of a possible 5 alarmed me somewhat And also just one couple and a child seated in the massive restaurant should have made us do a runner Again our order was taken and we were subject to the issuing 2 tickets debarcle just give it up you have no customers anyway two breakfasts arrived literally swimming in grease the presentation was non existent and what bit was edible was extremely bland  Here comes the best bit though my dad ordered tomatoes on toast most foodies would know what to expect Plum tomatoes on toast  what did he get One whole tomato cut into slices that was apparently Grilled but it it barely had been shown the pan Unhappy he returned to the pay point and explained that was not what he was expecting and reiterated what he required He duly paid the 50p they required without an apology of what had actually arrived at our table Minutes later another sliced tomato appeared looking very much like the first time  He explained to the waitress chef if you could actually call her that what he required and instead she argued the point he should have asked for tinned tomatoes  Again isn t this supposed to be a farm shop  When his order was finally fulfilled the above person came to our table and slammed the new tomatoes down next to him and stormed off back to the kitchen  Very poor attitude   So as this used to be a popular haunt for people they have obviously voted with their feet and rightly so  Keep heading east there is a McDonalds at the Wisbech turnoff  
negative, They claim to provide gluten free products but put what little they have with products that are not gluten free They offered soup but did not know what thickeners were in it and refused to allow us to ask the chef They do not understand cross contamination Ignorance is no excuse where customers health is at stake They had nothing to offer a person that can not tolerate gluten for health reasons rather than dietary choice 
negative, Come here for an 80th birthday they re was 19 of us we all had bad food we love hungry horse but this is the worst place I ve ever eaten and that s saying something we ve all complained and gotten different money back 
negative,Popped in a few months ago - they had a new chef but weren t serving food at the time - had a look around and thought yes we will look forward to going back Went in this evening car park was busy - good sign thought lets get a drink and decide on our plans Shocked is the only way I can describe the outrageous price we were then charged for drinks  1 70 for a soda and lime You don t even get charged that in the West End  If you have a venue that generally requires guests to have a driver in the party it is unfortunate that you can not get the revenue from expensive drinks - I can understand that but charging such an astronomical amount for lime cordial cost price about 0 05 and water free  is pathetic 
negative, We booked a table for 9pm I had a heard good things about this restaurant from a friend We skipped the starters due to the time and ordered 1 Sticky Rice 1 Pad Thai K Prawn A mixed seafood hot plate & their signature dish Large Tiger Prawns After 50 minutes we watched 1 customer storm out over the quality of the food and service at this point we were thinking about leaving boy we wish we did The rice came out in one LUMP  The SIGNATURE DISH Tiger Prawns were burnt on the outside and raw in the middle the rest of very average After a bite of the slimy Tiger Prawns our stomachs started to turn which were 14 95 by the way We made our complaints known and were refunded the Tiger prawns & rice and the manager then explained that she was having trouble with the microwave heating the rice up If you value your health avoid  We were charged 30 Never again      
negative, Rushed service at one point the waiter clicked his fingers to pass the finished starter Never again better places in chester one to avoid  
negative,Rubbish service rubbish food Everything about this place is rubbish I even found a hair in my food Countless glares from staffmembers Wrong orders brought to the table Customer service is appalling The worst experience ever 
negative,Turned up with 9 friends for my birthday meal and they had lost my booking  They were over booked and could not accomodate us Offered little appology but I booked it 2 weeks before Restaurant looked like queing canteen Went to differerent venue Lost my custom and many others forever 
negative, Went there for a take away last week as I have always used them and has always been good food I have to say this is the first time I ve been since the new ownership and shall not be returning I got the order home to find out that they had got it wrong I couldn t be bothered to go all the way back into kidlington as I was hungry so I decided to eat what I was given  I really wished I had not  the food was bland very tasteless and only Luke warm the next 2 days I suffered from stomachs pains I will not recommend this place to any one again 
negative, while passing I decided to stop for the fixed price breakfast which included tea & bread & butter  I was charged more than what it said on the notice outside but sat & waited for it to arrive after 20 mins I was brought a mug of tea & 2 slices of toast I said I didn t want toast just bread & butter & was told I could have the toast anyway & I would get bread & butter with my breakfast  when my breakfast arrived I asked for the bread & butter & 10 mins later I received another 2 slices of toast  I said I don t want the toast can I have bread & butter  I was looked at as if I was mad then the waitress walked away went back to the kitchen with the toast came back empty handed & stood behind the bar   still no bread & butter  breakfast wasn t all that either 
negative, The food took over 40 minutes to arrive and the so called hot tapas were already cold before they reached the table The first dish which was supposed to be chicken looked like it had been stuck together from other people s left-overs and would not have looked out of place with the vile offerings served up in the celebrities in the jungle programme The lamb steak came already ripped apart so that it wasn t recognisable as steak and was drowned in something resembling a sauce but which stunk to high heaven and tasted twice as bad Unfortunately the manager became very aggressive following our complaint and we left after leaving cash on the table to cover most of the bill 
negative,This place has it all Dirty cutlery horrible Luke warm food poor service & the ambiance of an oil rig canteen  Value for money When I got the bill I didn t know wether to laugh or cry as I was walking away from the place I felt like I had been mugged 
negative, We went to Sawadee on a 15 groupon deal for two starter and main  My wife and I selected the same starter about 6 each and our main course came to about 10 each After taking our order and accepting the offer we were told that it would be 3 50 extra for each main course since we were having duck Then when the bill came another 3 50 had been added because our starter was more expensive than other starters  She even said she was giving us a deal by only charging one extra 3 50 charge  So rather than being a good deal it proved to be only a minor discount and created stress for myself and my wife on what should have been a nice evening out  The service was slow even though there were only six other people in there and very little effort had been put into making it a nice Thai atmosphere Some strange English music was playing the walls were empty the menus were falling apart and the pile of candles sat unlit on a side table  Since the food is good I d say most of the problem is down to bad management If we hadn t felt ripped off I would probably have given it 2 5 5 
negative, Came in on a Saturday It was quiet Clean lovely atmosphere Ordered a pot of tea and a double espresso Pot of tea had 1 teabag in Very weak tea Coffee cup had dried coffee drip stains down the side and along the rim from a previous drink Coffee tasted like water I suspect it was coffee that had been used twice Took the coffee back offered no apology 
negative,I had the misfortune of eating at La Rue on Saturday night The starters went OK but then they brought out only 4 of our 5 meals - about 6 or 7 minutes later the 5th meal arrived but none of our vegetables had arrived We asked for them and got no response from the staff We asked again and everyone ate their meals without vegetables even though we d ordered them We spoke to the staff and said you have only brought out half the meal we d ordered make sure we re not charged for the side order of vegetables We then after 20 mins or so had to ask twice to see the dessert menu They brought us 6 coffess and lookede confused when we were a group of 5 4 of the coffees were fine but one was completely cold and we insisted it was changed for a hot one We were very unhappy at this point and the whole evening had been spolit by unbelieveably poor service We asked for the bill 20 minutes went by and we still hadn t got the bill We asked again irately and they brought the bill On the bill was the side order of vegetables that we hadn t had as they couldn t be bothered to bring them We told them to remove these items from the bill They did this and we paid and left  I couldn t recommend this restaurant to anyone - the whole experience was shambolic and disappointing My advice would be to go somewhere else and have a better time 
negative, After a painfully slow delivery service the barely warm meal arrived what can I say the chicken madras ordered tasted exactly like a tikka massala hold on that s because it was After a short heated discussion with the telephone staff they agreed to send the originally ordered dish Although it did arrive within 15 minutes it would ve taken The Deadliest Catch team to trawl the bottom of the ghee coated gravy slop to recover a single tasty chicken morsel  You wouldn t need a seasoned asian pallet to know this is not a scratch on what Beckenham restaurants have to offer do yourself a favour try something different elsewhere   The Dining Experience  An experienced to be missed 
negative, Arrived 1pm  15 min queue at bar to order 45 min wait for starter 1 hr wait for main - grossly understaffed My chicken mushroom pie was inedible-soggy pastry hardly any chicken content- much better quality at local chippy chips must have been cooked 3x previously- fatty and cold Seasonal vegetables consisted of limp raw cabbage dried up carrots and parsnip Other meals no better fillet steak tasted slightly off chicken breast totally dried out all chips virtually inedible I cannot state enough how disappointed we all were with the meal  Sirloin steaks were fine though there was total confusion over the order For a Sunday Lunch the level of staffing and service was totally unacceptable We will never return there and will recommend friends and colleagues to seek elsewhere to dine  I am aware that meals have to be prepared to a price but nevertheless basics such chips and vegetables should be prepared and presented to an acceptable standard whatever the price Children had to wait nearly 2 hours for service-what should have been a family celebration became a challenging ordeal 
negative, I m a man of few words but unusually this Boozer brings out the need in me to express my findings in great detail Brilliant location nice enough country pub but no way is it anything special decor-wise  its deffo not a trendy gadtro-pub & the prices are mid to high which isn t on given what we experienced was nothing more than reheated deep fried processed frozen food None if this could be overlooked as the service was below parr the welcome from the Landlord was luke-warm & generally we felt as though they couldn t care if we were there or not despite us giving them our business We deffo won t refer Friends & Family & we deffo won t return 
negative, The start wasn t great  this place is in a horrible block of buildings  the kind of place I would expect to order a bacon sandwich No bars or night life nearby to speak off at all  unless you fancy a take away pizza which you might  I arrived to what I thought looked like a cafe  not many in and generally a bit lack lustre I was invited to sit down in an empty restaurant for a drink before the meal I declined that kind offer and asked for a beer  they only serve one btw  warm peroni in a bottle   I shouldn t need to tell them It was warm but I had to I even had to ask that they put 3 4 in the freezer so That I wouldn t have another warm beer  In fairness the girl on her own seemingly worked extremely hard and was very attentive  The food Very good in general as my expectations from the location where not high Small portions where delivered without any explanation of what was in front of you  which wasn t always clear But the quality of the cooking was very good I won t be back and unless you fancy a place with no atmosphere  choice of beers and very little food I wouldn t either  They are however an independent and am sure work tirelessly for their passion they are missing the basics  atmosphere  choice  and a decent drinks menu  
negative, I know we are not in France but if it says steak Frite at least get frites eh when asked the server had no idea at all will not be eating here again 
negative, I ve been to Damons quite a lot and enjoyed it in the past its good for kids foods good and on most occasions the staff have been nice and the wait for food isn t too bad either but won t ever return and the reason is the following  In a big open restaurant with several tables free they sat us right on top of another family which more than likely annoyed them just as much as us so I decided to move a couple of tables down as the restaurant was fairly quiet to give each other space we ordered are food and sat back  in the meantime other tables around me were being taken up with people ordering food after a while I noticed that people who had arrived after me were all getting their food before me after waiting over 40 mins and seeing several people being served before me I asked the girl why my food had not arrived only to be told it s cause you moved seats and ballsed the seating arrangements up  They were actually prepared for me to sit there indefinately waiting for food that wasn t going to arrive because I dared move seats I like picking seats when I go for a meal and not frogmarched to one and told to sit there I had young children with me and they were preapred to take the mik out of me and my family just because I moved seats what type of idiots are these people In the end I had cross words with them insults were exchanged and I left and won t ever go back again which is a shame because I used to go their often 
negative, Saturday afternoon visit Wife + 15 year old Especially picked out this pub due to its history and trying to get some into pub going for when he s old enough Pub was busy inside and also spilled out the front Made it to the bar only to be greeted by rude bar staff shouting across room that kids are not welcome inside Had ordered my pint so we went outside only suggestion made by bar staff as to where we could go no mention of any other inside room for children then outside we were approached every 5 minutes by beggars wanting change will not go back 
negative, Awfull service terribly cooked food and very cramped decor The place has gone massively downhill  Worse than even Weatherspoons The only whing good is the balcony over the harbour not great for January though  
negative, This was one of my worst experiences in a restaurant ever the place had no atmosphere the staff not one of them had a smile at all the food was dumped in front of us and tasteless compared to some good kebab houses around keema nan had some kind of powder not recognisable as keema - what topped it off was there was an extra rice and drink on the receipt - how cheeky the guy who took my order looked me in the eye and conned me - daylight robbery albeit 4 50 but if they did this for 100 tables a week it adds up - nice policy but NEVER AGAIN 
negative, First time I ve ever been refused entrance to a restaurant and it was not even half full The excuse given was we were part of a large group So once again a venue turns down business but judging by some of the other reviews we had a lucky escape We progressed to another venue who were only too happy to have our custom 
negative, I arrived at 11am with my girlfriend to find Acanteen 85 full with people seemingly enjoying their food We found a table sat down and browsed the menu before I went to join the substantial queue at the ordering area  I queued for a total of 15 minutes before I got to the front to be told that the kitchen was being closed as we are busy  I found this beyond belief that a restaurant below full capacity could not cope If the restaurant are ill-prepared they should look to downsize If Acanteen wants to maintain a certain level of respectability they will address this matter After all it was profits and money through the till that was walking out of the door as we had a milkshake each and then left to a nearby establishment which was capable of housing us and many more  On a sidenote the milkshakes were okay 
negative, I wish I had checked on here first Thought you couldn t go wrong with this type of food but how wrong I was Tasteless rubbish avoid this restaurant and hopefully it will go out of business for someone to open a proper food outlet 
negative, We have passed the Trevor Arms many times en route to Glyndebourne and na€Œvely imagined that the local pub of a village adjacent to such an illustrious opera house would be superb in every way Certainly the online menu and food images suggested a feast in store but the reality was quite another matter Having pre-booked for lunch we accessed the building through the back door adjacent to the pub s car park and were immediately struck by an overpowering smell of lavatories Endeavouring to remain positive however we climbed the unwelcoming stairs to the bar to be greeted by a sight of such shabbiness that for one moment we thought we had entered the wrong building But no this was indeed the Trevor Arms  an establishment in truly desperate need of a major decorative overhaul bereft of any vestiges of charm or cosiness In fact given that the pub had already been open for over half an hour when we arrived on an icy November day there was a distinct chill in the bar and the radiators were stone cold When we and an American customer asked whether some heating could be provided the barman lit a single wood-burner which the 3 of us huddled around at adjacent tables but it gave off very little heat despite some additional coaxing We had carrot and ginger soup as a starter  quite the most tasteless concoction we have ever encountered akin to eating a bowl of bland unseasoned pur€÷ed carrots submersed in flavourless hot water We struggled through in hopeful anticipation of a better culinary experience with the main course but our choice of wild mushroom risotto proved an unmitigated disaster the only discernible flavour being saltiness in the extreme After morosely poking this gelatinous gunge for a couple of minutes we returned our plates to the bar in disgust pronounced the risotto to be completely inedible paid for what we had consumed and left Readers of our reviews will know that we generally find something positive to say about the majority of eateries we visit but we can find not one redeeming feature in the Trevor Arms that would persuade us to return to this establishment ever again It was truly awful 
negative, the afternoon tea was very poor if you are Gluten free I rang up and spoke to the manager about my wife allergies and they said they can do us afternoon tea we were greeted with a couple salad sandwiches and a side bowl of roasted vegetable for her no cakes etc I don t have any allergies so mine was ok not great came out in bits and pieces and I alerted the manager owner I had no jam or cream they came back with jam and cream cheese  I spread it and had a bite out of the scone to my horrible taste it was cream cheese and I then told the owner about it his response was thanks for letting me know he didn t apologise or anything and then return with some cream I found the owner rude and customer service wasn t at all anywhere good enough for the money it cost I then wrote to the restaurant and they said they would respond in 24 hours and its now 3 weeks later with no respond 
negative, We were a party of five who visited the tollgate for Sunday lunch today and were very dissapointed with the food Four of us had the Sunday roast two having pork and two choosing the beef My roast beef dinner consisted of three slices of pre roasted beef that had been reheated in gravy which was served on top of a dollop of mashed potato the vegetables were virtally non existant a couple of broccolli florets three or four small pieces of carrot and one yes one only small roast potato the size of a small brussel sprout and to add insult to injury everything was barely lukewarm one of our party had pork which actually was still pink inside that may be acceptable for beef but definately not for pork After complaining to managment who gave the impression that our complaints werent justified he did knock 10 percent from the bill I am a regular visitor to Bury St Edmunds visiting family and always dine out but the tollgate will be avoided in the future 
negative, It s not often you can say a carvery is massively overpriced at 10 but a plate of dry veg with a tiny piece of meat should never cost this much The restaurant as a whole was poorly managed I came close to walking out Unfortunately this restaurant relies on passing trade so if you re reading this it s probably too late to avoid but be sure to tell others heading to York 
negative, Really looking forward to the meal this evening first time at Nandos and heard that it is very popular After a forty minute wait where we were told that we could not have drinks other than water we were seated at the table I took the written list of our order and engaged in a conversation with the guy behind the till only for him to answer the phone and walk off Um excuse me I m here and actually talking to you I find this extremely rude and would have walked out at this point but I had guests with me which stopped me from doing so So I finally placed my order specifically asking for a plain butterfly chicken in a Portuageese roll This seemed to be more arduous than the ninth task of Herculese being told that the menu is difficult for first timers I want to order dinner not study for a PhD  We were then permitted to help ourselves to drinks The starter was fantastically overpriced for four slices of garlic bread When the main arrived it was with courteousy however the plain butterfly chicken was doused with mayonnaise So even after having it written down the order placed before a phone call re-placed after the interruption and then reiterated then confirmed by the waiter and reconfirmed by myself it was still wrong when delivered to the table The minuscule ramakin of chips that cost a staggering 2 50 were not cooked properly but consumed hungrily during the yet further wait for another overpriced piece of chicken in a bun to be delivered This came with an apology but no salad so a further scuttle back and forth produced a solitary green leaf and a disk of tomato The food was of no great standard what with the undercooked frozen chips the so called Portugeese roll or bun for short and lacklustre salad The desert was ordered only for a waitress to return to deliver the news that the order could not be fulfilled due to lack of necessary rations Alternatives were chosen and these came promptly The majority of the staff had left for their own evening meal by the time we were leaving and we were hailed across the hot and noisy resteraunt with a goodby see you again  Yeah goodbye but no not see you again  That was my first and last time in a Nandos  A pathetic starter a simple chicken in a bun not delivered as ordered an expensive and minimal portion of undercooked frozen chips and a desert that had to be re-ordered  I was really looking forward to eating here but left frustrated disappointed and with the moths in my wallet with only a solitary tenner to chomp on But at least it s what they ordered and they are happy enough Just not good enough by far 
negative, Chose cheese and chutney baguettes   no baguettes  Settled for sandwiches Charged us 9 80 for 2 sandwiches made with supermarket bread and cheap cheese We tend to put quality before price and thought that for a fiver a piece the sandwiches would be decent quality Should have gone to the supermarket opposite and bought a couple of their sandwiches We won t be going to Coffee etc again suggest you don t either if you expect value for money 
negative,I have been to the Puss In Boots on numerous occasions both to eat and sometimes just for a drink I have always found the staff really friendly and nothing seems to be to much for them to do for you Which is why I was really upset earlier this week The lovely smiley blond girl in a black top who is always friendly was admonished I d rather use a much ruder word in front of the customers by the tall smart bloke with curly hair  I think he is one of the owners  You could see she was really upset and virtually in tears I find it totally appalling when this happens in public surely it could have been dealt with at another time If this is an example of the Almond Family way of working I shall not be going to any of their pubs again It was disgusting behaviour reducing someone to tears in front of customers I have sent Robinsons a copy of this review From an ex customer
negative,Over priced poor service and awful tapas This place really can t do Spanish Tapas visited here on a couple of occasions and left disappointed portions small and over priced 
negative, We went for evening meal on a Thursday Overall the food was good but expensive The cheapest main was 13 50 for the veggie option  The real issue was the service and arrogance of the place Firstly we were not shown to our tables and instead just told were to find it by the landlord I then asked a question about if a particular meal came with potatoes and was greeted with a response of they come with what it says on the menu having not eaten there I was trying to understand if I needed to order extra but after further questioning still got a very unfriendly response  The food tasted good but was overpriced by 2-3 per dish they also needed extras which would again increase the cost Scampi was 15    When we had finished our meals they took the plates with out so much as a pleasantry and then when I paid the landlord hardly said a word and I felt like it was a transaction to him He then left a card asking for a trip advisor review as if he was very confident that they were an amazing experience  Customer Service was shocking decor was 15 years past it s sell by the food was good but overpriced and I have eaten better at 2 3rds the price   
negative, Very slow service Staff did not care and despite delays were disinterested  Had to leave to top up meter because of time waiting Prices up  Service down nice decor but a poor experience Bring back cafe plaza would not recommend this restaurant 
negative,11 us us went as it was my sisters 56 Birthday  we waited and waited for are food to arrive when it did they shoudent have botherd the chips were unedable as were the soggy onion rings non of us finished the meal we will never set foot in The Astoria again 
negative, After driving up high street late one night decided to try Bennys  The family had eaten so was just feeding myself I love fish and chips but the quality of the food here was not great at all Chips were greasy and all stuck to bag I liken it to eating mashed potato The batter on the fish was not cooked really soggy and not the white flakes of fish I would expect Staff were pleasant enough but did take a while for them to acknowledge me really annoys me  Definitely better chippy s in town just a shame my regular one chippy s was closed  
negative,It was a lovely day so we sat outside unfortunately my pint of becks was spoiled by a dirty beer glass We then ordered food my partner a salad and me a steak sandwich with chips The food came promptly and the waiter offered salt and pepper but no sauces or vinegar My steak was full of gristle which meant taking pieces out of my mouth after each bite of the sandwich Of course if it was on the plate I could have seen which parts to remove but if you make a steak sandwich then it should be gristle free since you have to eat it blind Moving on to the chips these were hard and oil crisp - overcooked and tasteless hence I had to go and find some vinegar I would no go back here 
negative, Don t go here  the worst service and thing I ve ever eaten The rating i ve given is generous  i d rather starve  crap 
negative,I quite often pop in here for my lunch great staff nice food and reasonably priced The take away counter is also very efficiently run and service is speedy 
negative, Pizza is ok but the service experience was terrible I kept waiting over 20 minutes for my take-away order When I asked it was clear that they messed up the order And then I kept waiting another 8 minutes And when I was asking again they didn t apologise Instead they were amused and laughing at me And then one guy made inappropriate comments in Italian accent about the fact that I ordered 2 Pizzas just for me alone and was commenting in profane language on my weight I have some overweight  I asked to cancel the order and to get my money back but they rejected my request Eventually after over 35 minutes I got my 2 Pizzas In the meantime also other customers had been paying attention to my case They were very amused and some of them also were making disrespectful comments about my overweight And the people from the staff were also openly mocking me and laughing This was a very humiliating experience I went home with my Pizzas but had no joy in eating them Never ever again I will enter this horrible place where they did something so bad to me 
negative, I dont want to harp on with a long report  Food in edible  we left without paying  family in front of us did the same and two behind us also left  perhaps a bad day  Food pre prepared from  bookers  3663 or brake brothers  just rubbish  Staff un interested  manager wouldn t even come out of the kitchen to speak to us  left phone number  no one called It was never going to be cordon blu but to be avoided even my kids sussed it was rubbish 
negative, Took family here for lunch as it was good weather after reading on web site Sat drown about 1pm went to bar to order food and was told there would be 1 hr wait to be served I said are you sure and I was told yes I go to a lot of places with family and have never had to wait more than 15 min for food 1 hr was just a joke so left next time here in shielded I will not be coming here  too long 
negative, I usually eat here once a week but after today never again  New owner has taken over and hes really unhygenic and useless  Ordered an egg sandwich and a panini it took 20 minutes after he said it would be 10 Between preparing my food he was cooking other customers egg and bacon using his hands to touch the meat and never once washed his hands the whole time I was there Panini was ready after 10 minutes but was left in the panini maker for a further 10 minutes until he cooked the egg 10 minutes to prepare an egg sandwich   After touching my food with his dirty hands and 20 minutes later he served me a rock hard and squashed overcooked panini and an egg on the wrong bread and to top his awful customer service off didint offer me a bag to take them away Avoid unless you want possible food poisioning 
negative,We were passing by and thought it might be nice to sit on the terrace and have something to eat and drink even though the prices were on the high side compared to the other places nearby When our food arrived it wasn t very warm I ate about half of mine but it had started to get too cold to enjoy I took it back to the manager who was serving behind the bar  he questioned me about how long I had waited for it to be served then said he would refund me half the price of the meal There was no apology and I got the feelling that he wasn t bothered about any customer satisfaction this was my first time at this establishment and it will be the last There are a lot better places to eat in Bridlington and i recommend that you avoid this place 
negative, My wife and I visited Real China in Camberley last week I never normally go to buffet type restaurants and truly wish I hadn t bothered breaking from my belief that most of these type of restaurants serve poor quality cheap food The dishes we tried were tasteless and unappealing Sauces were thin and watery without any substance for instance the satay sauce I tried was nothing more than a tasteless khaki fluid The starter type dishes were either oily dried out or both  To sum up my wife and I ate almost nothing drank our drinks paid 35 and left This is the worst eatery I have ever had the displeasure to eat in 
negative, The food here was very poor indeed I had a Lamb Vindaloo - the sauce lacked flavour the meat was gristly and was swimming in grease The sides were no better dry rice and an overcooked naan only added to the disappointment  The d€÷cor surroundings were forgettable and the service was neither good nor bad - nothing here to drag the rating up 
negative,I visited Scoffers on June 8th 2012 I got a walm welcome although a little over powering  I ordered a steak  I do suspect it was frozen I did eat it as I was very hungry but really it was only fit for my dog I told my waitress that I thought it had been frozen  with a big smile she stated that all their meat was fresh  no way it was awful and at 24 with a glass of wine a rip off  so if you want to eat like a dog Scoffers is for you     Roger
negative, Wow this place really is horrific From idiotic doormen kicking around rubbish outside to a vile and nasty staff member actively heckling customers in the lifts - a truly terrible experience  I had made a reservation for Sushi Samba a few months ago and was rather looking forward to the evening However despite my reservation we were placed in the darkest deepest corner of the restaurant with blinds pulled down blocking any natural light  I thought I was meant to be 39 floors in the sky not 39 floors in the ground  When I requested to move I was told that the other tables - which were empty - had been reserved   strange given the fact I had made a reservation for a window table  Indeed the staff member proceeded to put his arm around me and offer an even worse alternative Please get your hands off me I am not your friend and don t want you to touch me  Enough was enough we had to walk out 5 minutes into our visit  I honestly can t believe how atrocious this place is Not only were the staff in all sections of the venue odious and ignorant but the venue resembles a teenage pool party in Ibiza  In future train your staff appropriately and add a bit of class to the venue Terrible   PS One star is far too generous wish I could give this mockery of a restaurant zero stars  A response and apology from senior management would be the least that you could do  
negative, Got fish and chips prety sure that the fish was pangasius watery with two fish to make up a potion it was bloody awful Dont bother 
negative, This place has a food and hygiene 0 rating people read the reviews and think that we either had a bad time and pick a place and slate it this place is awful the staff are in helpful moody the food is awful it needs new people in this did used to be a lovely place but hey things change the peeking house just around the corner is owned by the same people but the food there is OK so how can they get it so wrong in the evening palace 
negative, We went as group of 4 last night just for the dining experience since the dining room pride itself with the Michellin 1 star quality food However I have to say that our surprise tasting dinner menu turns out to be a complete surprise to us as it is indeed the worst meal I have had in my life starting from the appalling service to the inadequate quality quantity and variety of food served  The reception drinks and canapes were a good start of our evening and probably the only good bit of the evening A relaxing atmosphere in the recption when we walked in seating areas was nicely decorated and comfortable Attandences come around pretty quickly to take our order and serve giving us a good start before it all went down hill  We have all ordered the surprise tasting menu  85 without drinks as we thought it will give us what it s best of the menu The first is an appetiser which is a celery cream soup served in a double espresso cup I have had a few tasting menu myself in my life and a small cup of soup really cannot be called an appetiser not even on a normal menu The taste of the soup itself was bad as well as about half of it is cream so all we can taste is the sweetness of the cream Decorated with a very sour strip of pickled celery that makes our eye watered when we put it in our mouth The combination was badly thought through and started to give us the impression that the chef hasn t tasted what he she cooked  The the starter comes two strips of foie gras which tasted like strict from the can or the chef has overblended it so much with air and cream leaving no texture and taste of normal foie gras The sad thin piece of smoked duck breast was added onto the plate for no good reason at all as it adds nothing to teh plate If two strips of foie gras and one piece of duck breast are what they are attempting to achieve for the variety that should appear on a tasting menu plate they failed completely  What s more  there are raspberry redcution and one and a half pieces of fresh raspberry to complement the dish Where s my other half of the raspberry The dog got to it  With our disappointment we then moved onto the fish course  lobster and tomato salad    two pieces of pouched lobster and tomato three way sliced tomatoes of three variety tomato foams and tomato jelly  I would really love for the chef to explain what makes tomatos and lobster go so well together that he she think nothing else is needed on the plate Seriously not even acceptable as a normal salad in a normal menu  And definitely not passable as the fish course  really tomato adn lobster salad on a non-chilled plate  Main course was one of the more normal dish thanks goodness  Deep fried lamd chop with stewed veal plated together which tasted nice but together being less than the size of my palm The lack of quantity on the plate throughout the entire meal is best demonstrated here really we had to pay for this as a main course If they are trying to pass this sad demonstration as the tasting menu main course please note that simply by putting pieces of well cooked meats on a plate really doesn t warrant the title  I guess you can tell that if we are not at all impressed by this point especially topped with the terrible service that we have been recieving throughout the eveing eg one of the staffs doesn t even know where the bloody toilet is   but more of that later We are all hoping that the sweet courses might lift our mood up a little bit  Well not sure    The pre-dessert was a piece of concentrated passion fruit curd with chilled vanilla cream and nothing else  Really curd with cream that can be finished in four spoonful is our pre-dessert  The dessert itself is the only course that resemble what should appear on a tasting menu  A combination of coffee creme caramel brownie and white chocolate ganache which all tasted quite nice The variety of taste and quantity meet the standard unfortunately not the quantity  My creme caramel looks like it had tripped adn failed down the stairs before landing onto my plate and the brownie looks more crumbs that had been left on the plate by mistake I don t know at which restaurant is this accpetable but when I order dessert I expect a complete dessert not half not a quarter and certainly not crumbs      Finally we thought coffee and petit four cannot go wrong and we will at least have a good finish that can hopefully erase most of the bad memory We are once again nastily surprised  I have ordered a lady grey tea which I know is uncommon but please ask and find out if you don t know it They had gone away form the table thinking it is a variety of coffee and the manager had to come back to clarify The coffee themselves tasted like from the nespresso machine  Seriously Even my 3 starbuck coffee are freshly grounded  And I pay 85 for this dish water I am not going to elaborate on the taste  as dish water really summed it up maybe the machine mal-function that day too  With the petit four the chef once again demonstrated his her lack of knowledge in food If you are unsure about what the name of dish means please at least google or wikipedia it because it will quickly tells you that petit four literally means small oven and had three varities glazed baked or salty Ours fitted into none  Two pieces each of Super-sour lemon marshmellow chocolate truffle tiny bit of pineapple cake brownie again  and store-bought cut-up piece of quince I am not going to waste time on telling you how bad they tasted but what are we suppose to do with two pieces of different sweet between the four of us Cut it up with a knife like one of the waiters suggested Yes they had the nerve to offer us a knife to cut up the sweets when we ask what are we supposed to do with the pitiful plate                This is just glimse of the terrible service we had been having through our entire evening  Our drinks order was not taken at all and bottled water magically being poured without asking The lack of knowledge is demonstrated with the location of the toilet   with the coffee selection  well the normal coffee   espresso   you know   and they seems geniuely surprised and out of their depth when I ask what is on our plate Yes I had to ask instead of being offered to explain what we are eating in our surprise menu Then there are the usual smugs on the china spilling of water by them of course and the general unfriendliness of the serving staff What s worst is when I reflect all these comment on service to the managing staff while trying to contain my anger I was told that the staffs are all new and in training    so we are your practice dummies and we suppose to eat up this terrible excuse along with the rest of the terrible food They then go on explaining that the michellin 1 star is for the quality of their food instead of the service adn experience as a whole  I gave up They take off all the drinks from the bill which was a nice gesture but I really emplore everyone including the affs after reading this post if this experience warrant the 85 I paid I personally think NOT 
negative, My wife & I were desperate for a quick snack after touring Cornwall so called in to Walkers in Padstow at about 5 30 one midweek afternoon in April 2013 I asked for a cheese & onion pastie but was told that they were sold out so chose a traditional one with chips My wife had the same They must have been in the warmer for hours because the chips were lukewarm dry & limp The pasties were the same & very poor quality with gristly meat We both left half of our meals which is unheard of The ambiance was very drab with metal chairs & plastic tablecloths The coffee was OK but the memory of the food still makes me shudder 
negative, Food not good as well as being over priced Male toilets dirty that involved a walk through food storage area  Fresh food stored outdoors and staff rude Need I say more 
negative, Such a disappointment The food here is great and reasonably priced but the service lets it down A group of six of us arrived at 12 45 on Sunday It was dead there were two other tables at the time We were seated no problem drinks were ordered and arrived within 5mins Great It all went down hill from here Our order was not taken until 30mins later after asking if our order could be taken 45mins passed and still no sign of food We politely asked one of the staff to check our food order and he went to check in the kitchen he returned 5mins later stating the reason for the delay was because we were a big group 6 people is big and because two members of our party were ordering Dim Sum as a main This would have been okay if we were informed of this when our order was taken Also just to note Dim Sum is STEAMED food it does not take 45mins  The food finally arrived 10mins later and it tasted great After the meal we waited a further 25mins before 3 of our plates were cleared the other plates were left on the table we were never asked at any stage if a we wanted more drinks b if everything was okay and c if there was anything else they could get for us ie deserts  Not to mention there was also no apology at any stage  It was not busy There were more than enough staff to accommodate Staff seemed disinterested in every task they undertook Safe to say we will think twice about returning here 
negative, Booked about 3 weeks prior for 7 adults and 2 children for lunch on a Saturday we had a warm welcome from the young man who directed us to our table The service is not the best though the staff are polite its slow and you have to ask for more drinks The food is overpriced and not the best quality the chips look like they have freezer burn and the vegetables are cooked within an inch of life The childrens menu selection is as expected nuggets and chips etc but to charge 7 95 is ridiculous and 2 20 for a fruit shoot The worst thing about the whole visit in heavy wind and rain was the fact that no one at booking stage i left my mobile number or on arrival informed us that the toilets where in a portacabin outside i understand that refurbishments need to be completed but the very least you could do is inform customers spending good money  Never again i would suggest looking for an alternative place to eat 
negative, Nice new decor - very bright and airy Staff still pleasant but the food - hungry when I left  The starters were good and the salad cart was - well salad  Mains were not so good Ignoring the fact we got the wrong extras and the onion rings were a bowl of stone cold fatty batter the meat was so bad neither of us ate it My mixed grill had some horrible white meat I think possibly chicken and I resorted to entertaining myself experimenting to see if the beef would actually bounce nearly if you are interested  It was supposed to be medium but instead I got a piece of rock hard dry dry dry dark brown stuff - maybe the hoof We were experimenting to see if the refit had helped any with one of our local fast food joints Fraid not It seems they are still serving up road kill A shame given the venue and the staff 
negative,I come here most lunchs for a guiness with friends and often eat a deli deal Usually mediocre these meals are great for the price  Today however my experience was disastrous My chicken wrap had stale hard bread on the edges and the chips were so hard I could have hammered nails in with them I was half tempted to take the chips away for scientific tests as they may have been useful for bullet proof vests The waiter who saw these came with a fresh plate of chips for me as my appetite had gone a refund would have been preferable but nevertheless a great gesture on his part 
negative,So everyone knows this pub is closed down & dining has been shut for 4 months  This would be misleading if it were to stay up misinforming people who travel to country locations just to fond its closed
negative, I had lunch at an outside table today with a business colleague  We ordered fish and chips and steak frites  The fish was deep fried in batter and was clearly bought in frozen and ready battered The chips were soggy and not fresh The fillet steak was grisly and accompanied with frites from a frozen bag It was laughable that the garnish was half a small grilled tomato  Drinks consisted of a bottle of Thatchers cider and a bottle of water The bill came to 66 pounds including a 12 5 service charge added to the bill I paid by debit card and the waiter wanted additional service His manner was insulting when I refused Avoid this place at all costs 
negative, We had a groupon voucher to use at no 29 for two people with Panini coffee and cake Very small place with only about five tables and four stools by window so shouldn t take long to take an order Well WRONG  ------After our order was finally taken we waited for our coffee for around ten minutes then after it arrived we drank our coffee and waited and waited then after 20 minutes a table that arrived after us had their food delivered still waiting 10 minutes after that we told them we would have to take or food out as only had 1 hr on car meter waited another ten minutes after that to get food with no apology from staff  This place is a joke and the staff terrible with customer service 
negative,This is one restaurant were we never actually got to taste the food as everything had run out  that wasn t the main problem it was how we were treated because of that  Arrival at the restaurant did start off too good either firstly no one was there to greet us secondly we were met with a look of disgust from one of the diners sat with her husband We were a party of nine however we were a group of professionals out for a team dinner  not a stag hen party  Once we finally got sat down there was no pleasantries or welcomes just a polite waitress who had the hard job of telling us what wasn t available on the menu so it s begins  Only one fillet steak no lamb no posh burger only 2 fish of the day  ok so we thought lets try the other alternative The final straw came when we all ordered and then were told they only had 5 crab starters left so two people will have to change  It was an easy decision we decided to leave The embarrassing point is that not one manager or senior member of staff bothered to come over and stop us ask us what was the matter or offer any alternative The question we wanted to know was why on a race weekend with the knowledge they had a party of nine in they didn t plan in advance Secondly the restaurant was not full and those that were in were couples who maybe didn t like the look of us  All was not lost we ended up finding a fantastic restaurant near the Minster called Bennetts who will be getting a 5 star rating So it s the Ivy s loss and their gain  The Ivy is one place I will not be going back to to try the limited menu  
negative, I ordered a BBQ Chicken and Bacon sandwich which took a while to come When it came I was appalled by the standard of food The sandwich came on what I think was value bread and was cut unevenly There was enough BBQ sauce on the sandwich to supply the whole of the pub which was just soaking into the already rubbish bread I would expect to make this sandwich myself not have it provided for me from a chain of pubs Awful and terrible experience 
negative, Decided to go here during gay pride this weekend as there was a sandwich board outside advertising an ostrich or kangaroo burger with chips for 5 Thought this was great value and would be a nice change form the burger vans on the streets It was an absolute con though They were no chips served with the burger at all despite the manager saying there was when we went in and asked about it No burger bun which I was fine with as it is a mongolian restaurant after all but in the end all we had was a burger chopped up in a bowl with some onions  not exactly the great bargain we had expected The false advertising and poor quality food was not the worst thing though I have to say the service and attitude from the manager on duty was the worst I have ever experience We politely requested a discount because there were no chips with the burger which was advertised on the boards outside yet he was rude and acted like we should have nothing to complain about as we had vegetables with the burger I reminded him that we the onions I got with my burger I also would ve got if I had got my burger from one of the vans outside He did eventually agree to a discount on the burgers but then when we asked for the bill all he did was told us the total and there was no written bill which for some reason he couldn t wouldn t produce so we weren t even sure if he was fiddling the drinks prices to make up for the discount he gave us on food We left the money in the middle of the table for at least 10 minutes but he never even bothered to collect it then as we got up to leave he grabbed my arm firmly as if stopping me to leave and said in a rude voice Where s the money  Then there wasn t even an apology when I pointed to it lying on the table Don t go here Worst service I have EVER encountered 
negative, The phone lines were down- therefore cash only  We arrived by taxi  13 to discover this The staff initially ignored us one more or less stomped about sulkily When we were eventually spoke to and explained our situation there was a grunt disguised as an apology I challenged the staff about contacting us as we d made a reservation and one staff member lied saying a colleague tried to contact everyone  His face faltered throughout the lie and he looked away avoiding eye-contact  There wasn t even an attempt to make it up to us E g A free drink We ordered another taxi and left  26 later we arrived back at the airport hotel furious  Never again 
negative, After getting many recommendations from earlier in the year we decided to visit here yesterday for a family birthday 12th July 2012 and I have to be honest everything was mediocre at best   The service was slow and quite detached  no real passion   The food was pricey but having heard good reviews from lots of other people we decided to ignore the prices and just order what we wanted the meat platter starter was slung together with no real attention and the mains were just bland and tasteless  Not at all what we expected The glasses and napkins were quite dirty and when this was mentioned to the waiting staff they simply stared at us as if to say well what do you want me to do about it  The bill was quite high but as I said previously we wouldn t have minded if the food was as good as it s been advertised word of mouth etc to be  I shall not be going here again NOR buying into the Jamie Oliver brand any more  
negative, Tried the restaurant as been past many times and thought it looked nice Went on a Monday evening and there were a few folks drinking smoking outside but only 2 tables occupied inside and one of those were on desserts so we didn t think we d have to wait too long Unfortunately we were wrong  As others have said there are no starters available so we ordered mains both off the specials board Unfortunately these took over 50 minutes to arrive which if they had been fresh cooked & piping hot we could have overlooked however they were only luke warm and the home made chips were clearly bought in from a chip shop and microwaved My main course was supposed to be chicken in a mushroom and mustard sauce however there were no mushrooms which when I managed to find a waiter to question I was told after a 15 minute wait that the chef had forgot to put them in  That was it No apologies just a shrug of the shoulders and off he went After taking this up with another member of staff and eventually the landlady we got the same response just shrugged shoulders On our way out we commented that we d sat there for another 30 minutes after our meal and not been asked if we wanted dessert again just blank looks So although I can excuse a mistake I can t excuse the fact that no one at the Queens Head actually cared one little bit No apology no offer of recompense just nothing So paying over the odds almost 10 per main for pub grub which was reheated and incorrectly made that no one could care less about isn t for me 
negative, I have recently had a meal at The Norton Tavern to celebrate a member of staff getting a new job Although the place itself is very inviting due to its refurbishment the meal was shocking The food was cold throughout the worst being the mash which there was very little of anyway I certainly will never be returning and would never recommend this place to anyone 
negative, My girlfriend and I went here on the 26th september as we had seen an offer of 50 off the total food bill which sounded like an excellent deal  It s a nice location minutes from the racecourse so not hard to find  When shown our table we ordered drinks which came promptly The menu looked like it had a nice selection of food and there was a special board too My girlfriend went with the ribs to start followed by the wall burger at 15 I went with the cheesy garlic bread and the BBQ plank from the specials board which was priced just short of 20 As it was 50 off we both thought it was a bargain  The starters arrived and I have to say the garlic bread was one of the best i ve ever had it was delicious My girlfriend on the other hand struggled with the tough and overcooked ribs If you compare the ribs to that of Hickories even the dog would ve struggled with them Luckily  I had the joy of sampling them as they were part of my main course  The mains arrived and to say they were poor was an understatement The BBQ plank consists of  -pulled brisket - which was overcooked and lathered in the sweetest of bbq sauce -chips - not even seasoned  -Chicken wings - with soggy skin -A sausage - quite nice but most probably bought in -BBQ beans - highlight of the dish if there ever were one -pork belly - no crackling due to not being rendered down in the slightest overcooked and bland I presume the crackling was so spongy it must have soaked up the flavour of the whole dish  see pic as to how spongy  In all fairness The Wall burger didn t look to bad but had we been charged full price we would ve felt hard done by  The waitress came to clear the plates and asked the obligitory question how was your meal I pointed out the spongey pork belly to which she said Is it not your thing At that point we both knew the chef was unlikely to receive any feedback although I did leave feedback on the card provided with the bill  We both agreed it was the worst meal we d ever had out in Chester and that we d decline the dessert menu make a swift exit and look elsewhere  All in all I d only go back if I had the garlic bread for all 3 courses the food was that poor 
negative, We ordered our food at the bar and 3 items on the menu we ordered were unavailable including a curry on curry night  Nevertheless we ordered our food and sat down with some drinks we waited 40 minutes for our food at this point we approached staff at the bar and they said or order hadn t been sent through to the kitchen despite a waitress telling us it would take 5 minutes 15 minutes later our food came out unsurprisingly our orders were wrong We were offered a free round of drinks and complimentary desserts for the cock up funnily enough the desserts took 30 minutes to come as we were getting up to leave they brought them out so we had them The waiter said I believe there was an issue with one of the desserts we were not made aware of this so we were left with 3 desserts Overall a horrendous evening will not be returning but would recommend the Lea Gate Hungry Horse other side of Preston on the A road definitely a much better HH 
negative, This place is without doubt the worst in store coffee shop cafe I have ever visited I was with my wife and her mother shopping and my Father in law and I thought we would have a cup of tea whilst we waited for the ladies   What a mistake The whole concept of quality and customer service is not present at this place Don t get me wrong please it s not that we set our sights too high I mean what s difficult about a coffee and a sandwich I ll list the two main problems    « poor rude staff  chatting between themselves and appeared uninterested   « poor quality drinks and food stale If this passable retail store don t want to drown in this departments disgraceful performance they need to close and rebrand the facility and relaunch it Come to think of it however I try I can t find one good point  
negative,Bought vouchers from Groupon for the Taster Menu  which was not as we expected We were sat a our table for 25 mins having arrived on time with not even a drink to keep us happy The surroundings were less than appealing Sat in a conservatory with slippery tiled floors and placed at a table adjacent to the toilets The service was appalling Left with the wrong menu then asked  white red or rose  When finally presented with the Taster menu having been criticised for not stating this we found the menu to be limited with only a choice of 2 starters one of which had a 3 supplement and 2 mains - again one of which had a 7 supplement - how can this be classed as a Taster  We left before we had placed a food order and I m sure were not the first to walk out of this establishment Very disappointing We eat out in Southport regularly but wil not be visiting this restaurant again 
negative,Went here with a large group of about 9 family members although there was only 4 variations of meals as many of us had the same meal as others in the group We then queued for ages to just order our food and get drinks We were told bluntly that we would be waiting AN HOUR for our food Naturally we would have gone then but as we were in large group we decided to wait it out other places we had been generally over estimate waiting time An hour and a quarter later we went up to complain as food hadn t arrived and we were not alone The queue behind us were all disgruntled customers some people waiting between an hour and an hour and 3 quarters We were told it would be 5 more minutes it was 10 at least And what s more there was no apology from on the till or the waitresses who eventually brought the average food along Don t go there for food you ll be waiting half your life 
negative, Just been to the Blundell arms with the Mrs for a Sunday roast All I can say is that I m disappointed to say the least Now when I think of a roast I think a decent amount of meat a generous serving of veg a Yorkshire pudding some proper roasties and maybe even some mash all topped off with a generous smothering of gravy When I think of a roast I think of the ones my Mrs makes  On arriving at the Blundell we were seated relatively quickly On sitting at the table we were given 2 very presentable menus one being the normal menu and the other being the menu for the roast dinners We went to the Blundell for a roast so quickly went about reading the roast menu We were greeted with the idea of promising food For example it stated that we would get goose fat roasted potatoes an exceptional Yorkshire pudding  something along these lines  and buttery seasonal veg You then moved on to your meats and your tempted with the choice of roast beef turkey and pork or a trio of roast A TRIO OF ROAST  Who doesn t want a trio of roast There were also other options such as slow cooked pork belly lamb or beef If that doesn t get the mouth watering I m not sure what will  That is unfortunately where the good stops We were asked if we were ready to order and we both asked for a trio of roasts and were told that they didn t have any left This is fair enough I understand restaurants run out of certain things from time to time So we went for the roast beef we love a bit of roast beef We didn t have to wait too long before the disappointment came to the table I can only describe what was on the plate as pitiful Please note my earlier comments about what I think when I think of a roast I don t really expect to see too much of the plate before I start eating  Well what was wrong with it your probably asking Well I ll tell you I m not sure who they have in the kitchen but i think they need to go out one Sunday to another pub and learn the definition of a roast  or just read this  There were 2 slices of beef a piece of unbuttery cauliflower a small handful of unbuttery carrots a bog standard Yorkshire pudding and 3 roast potatoes which being honest weren t any better than aunt Bessie s This was a complete come down from reading the menu to the point were I was compelled to sign up to trip advisor just to share my experience I am a man who loves a good roast and I was looking forward to this so much The wife s was no better in fact she had two and a half roasties  I was shocked to the point that I honestly thought it was a joke and thought the rest of the veg would be coming separately but that didn t happen I set to eating the misery on the plate in front of me and was finished in 5 minutes I wish I had taken a picture because I don t think this review would honestly make you fully appreciate how poor the serving was I was still hungry I was eyeing up other people s food around me thinking what would happen if I d just leant across and just pinched a bit of food  Both me and the wife couldn t wait to get out the waiter asked if he could tempt us with a dessert but in all honestly I don t think I could have coped with any more disappointment I think it would have been my breaking point On the way home I could feel myself getting angry the more I thought about it I wouldn t have minded if the food that was on the plate was exceptional but it wasn t it was just alright On a positive note the horseradish sauce was nice  Being honest the pub itself is nice It s got a great interior and a nice chilled atmosphere Unfortunately this wasn t enough to save the experience With better food this place would be great but as it stands at the moment we won t be returning and certainly won t be recommending it for people who want something to eat  I really do hope the Blundell arms reads this and takes something on board it has the potential to be a great pub 
negative, we went to Alec s restaurant when it first opened the food was nice but not sure was worth the expense waiting staff we very good but they seemed scared stiff of making a mistake did not like the idea of not having wine bottle in sight kept topping glass up so you had no idea of when bottle was running low I have not gone back since and very unlikely to as heard staff are not treated very well 
negative, My last visit was a disaster They ran out of fries  it can happen but for a restaurant which specialises in belgian food  Anyway They offered us an alternative to fries bread Mussels and bread It gets better when after exchanging a couple of emails with their director and manager I realised that bread comes for free with any meal We asked to get croquettes instead of fries but it wasn t an option and the best offer they had was mashed potatoes instead of fries Still not ideal with mussels but it goes with flemish carbonades I just didn t know that I would get 3 carbonades I m not even joking I searched on the internet for pictures of that dish and surprisingly 3 pieces of meat doesn t seem to be the norm If only the food wasn t the only issue waitress telling us that only 3 beers are available from the menu when manager tells me in his email that it actually was 3 beers missing from the menu no one telling us that the kitchen was closing so when asking to order something else it was too late and a manager who replies to my email and forgot to place a sorry somewhere in it but don t forget to tell me that he s got 20 years of experience so his restaurant must be perfect and I must be a liar  From now on it will be Belgo Central It s always packed but there s a good reason why 
negative,as a local to Bakewell I am disgusted how poor the quality of the take out food is generally but just ordered large cod & chips wed evening around 6 30 the chips & not many of them for a so called and charged for portion on a 6in plastic tray with a very soggy greasy bit of batter that contained a pathetic excuse of a portion of fish  you can tell they cater for tourists because if they had to rely on repeat business they would be closed in a week Next time I will drive to Darley Dale as the chip shop there is excellent
negative, Visited on Saturday of the August bank holiday We only really went in as everywhere was busy and the kids were hungry after travelling  23 for two Nutella crepes two coffees and a piece of carrot cake  a tad expensive even for Cambridge but we did know the prices before ordering When the food arrived one set was overcooked and one under The crepes were rock solid and couldn t be cut by me let alone the kids Whereas the carrot cake whilst a big piece was still raw in the middle Very disappointing After wandering around later for an hour or so we came across much better and more reasonably priced places A little local knowledge goes a long way Indeed on the Sunday we got three crepes from the Cambridge crepe van near the market for only slightly more than one from Benet s and much tastier 
negative, I visited with initially high hopes that we would find some decent quality British gastro type food The decor of the place is really cool and sophisticated however its a shame that the food and service do not match Me and my partner ordered steak burgers which were lukewarm accompanied by cold chips The bacon on both burgers was so fatty and poor quality that it was inedible The burger itself tasted okay if you like your beef cold but ultimately I have had far far nicer burgers for less money elsewhere There is much made of the highly vaunted hub-slaw on the menu however I couldn t see why as it didn t really taste of anything to me I have had nicer tasting coleslaw from M & S The chips are also badged as proper chips however they were tasteless and bland  The service also left a lot to be desired The waitress was disinterested and did not ask if our meals were okay or if we wanted anything else including drinks  The table was also dirty and my sleeve kept sticking to it - nice  Overall I might have overlooked some of these things if the prices were cheaper but at 10 each for a burger and chips I was expecting something really tasty and I was left bitterly disappointed 
negative, took my mother there is no provision for disabled people to go to the toilet the food was a complete let down hardly any meat such a shame as I am new to Frodsham and will not be going there ever again the service is friendly enough if you complain they say its a new chef what a laugh who do you think you are kidding this was the same lame excuse last time i went thought it may of improved 
negative, We made a planned visit to this eatery  Boy did we wait for our food Service was poor food was average Will we come again No  
negative, I had corn fritters they were disgusting Very garlicky and I think I found a chick pea in one The avocado was tainted black obviously not fresh I had to wait 35 mins for one of the worst breakfast experiences of my life Others had black dry bacon eggs that were charred underneath and raw on top I was embarrassed to bring my friends here and will certainly not come again 
negative, Ridiculously overpriced food  3 95 for water  14 95 for a crap burger served in a dirty cellar by indifferent waiters  The seven-year-olds enjoyed the animatronic elephants but they weren t paying the bill Buy some nice food and eat it in a park - this place is just a dreadful tourist trap 
negative,Starters very basic main meal steak again bland with one king prawn and a few mussels Glass of wine was very weak n below serving line The restaurant itself had a dirty unclean smell the tables were too close together which meant we were sitting on top of others Thankfully we visited the toilet after our meal and they were disgusting no toilet roll at 1 30pm toilets had not been cleaned and the soap dispenser seemed like it had been filled with water We are now at home and my husband is complaining of stomach cramps  
negative, sunday roast 25 05 2014 terrible burnt Yorkshire hard roast potatoes terrible quishe lost on plate small portion enough for a rabbit lol overpriced beware 
negative, Go every week as kids love it and its there treat Always miss something or have to take something back as cold or in one case half eaten 
negative, WOWWWW how rude is the staff in here  specially the cloakroom lady never ever 15 GBP for entrance is definitely not worth it 
negative, I tottaly regret purchasing a group on voucher for this poor establishment I should of guessed cos its on group on I don t think I ll ever buy anything from group on again I can t believe the poor quality food you serve because I ve got a group on voucher or is that to normal customers too The waiter was kind of confused when our order I asked him twice about rice & naan do we get one of each he said yes Then we was charged a total Rip Off AVOID AVOID THIS RESTAURANT 
negative, Our usual Indian Restaurant in Teddington has recently closed down which has left us a little at a loss when it comes to going out for curry Everybody had been recommending Moidul s to us since we moved here but somehow we had never ended up there Bereft of our old tandoori we decided to give them a try on the assurances of our acquaintances and from the award notices outside  Best Indian Restaurant in South-West London 2012   Unfortunately what we experienced was a rather bitter let down  When we arrived we were seated quickly It was a Sunday and they were fairly busy so we ordered drinks while we perused the menu - the Mango Lassi was off so I instead went for a pineapple juice We opted for their banquet option chose our food and waited to be served After about fifteen minutes the waiter came and took our meal - he wasn t especially friendly bordering on surly but we eagerly anticipated our food as we saw the diners around us being served  After about forty minutes of craning my neck to look for our starter it finally arrived - I had a chicken lollipop which was genuinely delicious with a flavorful tamarind sauce while my wife had samosa We were now full of anticipation of the main course Anticipation started to turn to impatience though as we waited  and we waited  and we waited The food eventually turned up lukewarm except for strangely the rice which was hotter than the sun I had a tasty Lamb Pathia Balti but from the temperature it had spent a good chunk of the time we d waited sat on the side My wife had ordered a Bhuna Balti - when the waiter put them down he told us they were both Pathia Baltis When I mentioned that we had ordered different food he replied that one was the Bhuna Balti and one the Pathia I tasted both and they were identical  Hmm   Once we d finished we were still reasonably happy and eager for a coffee but again we were left waiting for about half an hour My wife had also ordered a glass of water which never arrived so she finally went off to the bar to order one When the waiter bought it she mentioned that the service had been pretty slow and got a curt reply that it was Bank Holiday and they were short staffed - while we were being told this another waiter was at the other end of the restaurant flirting with some students having a birthday party obviously a very time-heavy job The rest of the staff seemed to mostly be concerned with polishing glasses and having protracted meetings with each other We finally managed to find out what dessert was on offer - it was coffee or kulfi Which was pretty much barked at us  The coffee did come quickly and thankfully our plates were cleared having stared at them for longer than I d care to remember but was awful and my spoon had what appeared to be curry paste stuck to the back By the time we d waited another quarter of an hour for the bill We only got that because my wife ordered it from the bar we gave up all hope of having a swift drink in the pub afterwards For some bizarre reason the waiter also had to ask what we d drunk and whether we d had poppadoms For the first time in my life I d been to a tandoori restaurant that didn t offer me poppadoms  We should have told him tap water  Another trip to the bar and she d paid and we escaped this shower Needless to say she didn t tip  To begin with they d just been slow but by the time we left they d descended into surliness and snide grins If Fawlty Towers had been set in an Indian Restaurant it would probably resemble this Suffice it to say we won t be going back and I would recommend avoiding this over-priced over-hyped place when there are far better restaurants in the area 
negative, My Wife and I decided to have a Sunday evening meal in the pub as we hadn t been out for a while and chose this one as we had good experiences in the past We were brought our drinks promptly and our order taken in good time   The this is when it went down hill We eventually received our meal an hour later we mentioned how long it had been to our server who turned out to be the manager and received a we re really busy with no apology In actual fact the pub was not that busy they just had a large party table Our glasses were empty and were not asked if wanted a refill so We tucked into our meals a little disgruntled a few moments later a waitress brought over a plate of onion rings and told us that they had some spare and they would offer this as an apology this was amazing as we had actually ordered a side of onion rings and had not received them anyway So we were paying for this apology I must say my burger was o  k but there s not much to get right or wrong with a burger however my wifes pie has got to be the worst pie in the history of pies The potatoes veg and meat were packed into the pie which we were informed of when placing the order  however there was barely any meat and absolutely no gravy sauce or moisture in there The pie had been cooked dry No one came to check our meals were ok until they collected our plates at which point we voiced our opinion The waitress was very apologetic and spoke to the manager who gave us a discount however the slow service poor food and the fact we paid for the apology onion rings which we had ordered anyway just means we will not be returning 
negative, We ate at this restaurant on the 22 03 14 having read the good reviews on this website Despite being a Saturday night the restaurant was only half full so the staff waiting on the tables were not particularly busy There were 4 members in our party After waiting 20 minutes we had still not been asked what we would like to drink and eventually had to ask the waiter to take our drinks order Alter another 15 minutes we were eventually asked what we would like to order  The food finally came after being in the restaurant for 1 ® hours we only had poppadum s in between The staff were quite happy to take our drinks orders whilst making us wait an extortionate amount of time to bring our main out This meant that we ended up spending much more money on expensively priced drinks whilst we waited for our food  Once we eventually received our bill the waiter was rude and discourteous and we were not asked at any time if we were happy with our meal Whilst I would agree that the food in this restaurant is good our whole restaurant experience was ruined by poor customer service and lack of attentiveness from the restaurant staff 
negative, After being a loyal non complaining customer for a number of months disappointed to say its gone down good and proper over the last few months and today was the last straw Dirty fat supplied our chips with a coating of black bits which my chip loving children refused to eat Gravy is lumpy and pretty discusting and as for batter it s like eating pudding mix  On quietly returning the items of food confronted by very abrupt owner fryer and his less than polite wife who after a heated debate refunded my money and told me not to come back  Maybe they have had a marital tiff but the quality of food now coupled with appalling customer service leaves me no choice but to add to it s already rubbish reviews  And at the prices they charge it s not what you expect     However sealane fisheries 2  the smaller shop at the other end of the resort is lovely  foods lovely and staff very friendly and welcoming only downside is lack of parking but worth the walk 
negative, was told to wait at bar for 20mins which turned in to nearly an hour and then just about to be seated and was informed that they hard run out of chicken and the ribs was another 15mins wait  so we walked out surly they could see we was waiting and new that they were running out and could have asked us if we was expecting chicken and given us an opportunity to go some where else very poor management in my opinion   
negative, DOG awful from start to finish rude staff from the moment we walked in chicken was rubbery like and just awful mango chutney was something i have never experienced before feel sorry for people who regular visit here as there are almost certain to be a lot better elsewhere 
negative, Went in for a sunday lunch The sunday lunch was advertised at 9 unfortunately I ordered one It should have been priced 50p The food was terrible Tasteless gravy like brown tar mac Limp over cooked vegetables Chicken dry salty and depressing Imagine a school dinner then imagine something far worse and you ll have a mental picture of the calibre of the meal At 9 a pop they are almost mocking the customers Avoid at all costs Terrible Staff were friendly enough though 
negative,Having been here three times now please DO NOT GO Deciding to give it the benefit of the doubt foolishly again I decided to treat my wife on bank holiday Monday lunch Firstly the Lady on reception is as welcoming as an East German border guard  On a bad day Was seated and asked for a Campari and Soda The waiter said they did not have this assured him they would at the bar so off he went came back 10 mins later and said the batman had never heard of it so offered me the drinks list and guess what There it was lurking in the drinks list the ultra rare and exclusive Campari Ordered starters of cured ham and melon and beet root and goats cheese salad The Ham was wet and tepid with what looked like chunks of watermelon on the side disgusting The beet root salad was basically a large plate of beat root with about 1oz of goats cheese sprinkled on top both starters were topped with watercress that my rabbit would have refused should have been thrown away At this point decided enough was enough cancelled the mains and quickly departed Take my advise don t go If in Birmingham then go to Adams this is quality fine dining not overpriced pretentious garbage Lastly as a real bonus whilst in the restaurant there are local chavs in the bar with kids running about drinking Lucozade from the bottle No thanks never again
negative, I agree the most expensive Soda and lime anywhere at 2 60 for the same drink at Lion in Edgmond 60p Stiperstones Inn 1 00 other places I have been a charge of up to 1 50 is made and may be considered fair The attitude was poor when queried it and the comment it costs lot to provide is rubbish but if you prefer you can Squash and water for 1 00 
negative,Butter and salid dressing were rancid Lamb chops tasted horrible This was probably why it was the special of the day for 9 99 pounds 
negative, I ordered steak with chips absolute disaster meat was smelly tasted horrible i thought i would be sick it smelled like toilet  Accompanied with soggy nearly white chips salad on a side horrible basically my plate looked and smelled like a piece of crap This place for food is NO NO NO   
negative, Me and my girlfriend ordered a takeaway here and the food was quite frankly rubbish and very expensive at that If you really want a proper curry go to Cleobury Mortimer You just have to see their responses to negative feedback on here to see how they treat their customers Haven t you heard the phrase the customer is always right 
negative, I am unsure why my first review has been removed  there was nothing offensive I am a genuine honest person who had the misfortune of being a customer at this establishment The owner chef is trying to make out that there is a hate campaign going on I can assure you I am nothing to do with any of the other people who have written reviews This is a public free-speaking forum to allow customers to voice their opinions  My opinion based on the one visit that I made in September 2013 is that Misty Waters is dirty too hot and the food is not worthy of the price that it charges Drinks were served incorrect and then spilled the steak that I ordered was not served as requested The table cloths that others have mentioned were stained and had food on them the vinegar bottles had fat inside of them and there were flies everywhere We had a baby with us and were appalled at the state of the place  These are not lies as I was accused of last time that I wrote a review and I am astounded that this man was allowed to write such a response back to me I only wish that I had taken photographs to prove what I have written is the truth 
negative,Just a very average pub Had a real old man pub feel to it unfortunately not in a good way  I think the new management must ve ruined it The first time I went the food was poor - my sandwich being dry enough to look like it was toasted Having given the place the benefit of the doubt it didn t redeem itself second time around The only reason it got one star was because they allow bikes to be stored inside while you have a pint The landlord is reasonable like that
negative, Only the second restaurant in 25 years of eating out that I ve walked out of without being served Went in about 6pm after a family day out Busy with drinkers outside but restaurant was quiet Friendly welcome and seated straight away After that it all went very wrong Waiters were too busy chatting and laughing with each other to come over That is until we got up to leave 
negative, I have eaten twice at Calzone pizza place now and the first time I said I d never come back but my family decided to give it one more try  To be honest it wasn t a very good idea The best part about the evening was the service but as far as the pizza goes  TERRIBLE  I am Italian myself and this gives pizza a bad name Pizza dough is all pre frozen you would get better out of tesco for less than half the price What kills me the most is that there are so many bad reviews about the pizza and they have done absolutely nothing about it Seriously it costs pennies to make fresh dough especially when your charging that amount for each pizza   If they started using fresh dough and marketed it as a new change I think they will do very well from a business predictive but until that day comes I will not eat there or advise friends and family   
negative, Have heard a lot about bentleys over the years and decided to give it a try for a special occasion Well where do I start First impressions wert good Small children running around the dance floor all evening was an eye opener  But thought not to worry as we came for the food My god what allful food First the bread rolls were stale The state was OK although the prawns had obviously come straight of the freezer as they were ice cold and tasteless No staff came to offer a drink I had to call a waitress over as we were about to start our main meal ordered a bottle of red Merlot that to be honest was horrible a 5 bottle of blossom hill or echo falls would have been better No water offered again had to call a waitress over to ask for a jug of water No ice or lemon with it The mains were again obviously pre cooked my wife had the duck she couldn t eat any it was like a month old bit of fat and gristle My rib eye was not much better the veg was tasteless and cold Sweet was ok We never complained only when the waitress took our plates did she ask if it was ok as my wife left all of hers To their credit when we received our bill the cost of one meal was removed from the bill which was a pleasant surprise But in general food was very poor and was not cooked fresh it was some old meet that was pre packed Hence to say would not return 
negative, Staff are ok but slow at clearing tables and asking for drinks Went on recomendation the whole experience very average and looking at the general cleanliness of the establishment I would be worried Personally I don t think it s good value at all unless you like eating dry average food in large quantities Spend your money else where unless you are very easily pleased  
negative, Four of us went for a lunch meal all had different items off the menu and the food in each case was awful Luke warm over cooked and just plain terrible one of the worst meals I have had Should have complained but as with friends who we hadn t seen for ages didn t want to spoil the meeting so kept quiet Go for a drink but eat elsewhere 
negative, What can I say about this FAST FOOD Establishment  calling it an ITALIAN restaurant would be an insult to the more exquisite restaurants that deserve the title  I initially went to this place to have a few drinks with my friends one of which decided that this place would provide good food and atmosphere HA   We were told by the waiter manager that there was no free tables in this what seemed deserted place when we finally got our food order placed on the table  I should have realised then that my starter seemed like it was bought out of ICELAND then to to make matters worse my main course had MEAT in it when I CLEARLY chose a VEGETARIAN dish   My meal was corrected after I raised a complaint to the waiter  manager MANUEL fawlty towers who just shrugged his shoulders not a word of apology and went about his business and then waiting 30mins for our bill that was only because we grew impatient of waiting any longer and requested it again My advise to anyone who reads this GO EAT ELSEWERE  save your money 
negative, Walked in at around 6 and stood at the bar for 10 mins before leaving nobody else at the bar lots of staff on all busy no eye contact with us they just completely ignored us Won t be back 
negative, Awful awful awful this  restaurant  and I use the word loosely has to be the worst I have eaten at in my entire life We visited there on 10th Jan  14 as part of a party of 24 people for a 21st birthday celebration We arrived at 6 30p m and were seated immediately in the rear of the property in front of the kitchen which we had a clear view of The first thing that struck me as odd was the fact that there was little or no movement going on in what one would expect to be a busy kitchen on a Saturday night in north London We were soon to find out the reason for the lack of activity After the initial round of drinks we ordered our meals The starters eventually arrived after a considerable delay At least 3 people at my table including my wife immediately complained about the uncooked food they were served The owner who was standing right beside our table supervising the kitchen had the plates returned to the kitchen to be re-heated Shortly after this I had to leave the place to go and move my car as the parking in that area is atrocious I drove around trying to find a space without success for at least 20 minutes As I was parking I received a call from my wife telling me not to bother parking because we have to leave as the restaurant needed our tables for an 80th birthday party they had booked I couldn t believe my ears as I had not even seen my main course yet never mind eaten it I was hopping mad I returned to the restaurant to find that my wife had already paid our portion of the bill and my main meal was sitting on the side in the kitchen waiting for me to eat elsewhere in the restaurant but as the place was full I don t know where i would have been able to eat it I told the owner to box it up as a takeaway Whilst waiting for it everyone else around me who had eaten their main meals were complaining about the tasteless food they had been given We had ordered a 3 course meal and were only given enough time to have the starter I would strongly advise anyone considering visiting this establishment not to do so my major concern is safety and where we were seated there is no fire exit If a fire started in that kitchen anyone seated back there would have little or no chance of getting out i can t understand how they are in business Not that there would be much chance of a fire starting in that kitchen as all they do is warm things up in a microwave They have the cheek to impose a 12 5 service charge which I would not have paid if I was present when the bill was paid All in all a thoroughly awful experience Don t go there 
negative, Drive on home and collect a meal from your favourite take away  At least then you will not be told at 7 45pm on a Sunday that the kitchen is closing in 15 mins despite them advertising the fact that they serve food until 8 30pm  Steak orders were mixed up so sirloin and rump were cooked ar*e roads about pie sent back to be reheated meat was already tough and dry roast potatoes were indeed deep fried as another reviewer has commented Whole place was cold and a huge jobbie floating in the loo Waste of money and spoilt an otherwise lovely day out 
negative, I recently popped into the Flying Horse for a pint with a mate of mine My draught beer was off however when explaining this to the manageress i was told that it was impossible that there was a problem with the beer Rather than attempt to resolve the problem in any way she just repeated how it was impossible I returned the beer and purchased another beer Very small problem which could of so easily been resolved by an approachable and considerate manager We will not be returning for a pint or a meal in the future 
negative, Do not use the fruit machines   You will lose and the staff watch them and empty them after their shift  Also they close when they feel like it  Avoid   
negative, Please do not eat there I went last week absolutely shocking service cold food and had to wait for a beer necer again 
negative, we are very fond of Indian curry  Last Saturday we had a take away from cinnamon ferndown we didn`t get real test All the food we dropped in bin we have decided we will never order here again Very bad food 
negative, Although I don t frequent this bar on a weekly basis it is generally very good - however the member of staff serving me today think she may have been junior management by the way she was loving playing with the till keys was dreadful I obviously made the mistake of standing in the invisible part of the bar - you all know it the bit in the middle at the front next to the till With a woman to my right no-one to my left this was going to be quick - but I didn t bank on a parade of other women coming to the bar and getting served before me whilst I was left to dehydrate When eventually she decided to serve me my comment that I mustn t be invisible at all was met with a do you want served or shall I serve someone else - the looks she gave flattened my friends pint of peroni Oh how I wish I could transport her to a bar that knows how to treat those that pay the wages - Yates for instance This place needs to put their staff on a customer service course and teach them how to smile 
negative,They describe this place as Authentic Indian Cuisine  well it s not It s just the usual very poor quality thrown together stuff made from the same base sauce For example Rogan Josh is a classic Rajasthani Lamb dish and doesn t have tomotoes in it King Prawn Rogan Josh is as authentic as King Prawn Shepherds Pie A shami kebabi is made from finely minced lamb and dhal brushed with beaten egg here it s simply a seek kebab not a very good one at that in the shape of a burger Dansak is another classic Indian dish made with a combination of dhals it does not have pineapple in it Vindaloo is a garlic vinegary Southern dish which bears no resemerlance to what s served up here Try explaining this to any of the waiters and they haven t a clue what you re talking about Of course I realise that they re not Indians but from Bangladesh so don t describe this poor quality food as Authentic Indian because it s not 
negative, The White Hart has been the family comfort blanket restaraunt for years Used to be good service and food I guess they must have new management judging by our Saturday evening experience Shockingly dirty unattentive slow servuce with mediocre food Felt sorry for the trainee who was the only visible serving member of staff Wont be going back Sad 
negative, We booked this restaurant for a party of 18 on New Years eve Several members of our party had travelled from Canterbury to be with us for the evening Another member of our party was nine months pregnant therefore we opted for an earlier booking of 7 30pm as can often feel poorly when eating later - so this was the prefect timing However the starters did not arrive until 9 45pm and one had been forgotton totally despite only haalf of the party having starters 9 starters approx  Furthermore the table was not cleared and there was no sight of the main courses arriving for a further 45 minutes until we promoted them to bring some cutlery and plates As you can imagine by this point we were all becoming quite annoyed At no point did any of the staff apologise for the wait but eventually brought some of the food out and greeted us with the phrase Do you want the food or not its getting cold he began putting it on the table and we discovered that it was already cold At which point we all decided that New years eve was runied and we promptly left the restaurant - still yet to recieve any apology or explanation from the staff  I would never return to or recommend this restaurant to anyone - a total disgrace   
negative, So 10 people booked for Sunday lunch upstairs at the Marquess of Anglesey to celebrate a birthday - 9 of whom ordered the standard beef or chicken roast the other person going for a home made pie  Do you think maybe the order caused consternation and panic in the kitchen with Chef holding his head in his hands wailing - They want roast On a Sunday How did that get on the menu  We assume something like this must have occurred since it took an hour to serve us actually it was sixty-eight minutes but after the first hour the older members of our party had fallen asleep and the younger ones had lost the will to make old bones  Talking of old bones when the food did finally materialise a couple of optimists hoped it would prove to be well worth the wait WRONG Think school dinners 1950 s style The chicken was Sahara-desert dry the potatoes were just back from collecting their pension and the vegetables resurrected tasteless mush  Service generally was somewhere between tortoise-like and non-existent getting drinks was nearly as challenging as getting food and - having eaten - the wait for the bill was similar to visiting A&E in a busy hospital and hoping to be seen before you die  Of course after about half an hour we should have found someone to tell to stick our order and left Had it been just the two of us we d have done so The problem was being with a larger group where some had travelled from outside London for the special occasion  The only saving grace is that I ll never have to return to this awful place and - thanks to Tripadvisor - I can warn you too 
negative, Having been to the other Kulu Kulu on Brewer street on a number of occasions I came here thinking I would find more of the same Wrong  Very little variety of sushi Only salmon sashimi and pretty flavorless at that The conveyor belt was almost empty it was spinning sadly with little to show The miso soup was probably from an instant bag I don t know but it was nothing to remember  The way to the bathroom in the basement was tricky and when I went down I found myself locked in with the lights turned off Well I eventually got out to an uninspiring dinner Maybe it s better to go for a quick lunck when in Covent Garden but save your Japanese dinner nights for somewhere else 
negative, Visited on sunday 20 05 2012 Had to ask for correct change at the bar given change from 5 instead of 10 not a great start Decided to give their Sunday roast a try Got to say was the worst meal I have ever had and pricey too 50  for 2 starters 2 mains 1 half of cider and 2 house wines My partner had the smoked salmon salad to start was hard pushed to find any salmon my mussel starter was just ok We had two roast beef mains absolute rubbish the cardboard yorkshires will haunt me for a long time Draw your own conclusions from the reviews mainly terrible with one or two excellent  
negative,Saturday 14th June 2014 As soon as I walked into this restaurant I felt as if I was being judged  The starter came extremely quickly and was suprisingly different italian nachos but this was the only thing we enjoyed  The mains were lasagne and bolognese boring I know but both tasted very BLAND For the price of the food and the way they are described on the menu you would expect quite a tasty dish but how wrong I was  The service was also poor from the staff who did not seem bothered other than chatting amongst themselves As there was an England game on most of them basically didn t want to be there and i m guessing the chef who does decent dishes had the night off  We fancied a dessert but in the end decided not to even get one as we were so disappointed to be spending 40 pounds on absolute crap Hopefully this is just a one off as Jamies restaurants seem to have good reviews everywhere but here 
negative, Visited some friends in the village this weekend and popped in on Sunday afternoon for a quick drink We drank up quick and left due mainly to a couple of louts singing football songs and swearing had we have known they have sky sports we would nt have gone in the first place  The atmosphere was terrible There are some truly excellent pubs near by The Black Dog and The Compasses to name a couple so really no need to go near this place at all 
negative, As a chef i know what in talking about been here 3 times now and there will be no 4th chance the waiting staff are happy to amuse but the chef IS the joke  lumpy wet mash potato soup for sauce and dry old meat ain t what i call good cooking quite surprise how highly people rate this  needs a face lift too  
negative, They have okay lobster noodle but are certainly not good at making other Chinese food The dishes we had tasted very salty and the customer service is almost non-existent If you ask the waiters to do something for you which they don t want to do they will just walk away and leave you waiting for a long time Oh by the way if you get along with one of the waitresses she will complain to you about how poorly she is paid 
negative,I ve eaten Thai food in a variety of places around the world but only Hanuman Thai has prompted me to warn other people to avoid this place like the plague  Not only did my girlfriend and I have to wait for over an hour before we got shown to our table  which was booked for 8pm several days in advance but the food was truly appalling My beef jungle curry can only be described as washing pot soup with some stuff thrown in Tasteless beyond the extreme chilli flavouring and utterly rancid  The atmosphere upstairs was quite nice but then my girlfriend and I had to negotiate the drunken thugs populating the bar area downstairs to get to the toilet where I vomited up my my meal  Hideous food Reasonable service Won t be back ever 
negative, Went to this low quality harvester and it s horrible the service was terrible and the salad bar was cross contaminated and looked like it was prepared by monkeys and the chips had been re - heated and looked like a baby had played with them 1st my food was cold and my wife had more hair in hers it looked like the chicken was wearing a wig when complained she was asked if she wanted free desert not even another main crap never again 
negative, we went here for a meal and the service was dreadful our orders came out wrong parts of are meals were missing and my mum s steak was all fat and no meat by the time they did sort out the missing parts of our meals we had already eaten what we had and had to wait 15-20 mins for it to get sorted very unhappy and will not be returning 
negative,Rick this is not good enough and you need to shake it up I ve never written on trip adviser before We eat out a lot Booked weeks ahead and looking forward to it Arrived on time at 8 30 on Saturday and shown to the lounge Ordered in 15 mins and champagne ok Shown to table expecting to find the appetisers but was 25 mins before they arrived we both got very irritated and hungry Got apologies and told starter on its way but it arrived 55 mins after sitting down Place had some empty tables Only two choices of fish bass and sole where was the splendid local seafood Bass swimming in butter potatoes waterlogged fried courgettes were soggy awful More apologies Didn t bother with pudding as by then it was 11pm and the staff were moving nearby chairs and out of the restaurant This seems to be a very expensive training establishment making lots of basic mistakes 
negative, The service was fine hence the one star  the curry mmm if i d just wanted some sauce then i would have ordered a bowl of gravy there was absolutely no flavour to my Chicken Bhunna as bland as it could be  strangely enough my friend who had a chicken tikka with sauce had exactly the same slop as me Buy a jar of Pathak s instead and make your own 
negative, Every year I spend around 9 days in Brighton at a large card playing tournament Last year I discovered this restaurant and went every day sometimes twice Also took many friends and spread the word about it This year I had one excellent meal However the next time I went despite there being plenty of seats they told me that my group of 6 would have to sit in three twos OR would have to wait for an hour and a half in a very much take it or leave it kind of way they could have at least tried to shuffle things around  They don t take reservations  The next day a similiar thing happened not even a pretend sorry we d love to have you but we are full from the front of house So we gave them one more chance at around 4 30 the next day Things looked good since there were only a few customers and plenty of seats but we were told that the kitchen staff needed a break and we would have to wait an hour Not even a sorry The upshot is that we will not ever be going to the best restaurant in Brighton ever again Their sister restaurant is on the seafront so I will try that at some point but if their attitude is the same we will eat elsewhere Have to give you one star since I was turned away 3 times Sorry 
negative, When this restaurant first opened we went along to try it having received the wrong order and then a replacement came out with what looked like a pubic hair on it I got up and went to talk to the Manager He then swore at me after that I promised never to go there again  A few years later however my partner recently got a GroupOn voucher and so I thought I would give it another shot however having tried to book even though there are spaces available I was told there were no spaces for GroupOn voucher bookings This is not in the T&C s and so on trying to explain this to the person he hung up on me  It doesn t matter if they have turned around the food quality this restaurant just does not deserve to survive  There are many other more friendly options in Cambridge please choose any other than this one 
negative, My fianc€÷ and I visited this restaurant expressly to try their Tuesday Night Steak offer of 2 steaks and a bottle of wine for 30 The waiter took our order promptly which probably was the high point of the evening The wine was good and then the food arrived  the steaks both ordered medium rare were grey and very fatty and accompanied by a brown watery sauce masquerading as a red wine jus and wholly without flavour It bordered on the inedible so thank goodness for the accompanying salad The waitress did ask whether it was good and seemed entirely unconcerned and almost bemused by our lukewarm response We then decided we had had enough and asked for the remainder of our wine to be corked and the bill This took such a while we decided to pay at the bar to speed things up Having heard so much about this place we were seriously disappointed and will certainly not be returning 
negative,Waited ages to have my order taken - then nothing arrived Will not visit again Only go here if you have all day to wait and certainly not if you re thirsty on a very hot day 
negative,Fantastic if you enjoy waiting 1 hour for cold food and then another 5 minutes for condiments they should be on the table first so your cold food doesnt get any colder  Asked by the waitress if everything was ok  No its all cold was my response  Sorry was hers before she walked off never to be seen again  50 spent altogether Last time I went here for a roast dinner I had to run to the toilet to spit out the beef as it tasted like it had been left out by the the bins for a full summer Never ever ever again will I go to this den of incompetence  and neither will my 1 000 facebook friends  or their friends for that matter In this day and age with the internet the times where you only tell 10 or so people about bad service you d think the managers owners would take that into consideration Twice Ive been here and both times the same result Disgusting 
negative,Never never again myself and my family decided to treat my mum for mothers day and take to what i thought was a nice Indian restaurant  something different Well clearly the waiters did not want to be there as there attitude was awful and the food was bland and the naan bread was dry as a bone almost like it was days old The toilets were also dissapointing wee on the floor and it stunk  avoid this place 
negative, I tried this as someone said it was nice I should have gone with my gut instinct or at least what I wanted as I didn t enjoy it and I could use the word I never use and say I hated it I had something that looked like water with meat and greens floating so maybe one of their soups     I didn t have more than 6 7 mouthfuls but I wanted to at least show that I had tried it   I was very sick when I got home and for a long time too but it may not be related but I am presuming that my body just didn t agree with it Just my opinion of course 
negative, I m not a curry expert but I ve had a few here and there and even a couple in India Tonight not wanting a over hot dish I decided to go for the Butter Chicken Curry After ordering and waiting one full hour  there was a 21st birthday party going on  our meal arrived Simple to say it was a mile away from an authentic  Butter Chicken Curry My disappointment was obvious and the manager asked in a condescending manor if all was OK No it was not  I have been 3 or 4 times to this restaurant and always enjoyed the food but not tonight It will be my last 
negative, Our daughter booked a table for five plus a baby in a buggy for 2 00pm Saturday lunchtime On arriving at The Weyside Inn we were told by the Waitress even before we had been shown to our table that on ordering our food there would be at least a fifty minute wait This obviously was not a good start after we had taken the trouble to book On being shown to our table there was not enough room to swing a cat let alone park a baby buggy We questioned the Waitress about the delay in being served food and we were told that because it was a nice sunny day they were busy with outside services We chose not to bother ordering food but moved to the bar area for a drink We found a table just outside the service area which appeared to be in complete chaos and we overheard the Waitress in charge completely lose her control over the attendant Waiting Staff and Chef My daughter went to the bar to order drinks and was confronted by surly bar staff who appeared to be stressed out by food orders from the outside eating area that were not being fulfilled by the kitchen My husband and I live in Chichester and are frequent visitors to The Crown and Anchor Young s pub in Dell Quay who are second to none with regards to service and standard of food I would suggest that the staff from The Weyside give them a visit to see how a good pub and restaraunt should be run Obviously we will not be returning to The Weyside 
negative, Having walked 5 miles to the plough changed our shoes and arrived at 1 50 we were turned away after being told they had had a quiet lunch time and the kitchen was closed So we then drove 10 miles to the Cherry Tree and had an excellent meaL 
negative,Staff openly complaining that they are under staffed Not what you want to hear Don t order the lamb steak It s a kin to dog meat Awful experience
negative, After 3 previous disappointing experiences I thought it was worth to give this local restaurant another chance Went on a Friday night after founding an interesting offer on www pizzaloungeandbar co uk PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA ALL PIZZAS ARE HALF PRICE TILL THE END OF THE MONTH EXCLUDING SATURDAY & SUNDAY  As soon as we walked inside the half-full restaurant we were nicely greeted by a waiter who showed us a table When I mentioned the offer he replied that I must have checked their old website our new website - he said - is www pizzalounge-restaurant co uk  Luckily I decided to walk away From my previous experiences I knew that full price their pizzas would have not been good value for money I have now done some research and it turns out that the supposed NEW internet address is not only unattainable unknown to all search engines and registered to someone in Lithuania The only active website for Pizza Lounge is indeed www pizzaloungeandbar co uk very prominent across the homepage - this domain name has been registered in January 2013 by someone  in Rotherhite 
negative, I placed a telephone order on Monday evening around 7 45pm I had to speak to 2 very rude gentleman to explain my address and where I was living so that I could get my order delivered there My order turned up after 4 more phone calls at 9 45 yes 9 45pm 2hours after I ordered it needless to say the food was horrible my lamb shish was like eating rubber and my pitta bread was as soggy as a wet sponge Very poor service with very poor food 
negative,We had a table booked for dinner but popped in for a lunchtime drink Staff very rude and ignored us for 10 minutes Decided that they didn t deserve our custom for dinner 
negative, Wow  This place is heaven on earth  The food the staff and the ambience is pure Italy  Grazie for a fantastico time X francesca and John 
negative, This was our first visit to the much acclaimed Ring o Bells in the village of Christleton I am not sorry to say it will be our last The menu is quite limited and so having decided against a starter we thought a nice steak would suffice How wrong can one be my partner was more fortunate or perhaps just lucky she chose an 8oz rump 17 which was ok however the accompanying garnish half a tomato and one of those daft little cup things they use these days to hold a few chips was not good I decided on the 10oz ribeye at 22 the most expensive item on the menu When it arrived again with half a tomato and the same daft cup of chips which incidentally looked as if they had hit the deep fat fryer more than once plus a side of onion rings  3 50  should nt these be part of a steak platter I digress the ribeye was not edible full of gristle and cartilage so I asked for it to be changed but not wanting to risk another ribeye I requested a rump knowing my companion s had at least been ok when the replacement came I had asked for it medium rare it was pretty much well done and dry but also very tough even the steak knife provided could not make much impression I complained again and was offered sweet and coffee which we declined and asked for the bill The waitress who was helpful sent the Chef s apology and the managers apology but he did not deem it worth a visit to our table He had told the waitress to get our name and address and he would send a voucher still no visit from him Our evening was spoilt my partner having finished her meal before my second disaster arrived I don t think we will be using the voucher even if it does arrive 
negative,My wife and I went to the derby arms on the 5th of July The service was dreadful we saw food sent back on two tables and two groups walk out After 50 minutes waiting for a starter we did the same The staff seemed to be in meltdown on the day of our visit We often dine at the Punchbowl at churchtown and have given 5 stars 
negative,We have had our dose of ripoff for 2012 from steins fish restaurant Falmouth 2 portions of cod and chips don t think we ordered childrens portions this was disgusting I m sure the chips were chill chips not fresh potatoes and the price well don t start me off Tartare sauce was nice 
negative,Often working late in Leeds and sometimes grab a quick bite to eat before I head home I watched this place get taken over done up and was really looking forward to some nice ribs Wrong  Arrived and ordered half ribs sides of coleslaw and chips The slaw was from kfc really shredded and not great in taste Why can you make it fresh thick and crunch  What a shame The chips were ok The ribs themselves were ok but the sauce was so heavy in salt I only managed 3 in total I left most of the slaw and half the chips yet the unattentive staff who were all munching when I arrived didn t ask if my food was ok once Nice one guys  I see why you make customers pay upfront and why the place was empty  I m so disappointed for me and for you I love ribs   I thought it would be a nice eating experience YUK Prefer macdonalds to you place  I won t be back nor will I recommend If you don t sort out the rib sauce service and other aforementioned stuff you won t last long in the city centre 
negative, This place is popular because of the setting but the management realy need to gert their act together You can only book on line monthe in advance when they must have cancellations or free tables You call the restaurant phone number no-one ever answers There is an answer phone facility but they never bother to call you back Given the last few reviews too we wont bother trying again How long before it closes 
negative,There are many many good things about The Crown at Westleton The setting the wine list and the atmosphere are all first class The menu is imaginative and appealing indeed everything was set for a memorable meal and so it proved for one reason - the food was dreadful  A very ordinary beef starter at 9 50 was eaten in three small mouthfuls I pointed this out to the waitress who very politely smiled confirming it was a very small dish The sea bream was bland The saffron potato terrine cooked in fish stock tasted off On collecting the plates the head waiter asked how the meal was Without giving me a chance to answer he said rather confusingly   superb superb  and walked off We declined the pudding and opted for coffee which never appeared  At 80 for two courses and a bottle of wine I feel The Crown is overrated over-priced and complacent 
negative, This review is not about the food or service which were perfectly fine Instead I am writing this review to report a very troubling incident we witnessed at this restaurant My fiance and I were having a nice meal At around 7 30pm a young Middle Eastern-looking couple with a small child came in and were immediately told that the restaurant was full There are several disconcerting facts that lead us to concluded that the couple had been turned away simply because of the colour of their skin 1 Being a Monday night there were approximately eight empty 2 person tables at the time None had reserved signs on them 2 My fiance and I did not have a reservation and were seated in a very nice table next to the window just a few minutes before we are also white  3 Earlier a white family with small children the same age as the Middle Eastern couple s child were seated without a reservation  I would like to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt but unfortunately I really cannot think of a legitimate reason for turning away the couple They were well dressed and seemed like perfectly nice normal people who were just looking for a place to eat  The women who turned them away was middle-aged and was behind the bar next to the door I got the impression that she was the owner and or manager 
negative, Strange encounter - went last week for a coffee and snake at lunch time I went with my better half and our poodle dog I was not expecting to be let in the main restruarant area and happy to sit outside their establishment by the market with our coffe lunch The waiter absolutely refused to serve me as we had a dog He was happy for us to sit on his seats just refused to serve us anything even to take away  His attitube was rude - upset my other half and the poodle Non of us will be going back Their loss as poodle was quite popular with the other customers 
negative, I ve ordered from Hoi Shan a lot in the past but the quality of food has declined to being the same old cash and carry slop you get from any old Chinese takeaway Double doses of orange food colouring and MSGs all round We gave them a miss for a while but we re at friends tonight who still order from them Ordered at 8 20 phoned at 9 40 to see where the order was and we were told the driver wasn t even back from a previous delivery and would be coming to us next which would be at least 20 mins as we live outside newton  No apology or offer of any consolation We phoned back to cancel and they had the cheek to sound put out by us instead of apologising for the inconvenience Order cancelled still no apologies Sure Friday nights are busy but getting another cook another driver and another phone line would be helpful then at least you could compete on service if not food quality We won t be using you again there are SO many other options that get it right why should we give you yet another chance 
negative, A poor disorganised buffet ghastly meat that all tasted the same and churlish service all in a noisy cramped environment for 19 95 And then then they gave me a loyalty card 
negative, Luke warm food cold plates wait ages for the food no customer service from the waitress tiny portions that look nothing like the picture on the menu We had to ask 3 times for the bill we complained to the manageress and she admitted that they had has loads of complaints tonight and gave us 50 off We were at an F&B near Lakeside a couple of weeks ago that was so bluish you had to wait 45 mins for a table but when it came to food and service it was amazing Tonight the restaurant was half empty Pizza Hut next door looked really good will go there next time 
negative, Used to eat regularly at this pub Still like the feel and general atmosphere but hey we went Feb 2014 and will not be going back in a hurry Had to pay 4 00 each for a mild shandy   queried the price and retort was  thats what the till says   Way too much in my opinion Ordered 2 rump steaks Arrived and the accompanying chips were more like left over scalpings than proper chips half a small tomato and one small mushroom Steak arrived concealed by rocket should have been watercress obviously carefully arranged on top of it Soon became obvious steak burnt and charred outside and red inside very tough It was spoilt by poor cooking No-one comes to check if all is ok with your meal now like they used to Old chap who used to oversee the place was a quiet pro and kept the staff and the catering spot on   I guess he may have gone now and BOY does it show Seems full of young inexperience staff and no-one taking the lead Greene King get a grip and take a look at the place   this is the second time it has been poor we gave you the benefit of the doubt   We will not be back again due to prices and poor food   Great pity 
negative, Was charged an extortionate 3 00 for entry when we had rung to ask if they were showing it this was not mentioned  I then Queued for 3 4 an hour at the bar staffed by 4 bar staff for roughly 250 paying punters without getting a drink  I then when I asked for my money back when I left without watching the match was accosted by a the doorman and told to come back at closing time to get a refund  Needless to say it just sums up an ethos of grabbing your money and then not providing any kind of service what so ever Will not ever be returning suggest you give it a wide berth too 
negative, After a five mile walk in the Puddletown Forest we decided to finish with tea and cake at Under the Greenwood Tree  On entering at 3 47pm the shutters were down but the cakes were still on show with a staff member cutting a slice for a customer to take away Realising that drinks probably were not an option when asked I requested two slices of cake to take away The reply was that they could only sell packaged cakes as they were technically closed Gobsmacked 
negative, To say I was very disappointed is an understatement having sampled this particular establishment in person I must say that it does not travel very well at all   I received notification via a well known takeaway App that my food would be with me at 8 which was already a while to wait but anyway  8 came and went and when I checked the App they had pushed the delivery time  Annoying but anyway the Pizza arrived late for even the extended time - No apologies from delivery driver  The pizza was freezing to the point where the cheese had solidified and there was a layer of grease on the Pizza - Lovely  The fresh basil had wilted into the smallest green dots which were almost unrecognizable - I m still not convinced it was basil Apart from that it was lovely  The dough balls can only be described as 4 5 large grapes which were freezing cold and resting on a bed of wilted warm salad leaves  Had they put the basil in the wrong box I would not recommend a delivery from these guys unless you like cold greasy cheese and warm wilted salad bundle this together with the price and you have yourself a very expensive warm cheese salad 
negative, Have enjoyed several meals at Ashiana but this evening had the worst ever Took over half an hour to deliver poppadoms in a half empty restaurant  starter when that eventually arrived was OK but nothing special The mains was inedible - I like spicy food but the chef clearly thought that spice was more important than flavour This was by a long way the worst Indian meal I have ever had and I certainly won t be back and would not recommend Ashiana to anyone 
negative,Three of us ordered food and drinks at the Waterway tonight the local pub near where I live We sat down at a table a waiter took our order and returned after 10 minutes with it While we were enjoying the drinks and food a waitress came to our table and ordered us to move telling us that the table was reserved If the table was reserved why did the other waiter serve us we asked and she repeated rudely we should move because the table was reserved There were no free tables so where should we move to we asked To this the waitress suggested that we stand with our drinks and food When we protested and we were polite the manager ordered us out When we asked what should we do with our unfinished drinks and food he replied he did not give a damn what we did if we did not vacate the table straight away he would get security to throw us out and he got a burly security guy to show that he meant it And when we asked if he was going to refund the money for our unfinished drinks and food he said of course not and shouted that if we did not want to stand hold our food plates and drink glasses in our hands and finish our drinks and food we should get out At this point the security guard started pushing us out A friend of ours an American of Indian origin who works with NASA whom we had invited asked the manager if his rude attitude was related to racial prejudice because all the time the manager was threatening us he was particularly starring down my American Indian friend Feeling extremely humiliated by the managers rude attitude we walked out Though this is the closest pub to where I live I for one will never return If my American Indian friend is not welcome and is treated rudely and we are all treated rudely this is not the pub for me to come to and invite friends and this is not the service and attitude we expect in the Britain of today 
negative, I felt compelled to write a review following the absolutely appalling customer service my girlfriend and I experienced  We had just been to see Aladdin in the theatre directly opposite and coincidently a friend of ours was having his 30th birthday drinks in Bar Soho having pre-booked a table It was our intention to join the group for a few drinks following the show  We arrived just after 10 pm where we spotted one of our friends having a smoke outside and we had a short chat Our friend whose birthday it was also came out and after welcoming us said for us to give our name to the door staff and we would be let in  In front of us a member of the door staff was having a dispute with a male who was of no connection to us I assumed he was a supervisor as he was wearing all black unlike the other staff who also had high-vis I overheard him disallowing the individual entry even though the other member of staff tried to explain to him that it wasn t the individual who they had asked to leave earlier  Anyway our friend led us through and my girlfriend went in first and received a stamp on her arm As I went to follow the door supervisor asked if I had a stamp I said I didn t but I was on the guest list and gave my friend s name Immediately flustered and visibly frustrated which I think came from having dealt with the other male he said I would have to join the back of the queue and pay for entry I gestured towards my girlfriend and he asked if she had a stamp to which she replied that she did because the other member of staff had just given it to her The supervisor said he shouldn t have done this He refused to listen to the fact that my friend had a booking or the pleas of my other friends saying they did not have to pay  Calm and collective I said that it was fine not to worry about it and that we d take our custom elsewhere My girlfriend went to leave and he tried to say that I was being abusive Another friend tried to reason with him by which time I couldn t be bothered to get into a debate He then tried to say that I wasn t being refused entry but I just had to queue and pay It was almost like he realised he may have made a mistake but didn t want to admit it Either way I was more than happy to leave by this point as was my girlfriend  It was extremely disappointing that we missed out on joining our friends but in hindsight I find it humorous that I was told I was abusive It s seems to me that the individual was way out of his depth and couldn t handle the pressure of a busy Saturday evening I would love to witness how he deals with someone who is actually abusive and intoxicated  I m happy we didn t put any of our money into this establishment and we went elsewhere  Avoid at all cost unless you are happy to risk the hit and miss service on entry Judging by other reviews it looks like it will be more than likely a miss 
negative,Went to the restaurant for an evening meal and ordered well done stake it arrived not even medium to well but very medium and under cooked for my liking sadly put me of my whole meal 
negative,Bear in mind a bowl of pasta is approx 20   The food is terrible The courgette flowers stuffed with mozzarella and deep fried tasted only of old oil and cardboard not even texture an actual cardboard taste The calamari starter seemed to have been deep fried in the same oil and was worse than what you might expect from a half decent pub The pasta was not good not much taste to the goats cheese ravioli and the veal ragout was woeful served with a touch of careless disregard for presentation like it had been spooned out of a Tupperware box from the back of the fridge Fellow diners that had the seafood risotto had 2 prawns and a smattering of skinny cockles Looked underwhelming  23  To finish they serve up some deep fried biscuit strips with icing sugar that taste just like the starter   Using the same recycled oil Service was good wine list was good but cheapest red was 32 so you d hope for smth good  For food choose carefully 
negative, Arrived at 4pm looked quiet so knew we would be able to get a table wrong Nobody at the front desk and after seeing half a dozen staff just walk by with no acknowledgement decided to find someone to seat us followed the next staff member who was walking by and asked why no one was on front of house told she was doing something and would be with us in a minute then just walked off   After a few more minutes she arrived back low and behold no tables available so sit and wait we were called to our table after 19 minutes It took us a while to decide what we wanted so our order was taken at 4 25 not served until 5 10   and the food was cold obviously some was ready before the rest and kept on the warmer until all was ready that meant all the veg was cold chips too my salmon was warm but OMG I didnt realise salmon could be that dry and awful None of us were happy with the poor food and poor service certainly wont be going there ever again  Just one more thing you cant reserve a table so you have to take pot luck with availability 
negative, Went on a Groupon deal - they even managed to make that feel vastly overpriced      
negative,This was a very disappointing meal We often frequent Bar San Juan in Chorlton Manchester and El Rincon central Manchester Ambiente does not begin to approach the food service or authenticity offered by the aforementioned We found it s trying to be something over and above normal authentic Spanish tapas and fails Pan Catalan came as two small pieces of bread with a very sparse covering of chopped tomato plus balsamic vinegar Please when has Pan Catalan ever come with balsamic vinegar Not a salt pot or olive oil condiment in sight Albondigas although very nice in a coconut and lemongrass sauce but hardly Spanish and the smallest portion I have ever had anywhere Champignones were again a small portion and came cold This was pointed out but when they returned the portion was much smaller than the original they has obviously not taken it very well All the tapas we ordered came at the same time this doesn t happen anywhere else they are served as they are cooked and appear continually on the table this is part of the experience The jug of Sangria we had was the weakest ever It was more like coloured lemonade barely a trace of red wine and the price of a pint of Cruzcampo was more expensive than central Manchester over 4 This was plonked down unceremoniously on the table without a word it was promptly returned 
negative, So I went in not been in for a while I paid 9 25 for a chicken burger - to take away  The place was reasonably quiet a large group had just left I sat down and waited  And waited  Dozens of burgers were served  I waited  I stood up asked where my food was  It s coming came the response  I waited  More burgers came out of the kitchen  I finally stood up and asked where my burger was At this point nearly half an hour had passed I was told 5 minutes  I told them where to shove it and walked out in disgust They kept the money I kept my dignity  That s the last time I m going in there Or any other GBK for that matter 
negative, I was early to visit a show next door and thought I d have a glass of wine before the show I walked in and the bar was quiet a few tables taken just a couple at the bar before me so I waited my turn As the gent before me was paying the bar man was having a little trouble closing the till draw he was slamming and slamming and slamming the thing everyone in the bar was looking wondering what the commotion was a few were standing up to look over the partitions the noise this guy was making was astounding unfortunately I was near enough to hear the expletives being uttered through the noise of the ever slamming till drawer  I couldn t face it and turned and left there was absolutely no need for the outburst at all either damaging the till or the swearing Doubt I will go back again I ll just head for the bar in the City Varieties next door A shame really as the Swan does have a good wine selection but I doubt I ll rush to trouble it 
negative, Booked a birthday meal - emailed that two of my party were vegetarian Arrived early - having been advised it was ok - and was told the set Sunday lunch menu was the only one available at that time Only one choice for vegetarians which was not acceptable Said we d wait until the a la carte menu became available - only to be told the vegetarian choices listed would not be available - no choice but to leave 
negative, The meal was a treat for a family occasion I had heard great things and so expectation was high All food came on metal serving dishes no plates The dishes were scratched and gave the appearance of being used by many many people before me plates would have been much more appropriate as crockery felt like I was eating out of a dogs bowl I ordered the chicken tikka kebab which was so over spiced it obliterated any other flavour in the dish followed by Lamb Kashmir which at 8 75 contained 4 pieces of lamb which was a yet another sign to me that this place is milking its customers When the bill arrives the largest detail on the slip is Service charge not included I also felt pestered by the service staff who not only interrupted conversation but leaned over me while I was eating and placed their hand next to my drink while slouching over our food to ask if the meal was OK It is hard to get a table which pushes up demand and keeps it relatively busy but this is a misleading indicator as to the quality of the food and the overall dining experience and more a telling sign as to how small and poky the place is Even the cheap lino floor covering was so worn the surface vinyl had disintegrated Will never waste my time and money in this dump again much better heading off to Rusholme for the real deal 
negative, Always enjoyed the food under the previous owners but my first visit under the new owners was a MASSIVE letdown Waited 40 minutes to get a drink another 30 until they took my food order and then another 30 minutes until the food came When it did it was really really bland Then had to wait another 30 minutes to pay And the worst thing It wasn t even busy Poor Won t be making a return visit 
negative, Took client here for lunch luckily he hasn t held it against us Chips obviously fried in old oil barbecue ribs undercooked and warm salad I left food on my plate very unusual for a nineteen stone ex-prop 
negative, A couple sat next to us had been waiting an hour for there light lunch and were told quite abruptly it last being cooked at this point they walked out We continued to wait but then decided after not been served for 15minutes that we would find somewhere else to go The manager approached as we left we a pad to take our food order however as I explained we had not even been offered drinks Very unlikely to return 
negative, Really disappointed  salty sweet and sour pork  even the dog turned his nose up   Had purchased previously from there several months ago when it opened  Not quite the same quality of food anymore   
negative, I visited nyc bar and grill with my friends expecting a reasonably nice meal and an enjoyable experience It is safe to say that I left more than disappointed Although I went on a Friday night it was reasonably quiet and there are no excuses what so ever for how poor the whole experience was We ordered the table for half past 7 and had ordered our meal by 8 o clock The starter came to the table for quarter past 8 which we were ok with For the price which I paid for the nachos they were really not enough and what there was was about edible I wouldn t go any further than that The staff were reasonably quick to take the plates off of the table Yet it was the disastrous wait for the main course which was abysmal We had finished our starters by half past 8 and we didn t see any signs of our mains coming until half past 9 when slowly but surely 8 out of the 10 meals turned up So by quarter to 10 8 of the meals had turned up and the staff recognised that 2 meals hadn t turned up One member of staff had the decency to tell us that they had forgot to make two of the meals When we had finished eating them by half past 10 and they were not worth the wait what so ever I had a Hickory BBQ half rack of ribs which came with coleslaw and fries The ribs were average but the fries were barely edible I left the restaurant wanting a dessert but wasn t willing to wait any longer I would certainly not recommend anyone visiting here for no type of occasion 
negative,Our group visited early on a Sunday evening before a concert in the festival hall The place wasn t busy at all so we were shocked to be told by our server that about a third of the menu was unavailable Given half the menu was missing we ordered some olives that were so salty they were inedible Some others had the salmon carpaccio Turns out its a load of smoked salmon on a plate with a garnish The mains were also disappointing One order of salmon filet was particularly bad To start the order was delivered incorrectly as cod and so was returned to the kitchen only to be replaced with salmon only moments later As a result it turned out to be raw inside The waitress apologised in fairness but by that point not even a glass of the acidic red wine could numb the pain I was surprised to see Gordon Ramsay quoted in the menu but when you realise the only positive endorsement is of the coffee alarm bells should have rung a lot earlier Lesson learnt We all left a little very underwhelmed Sorry I won t be returning 
negative, Visited the excellent cathedral of Ely between Christmas and New Year and decided to try lunch at the Lamb hotel in the heart of the city What a mistake I know that this is the time of year when some service establishments struggle a bit too many customers not enough staff too many late nights  all the usual excuses However this particular visit provided plenty to bleat about One guy behind the bar taking all the food and drink orders So a 10 minute wait there only to find out that half of what we wanted to eat was no longer available well it was nearly 1 30 after all Not to worry though it s the season of goodwill after all Back to the scruffy table to join the rest of the party and then the waiting began After half an hour it was time to see if the simple bar snacks we had ordered were out of the microwave yet Found what I think was the poor lamb who was in charge out front and eventually informed we hadn t specified white or brown for one of the sandwiches This was a surprise as we had ordered wraps and these came as standard pale white Finally we were served the now cool and not very appetising snacks Overall not a great experience and if it was my little lamb I think we d be visiting the abattoir soon I ll award 1 star though for location and it s a good-looking building pity it doesn t live up to appearances 
negative, Christmas lunches at Chartwell Booking essential the NT members newsletter advises Been trying unsuccessfully for three days to book via phone email and Twitter Vmails and emails unanswered  Should have learnt from the poor dining experience at Petworth earlier this year  Not really the way to impress members but do they care Given up 
negative,I had a very awful service at the Novikov recently I have been a customer for about four years now I love this place I often come to the Asian restaurant and the bar and also bring my Clients along ˜ The staff at the restaurant are amazing The Security at the door are normally familiar and friendly  On my last visit on Thursday the 23of October at approximately between 11 30-12 30pm I was stopped by the unfamiliar grumpy Security at the entrance He told me that the Lounge bar is not open for the general public and that there is a private function I told him that I am a regular customer He didn t want to know I had a three clients with me as well I was a bit embarrassed a front of them I told my Clients about Novikov and highly recommend this venue I was about to leave when Security changed his mind He told me that he will let us in if we spent 100 each and if we look after him I obviously understood what he meant by that Anyway it was to much effort to go elsewhere I agreed to his terms I shake his hand with money in it at the entrance And he let us in I was very angry This is never happened to me before I had to maintain calm for the sake of my clients I was fuming I will never go to the Novikov again Its disgrace to charge your regular customers a fees to get in inside to have a few drinks ˜ I have also notice that there is where no private function either The Security not only charge me to get in but he is also lied to me about the private function ˜ This is very appalling behavior I will most definitely not come back and bring my clients The standards in Novikov is drop down dramatically I did also write a complaint through the restaurant website I haven t even had an acknowledgment email back  Please avoid the Novikov       Not worth the money 
negative,Me and my partner decide to go to the Plug & Feathers for a nice meal but it did not plan out that way As we arrived we ordered drinks from the bar and then proceeded to find our selves a seat after sitting down and being ready to order we sat there for a further 20 minutes before a very rude and abrupt ginger waitress with glasses finally decided to come over and take our order after staring at us for the past 5 minutes she then took our order in a manor which i can say i have never been spoke to in my life in a restaurant it seems that this particular waitress has never heard of customer service as when she was taking our order we asked her what burger she would recommend and she replied rudely and very disrespectfully with I m a vegetarian i don t eat burgers  which i then replied Ok but which would you recommend she then replied I just told you I m a vegetarian  i couldn t believe my ears So i just proceeded and ordered any of the ones on choice after spending a further 20 minutes - 30 minutes waiting for our food after we heard the bell ring 4 times and no member of staff bothered to check if anyones orders where ready we proceeded to watch the ginger girl who had served us talk to other customers and staff in the same manor as which she had spoken to us in now I m no expert and i don t work in a restaurant but i am positive that this manor isn t seen as positive and customer friendly after finally getting our meals which were both very dry and luke-warm from sitting under a light for the past 20 minutes or so after we finished our meals we proceeded to go to the bar to pay for our meals when our visit just keeps getting better Once going to the bar we was served by a lady who seemed to be management which also had just about as much customer service as the ginger girl when i was paying for our meals i felt as if i was something that she had found on the bottom of her shoe i can truly say i have never once experienced anything like this and i will not be returning and telling friends and family not to aswell other than the bad customer service skills of members of staff the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and can really achieve but they desperately need to have a strong word with both staff and management 
negative,We had the fish and chips The worst I have had in my life Chips just a soggy oily mess The fish looked good but exploded when prodded with my fork to an empty shell of nothing An elderly foreign couple on a table near us had the same God knows what they thought of our English fish n chips However the barmaid was really nice 
negative, Absolute crap is the only way to describe the food at Bamboo  Avoid at all costs I m afraid  My friend even said it was the worst meal she has ever had 
negative,We had a poor experience of afternoon tea at the Quorn Country Hotel where we were redeeming a Red Letter voucher  on Thursday 6th November In a cold conservatory where rain was dripping through the roof we were served tasteless sandwiches hard scones and then had a job finding a waiter to bring the tea and with stale cakes to top it off  it was not an experience to be repeated Frank and Doreen Armstrong - Leicester Forest East
negative,After having spent a lot of money in store we decided to treat ourselves & have lunch Restaurant  cafe may be more appropriate was probably 2 3rds full but EVERY one of the remaining free tables were uncleared messy & dirty Dont mind paying for lunch but object to clearing cleaning my table before I even sit down Decided to give this place a wide birth & went home to make a sandwich Definitely will not return 
negative, I think it can be difficult for restauranteurs if you show their  chefs at work  Handling food literally comes into its own here cross contamination after copious sweaty brow mops without washing or even wiping hands placing food on the plates with hands My meal looked dull on the plate when it arrived dried by sitting at the hot plate for 5 minutes skinny cold dry chips fishy tasting tomato and a dehydrated mushroom on a plate what a harvest  harvester The main dish a steak was not to my liking very rare it almost crawled off the plate 13 pounds plus for the meal The service was good Gordon Ramsey needs a visit here Poor harvest from the Harvester  I did complain to the waiter who said they would pass it on 
negative, Cant beleive how poor it was Took an hour for the starter arrive  Had spare ribs  1 spare rib was boiling hot next 1 had ice on it and was cold I will never eat here I like my health  
negative, I have just tried to book a table for two days time they say i will need to leave a deposit in order to achieve this quite normal act I have never heard of anything like it i dine out twice per week and have never been asked to do this in the past  i wont be eating there again  
negative, Hugely disappointing After making ourselves comfortable and ordering drink and food we were rudely told to move from our table on the pretext that it had to be made up for other guests No apology offered prior to walk of shame to a dark corner in half empty bar Food and wine overpriced and mediocre Our original table was still unoccupied when we left about an hour later Mystery how a place that can make you feel so unwelcome gets accolades as a top bar 
negative,Ever since this pub has changed hands it has gone down hill I believe that all the recent reviews say it all We used to love eating here but I would not ever eat here ever again We knew that it had teething problems and thought after a while we would give it another chance We went tonight and found that instead of improving it has become even worst We had to wait 45 mins for our order and when it arrived it was cold not even lukewarm   When I cancelled my order I was told that they had for some reason not recorded the table number and had already sent the order out On other hands they had warmed it up once and we re willing to do it again we are talking about chicken   We were not the only people to return our meals and there were a lot of people unhappy   Please think twice before eating here Nice beer but seriously awful food 
negative,took wife mum and dad 29 3 2016 for dinner 5 each gammon dinner chicken casserole scampi let me say these were the worst meals ever to sum it up it was swill gammon was like one thin rasher of bacon evrything was horrible DONT EAT HERE
negative,Wow shocking been going here for years  They ve just done refurbishment We had carvery our little girl had chips sausage  Set meal then they told us the free ice cream had run out for our daughter & we had to pay an extra fee   the place is total rubbish now   never go there again nor will any family members
negative, Really not good tiny portions hairs in the food cirrus were cold Ketchup on the table sticky plastic table clothes Avoid at all costs 
negative, Absolutely appauling On 2 occasion s we have now had extremely overcooked chips pork ball golf Balls would have been a better description and the duck was the fattiest i have ever tasted The first time we experienced this we were not too bothered but to have the same again then it is just ridiculous  14 this cost us and i wouldn t of payed 14p for it Unfortunately we live out of town and making another trip to take it back was not worth it as we were so put off We just wont use them again  
negative, microwaved paellasmicrowaved frozen tortilla frozen croquetas and many more worse comments i will not say I am half spanish half british and have lived in spain and eat spanish food and that is NOT spanish food The hygiene was unacceptable and very horrible But fantastic waiters shame the cooks are apauling Do not go my recomendation and if you are spanish and want a laugh feel free to go 
negative, The food was horofic and tasteless Got stomachache afterwards  Food was not the value of the price and also it wasn t fresh The plate was full of onions just to make it look that it s full  You could smell the chicken and biryani was horribly tasteless without any salt or any other spices  Waste of money had to go somewhere else afterwards to change the taste and to eat properly 
negative, We had been recommended to visit Annie s many times however what a disappointment First impressions were very good for a Friday afternoon and the service was excellent until the burgers arrived  We all commented on how dry the burger was but with various topping s they are disguised clearly a policy of the chefs to hide the fact you may be eating a burger that has been overlooked Whilst eating a member of staff asked if everything was acceptable to which we replied yes The reason being on too many occasions when eating in a restaurant with friends if someone s food is not what they were expecting you return the food and then find yourself eating alone when your meal is returned  It was for this reason alone on this occasion we preferred to accept what had been served  However when the food was cleared we did mention to the server that the burgers were very dry to which she relied they were par cooked before service and then reheated with various topping s On learning this we asked yo speak to the manager who provided us with Annie s cooking practices It would appear they are par or part cooked prior to service and then the various topping s are placed on top and once again grilled to perfection  His words not mine  Reflecting back on his explanation surely experienced chefs are able to freshly prepare and cook a burger after all that is the only product the restaurant sell Perhaps not at Annie s  We were disappointed perhaps during a busy service the burgers are cooked fresh to order but clearly not during our visit  
negative, This place was such a good restaurant and now has been badly damaged Every time we go they refuse to take credit cards only cash this has now put us off and we will never return again 
negative, I ordered the Special meal with Fried Rice It was very bland tasteless and unseasoned I won t be visiting again 
negative, We were in Brigg on a short business trip and thought we d visit China Royal for a nice Chinese What were wasn t expecting was to encounter one of the rudest and unhelpful members of staff I have ever encountered Upon arrival we were quickly sat at a bench seat in reception with a menu shoved in our hands the restaurant was empty and it felt a little strange looking at a menu without being seated at a table To cut a long story short we ended up leaving the restaurant and settling our drink bill without ordering any food due to the waiter having quite possibly the worst interpersonal skills I have ever encountered My advice would be to stay well clear of the China Royal Luckily we found a fantastic restaurant just around the corner so it worked out great in the end 
negative, I run a small business in a different sector than this but I serve the public so it is with regret that I feel I should write this review Small business should try to carve out a niche to differentiate themselves from franchises and big chains Service has to be the key  When our party of four arrived we were greeted politely and directed to a suitable table All other tables had been served except one couple who were placing their lunch order as we were seated Within a minute menus arrived and less than five minutes later our order was taken 4 bowls of soup and a pot of tea Not too difficult then New arrivals came and all were greeted promptly but after 10 minutes or so no food for us Despite numerous requests for the soup it took 45 minutes to arrive No explanation No apology No sense of service  It was easy to see what was going on greet new arrivals and get their orders to hook them in but forget about everything else This is business at its cynical worst I don t blame the serving staff although they showed little understanding of their customers  In this context the quality of the food and value for money are meaningless The meal was ruined before it was placed upon the table 
negative, Had take out from here for the first and last time The chips were cremated dry and inedible the chicken balls were chewy and tiny chow mein passable but even the prawn crackers were stale To add insult to injury it wasn t even cheap lesson learnt stay clear 
negative,I eat out 3-4 times a week 1 or 2 times with our children who we were with this time My wife and I have both worked as bar staff in pubs and restaurants and as a result are generous tippers and always try to look on the positive as far as service goes  This info is relevant when you read the story of the most bizarre pub experience of our lives  We had had a great day out at Howletts with friends who also had children who were asleep  It was about 5 30 so not main restaurant time and as the pub had a kids menu that it would be fine if we brought children in It is 2014 after all  We had placed a sizeable drinks and food order and were chatting happily when the waitress who I am guessing was the landlord s wife came up and said that people at the bar had complained about the noise the children were making and we were to keep it down  My friend made a flippant comment asking why don t they leave rather than us and the waitress stormed off The landlord came charging back extremely aggressively telling us how he was going to stop cooking if we did not do as we were told  We thought it best just to leave because this was not at all pleasant  My wife said they should not have a kids menu if they weren t happy to have kids in the pub  I commented to the landlord on my way out that the way he spoke to his punters was disgusting literally those words and again he charged around the bar again and squared up to me pushed my shoulder and looked menacing I was carrying a 3 year old at the time  He went on to say that the waitress was in tears over that comment and that we were really horrible people  Clearly something else very odd was happening here as we had entered the Twilight Zone  We left and on our way out the locals at the bar were all shouting get out  Another couple of families left at the same time as us having seen what had happened to us  I wish I had read these reviews before going to the place The landlord s wife is obviously left to run the bar and wait during less busy times and she was obviously not having a great day No wait staff should have broken down in tears over that comment  The landlord should be running an inner city football pub and not attempt a gastropub as he is the pub industry s answer to Basil Fawlty he obviously dislikes the punters he has to work with and neither have an idea about how to deal pleasantly with people  This pub is great if you are a local but outsiders beware of the rabid dog and the locals carrying pitch forks 
negative,I ve eaten a lot of Thai food in the past from street vendors in Bangkok to restaurants behind the old Kai Tak airport in Hong Kong a really good Thai restaurant in Guildford Surrey and many others in between I mention this to make the point I know what to expect not to bang my drum  The food we had in TukTuk was horrible We ordered Chicken Pad Thai Green Chicken curry and crispy beef A simple quick eat The chicken in the curry had no texture thinly cut and slimy There was also too much salt in it I couldn t actually say that the meat was chicken  The chicken Pad Thai was just very wet noodles the cheapest chicken that was fibrous and over cooked A cheap nasty combination of ingredients that had no relation to any Pad Thai I have had before  The crispy beef was sweet and crispy Not great but at least edible We had plain boiled rice that was fine  I really cannot say anything good about the food and will never go near or recommend this restaurant A horrible experience 
negative, Went here for a family occasion knowing that when I lived in Gloucester it had a good reputation Only a few of the party had starters so cant comment on them Thought I would be safe with the herb steak so myself and my wife had that Asked if the chips could be substituted with a jacket potato but the sullen waiter just replied dont do jackets so opted for new potatoes Meals came out and wifes meal consisted of 3 tiny potatoes a piece of meat that certainly wasnt a quality cut 1 mushroom and some overcooked peas I had the same but with chips Steak was very fatty and poorly cooked and the flavour was overpowerd by the herbs so could of been eating anything peas were nearly soggy and had no flavour and chips tasted like standard chip shop chips Probably should have complained but as it was a family birthday event I didnt want to spoil the occasion The rest of the party were having puddings so we also had one Sticky Toffee pudding that I had was OK although nothing special but cheescake that wife had was flavourless  With 2 bottles of house wine and 8 soft drinks between us the bill came to 25 per head for a second rate lunchtime meal The sasd thing was I was looking forward to eating here as my first job when I left school was there and back the 1979 it had a cracking reputation 
negative, Went to Auberge at the weekend it seemed fairly busy The restaurant was closed for a private party so we sat in the bar area which wasn t too bad It s not the cheapest restaurant of it s kind but we thought that for 15 per dish and 5 per glass of wine that we would get decent food The wine was nice but when our Beef Bourguignon arrived large parts of it were cold Not luke warm but stone cold like it had just been taken out of the fridge Wasn t at all happy about this and did complain The staff took it back to be warmed up but it had already spoilt the whole meal Although the staff did apologise there was an element of not caring in her tone and demeanour Even when it was brought back hot the food was average and for the price there are plenty of other options that are far better 
negative, Over the Christmas period myself and my daughter have visited this hotel twice for coffee before I start this review I should point out that we are both locals and I have known this hotel all my life right back to its trust house forte days I have always known it for its great food and hospitality so this is hard for me to write but I will not be treated like a second class citizen On our first visit over Christmas we were first met by a very friendly young lady who took our order and showed us to our seats so far so good the problem arises when we come to pay I went to use the toilet whilst my daughter payed on my return I find my daughter is unable to pay by debit card as the hotel has a 10 minimum spend this is not a problem as I will just pay cash but it does appear a problem for the waitress who is holding her hand out in a very aggressive manner and looking down her nose at us Visit two this Christmas we are met by the same waitress who s body language towards us was one of looking at us like we are something under her shoes we place our order and she thrust her hand out and demanded the money in a aggressive manner we drank our coffee and left This hotel will never see my hard earned cash again 
negative, Took some clients for Sunday Dinner What a big mistake  Starters were reasonable but nothing to get excited about  Sunday roast We have to ask for some cutlery as there was none present at the table The quality of food was well below par meat was ok but have had a lot better and vegetables were cold and undercooked No sauces present to compliment the food and when asked for some we were presented with a pot of sachets the kind of thing you would expect to be given in a greasy spoon cafe not in a restaurant We finished our meal and asked if we could have our desserts outside to enjoy the sun and was told we had to pay our bill first before we could have any deserts as they have people leave without paying never have I been so insulted in my life I am a PAYING CUSTOMER Not a thief We were also told that drinks would be added to the bill and we would have to go and collect them ourselves from the bar Toilets were filthy dirty and looked like they hadn t been cleaned in weeks one of our clients female went to the ladies middle toilet to find that no provisions were made for disposal of sanitary wear so had to endure seeing peoples rubbish on the back shelf on the toilet just what you want before you eat  Reported to council as health hazard We would have had better food and service from McDonalds Would never return even if you paid me 
negative, If you like burger and chips for sunday lunch this is for you otherwise avoid where possible we were told that the rotiserie was broken which wiped out the majority of the men including steaks cheap and cheerful doesn t even come close  
negative,we went out for a family meal we ordered the stilton sirloin steak medium nothing to difficult Waited for a while but it was a Friday night so to be expected Food came and the steak had been showed the grill it was RAW So we informed the young gentleman he then proceed to take the steak off the plate and informed my wife to enjoy her chips and peas while he got the steak re cooked 5 mins later it came back out with a blob of stilton on the meat My wife started to eat it but getting down to the thicker end it was still raw So we asked for the manger and she tried to tell us it was because of the shape of the meat What she didn t know is that my wife is a chef at another establishment The excuse s she gave was total rubbish all I can say is I will never eat here again we had to barter to get some kind of discount off the meal  She made us feel that it was our fault when all I wanted was a nice night out with the family which you will not get here Awful place never again 
negative, Complimentary spicy chicken bites were raw blood near the bone and very chewy Scallop starter was very much over done which you wouldn t expect when paying a premium price Main course of fish pie was clearly re-heated in the microwave due to hot and cold spots during eating lamb shank was cold and again obviously re-heated and then sauce added after so no flavour in the lamb We had high expectations of this pub- restaurant but was deeply disappointed on top of that an inflated price tag of 70 for the food we half ate not impressed what so ever 
negative,A nice pub with great views and pleasant staff ruined by a bolshy landlady and one of the most disappointing roast dinners we have ever had  It didn t start well when we went to the bar and witnesses the public telling off of one of the staff by the landlady However the food did smell good so we ordered the road beef dinner Dry over cooked beef with hard roasties and a small amount of veg The only saving grace was the gravy We have eaten far better locally and at 10 35 a pop eaten better for cheaper too On our next visit we decided to skip the food and just have a pint Half way in to our drinks the landlady came over and asked it we d ordered food I replied that we were not eating and thanked her She appeared very put out and I felt like I d farted in church  Basil Fawlty lives on in this one  In fairness as I have said the staff appear great They are friendly and efficient Homemade pies seem to be a speciality of the place and we have yet to have one so they might be good too Just avoid the roast and the attitude 
negative, We had been to the tower of London to see the poppies took a short hop on the tube and arrived at 17 10 Although we had booked the waiter was not interested in this he just said table for two and sat us down even though I said we did book At this time it was not busy so I guess no problem I booked just in case I ordered one spicy and one plain Poppadom My wife ordered a veg samosa I ordered a meat samosa they arrived within 5 mins but no Poppadom I had to ask  Before we were halfway through the starter our main course appeared and the table was too small to fit on 2 x nans 1x dall 1x sag aloo and a special lamb Karaih plus a side of Pilau rice The rice was cold lamb swimming in oil sag aloo very salty and takka dall lentils not cooked out None of it was over hot and felt like it had been re-heated Probably one of the worse indian cuisines we have have encountered We shall not be going again although we will visit brick lane and try another 
negative,We went with friends for lunch The prices are very high and I would be flattering the food and service by calling it mediocre 8 hours later I still feel as though I have a cow inside me and my wife is very uncomfortable The menu has virtually no consideration for the fact that one of the group may not want to eat a fairly grisly lump of meat  yes one of the three short ribs was very chewy that shouldn t happen at their prices The mash and the chips were very ordinary and a salad was drenched in dressing Alter charging 24 for the meat you then have to pay more money for the sauce which is daft because the ribs would be far too dry to eat without Just another excuse to charge more The service would have been adequate in a restaurant charging half the price  no finger bowls and after we chased  twice including walking across the restaurant waving my sauce covered fingers we were brought two bowls to shaw between 4 Really Really ordinary  and that s polite Massively overpriced Pity too because when we walked around Westfield afterwards there seemed to be many other restaurants to choose from Next time we ll know
negative, Was really looking forward to having aGluten Free restaurant in Christchurch However was sorely disappointed We got a table and had to wait for 8 mins to be served We ordered our breakfast which took a further half an hour to come There was no mushrooms so not sure if they put the avocado in place of the mushrooms or it always comes on the side but not what I expect with my breakfast The baked beans were disgusting The fried bread or it might have been toast was inedible The smoothie took 20 mins to arrive and had to remind them I ll admit we did visit a few weeks after they had opened but speaking to colleagues at work it has not got any better 
negative, We had our wedding reception in mill field school in Street we booked 17 roomS AT THIS HOTEL where do I begin Very rude manager smelly rooms and fousty smelling breakfast was awfull uncooked food run out of everything no plates for our food cold coffee then the manager raised our room rates by 10 per room cause not every one had turned up when infant n they had he then took 10 off each room and told us to hurry up and leave our breakfast at 10 am as it was a running restaurant and wanted to have the bar open for lunch time on a Sunday don t waste your money in this horrible hotel 
negative, Gave this restaurant a second chance after previously having a below standard carvery but things still same Dry vegetables because left uncovered the only edible part of the meal was the meat and Yorkshire Raised issue with chef and got a blank expression so got management to deal with issue and ended up with full refund for food and a free sweet which was great 
negative, Car park was filthy as was the restaurant despite it being empty most of the tables were dirty the coffee tasted like cheap jarred coffee despite costing nearly 3 served with a dirty saucer the food was over priced and over cooked and the toilets were disgusting  If you can see that the restaurant and toilets are disgusting Imagine what state the places you can t see are like  Awful  Will never go there again  
negative, Went on Friday evening hoping it had improved after a past disappointing experience as it is next to my wife s office We had to wait at the bar until our table was ready Nearby were the 2 managers of Smollensky s drinking at the bar it was a little after 9pm The cocktails although taking a little while to be made were good and the 2 bartenders very nice So was the the woman who took us to our table From that point it went seriously downhill Our starters took nearly 1h to come and our main courses even longer The food was poor at best to bad The staff although very nice seems to seriously lack of training We felt sorry for the 2 girls working so hard to keep everything together We have not seen the 2 managers once and realised as we were leaving that they were still drinking at the bar  My wife wanted to go to tell them about our disappointing experience but it was nearly midnight by then so we didn t see the point of talking to people drinking for the last past 3h   I can say one thing though managers of Smollensky s stop drinking and start sorting out your restaurant 
negative, We booked Miah s kitchen with a Groupon offer and we were looking forward to spending the evening with friends From the outside the location looked clean and well presented Upon entry we were greeted and seated Everything was going to plan  The waiter approached and took a drinks order and presented us with some menus the approach to the menu was interesting as you could gain a greater insight into the dishes on offer by looking at the food stains on the menu  a novel approach  The food ordering process was efficient and purchased poppadoms and a pickle tray We then waited for our starters to arrive After what seemed like an eternity they did arrive and they were adequate - hardly worth the wait but palatable  We then embarked on the wait for the main course which seemed to take an eternity When the food eventually did arrive the naan bread was burnt the rice was congealed and the mains we ordered were tepid The taste was okay although it was not cooked as hot as I specifically requested Two requests had to be made to remind them of the 3 chapattis my friend ordered His tepid curry was lukewarm at best when he started eating  At the end of the meal we requested the bill The other Miah s Kitchen in Leeds has a limo this venue does not have a printer to produce an itemised and legible receipt When we presented a debit card for payment we were told the card machine was not working - surely something they could have pointed out upon entry After I complained as if by magic the card machine sprung back to life A request was made once again for an itemised receipt as it was not clear how much they had charged for drinks and sundries - this process took 16 minutes and the result A scribbled receipt  Overall a truly woeful experience clearly there is no leadership at the restaurant The drinks and sundries and overpriced and the lack of pricing transparency and intermittent card payment facilities does not inspire confidence Our experience was certainly not unique and all tables in the venue were complaining about the terrible service provided We will certainly not return 
negative, Was very disappointed by the size of the portions and also because the Lamb Balti seemed to be 70 large onion slices and very little lamb 
negative, Booking for 9 people Service was poor with staff who weren t particularly helpful or knowledgeable Food took a long time and was sadly not worth the long wait  Altogether very average for what are above average prices  Nice grassy verge outside for the kids to play around on which was the highlight 
negative, Simply very poor management and staff that said it all for us  As we are local folk i thought it would be nice to come and see the live music and have a glass   thats went it went all wrong my partner requested a white wine   only to be told they had run out of glasses   what a joke of a place  it may be they had a large sitting but you dont just run out  you clear tables quickly   we did get a glass a few minutes later but it did spoil the first few minutes    This place is nice inside and lots of money has been spent   they need as a company with lots of outlets to look at the staff and kick some out  or shut it down and start again   sorry the new mill learn quick or you wont be there in 2 years better still go and visit Bills in Taunton WHO do deliver outstanding service every time  
negative, Being local to the area my wife and I tried out the restaurant on a rather cold evening At around 8pm this spacious restaurant was virtually deserted Just a couple of young ladies who were just finishing their meal I cannot fault the service the staff were friendly and polite  The starters were fine Onion Bhajis and Lamb freshly cooked and tasty It was the main courses that were absolutely disappointing The pilau rice was greasy too much ghee and tasteless all the sauce based dishes were far too stodgy The Chicken Jeera was requested as madras heat  but was bland and what taste it had was unpleasant I resorted to fishing the few pieces of chicken out of the sauce The wife s Chicken Tikka Masalla was a little better but again suffered from the texture of the stodgy sauce The vegetable stuffed paratha and sag aloo both tasted odd we left the majority of these dishes  To be honest a Tesco Indian Ready meal was tastier than this offering and the familiar dishes we tried were among the worst examples in my experience A disappointment and I m afraid will not be in a rush to return to the Swad 
negative, I live directly opposite Alfresco in the flats above the Holiday Inn I haven t visited for some years after my last bad experience there but thought I would give it a try with my partner Whilst we were seated quickly and on the terrace over looking the sea the rest of the experience was terrible  The staff were neither friendly or helpful We asked for tap water which arrived 20 minutes later with the waiter admitting that he forgot  We just wanted a lunch and ordered one course each I just ordered a salad from the starter menu and asked for some chicken to be added The food was reasonable but imagine my shock when we are handed a bill for 33  This is for 1 course each and tap water My salad in fact in total cost 18 95 Utter rip off That and the poor service Avoid avoid avoid Really disappointed  Suggest if you want the view take some lovely wine and cheeses and sit on the beach directly in front You ll have a better experience without paying an arm and a leg for it 
negative, After many visits to the Skyrack for drinks I was impressed albeit maybe through tainted vision   However upon my most recent visit following a long day in the sun I decided along with friends to go for some good old fashioned pub grub After I browsed the menu I settled upon a burger  What was to follow would be a life changing experience I can only only describe what was served between my stale bread bun as the cremated sole of an old shoe  This coupled with the unintentionally triple cooked chips can very politely be described as an abomination  It is safe to say I won t be returning in a hurry to hand over 8 69 of my hard earned cash as I am sure I could rustle up a better burger by lobbing a rancid old flip flop between two pieces of mouldy bread 
negative,They are still going and are just changing names and menu to get more of a tex mex  grill  steakhouse crowd through the door Same owners It s always been a tough place for a restaurant in Fulham and once the new wore off no one understood what low country american food meant Hopefully the newer scaled down concept will work out because us Fulham supporters love the place 
negative, My friends and I ate here for a sit down meal Initially the staff were very polite and our drinks arrived quickly Although the food was very enjoyable one waiter was sitting down on his phone whilst we were waiting for our plates to be cleared Considering there is a 10 service charge added I expected attentive staff To top it off towards the end of our meal we witnessed the older manager shouting at a customer who was trying to pay their bill Overall food was ok but some of the staff were unprofessional and the manager was abhorrent 
negative, Went with my wife with high expectations Very very disappointed ordered fish and chips and my wife ordered fish-cakes When my meal was served the chips were cold and soggy these were changed for hot but soggy chips The fish was more batter than fish The fish cakes were poor and the side salad looked like something off the compost heap Most disappointing meal ever 
negative, The staff were lovely Decoration choice looks as though they ve let an 80 year old blind farmers wife do it Management very unhelpful and far too dim for that level of job  Menu was extremely limited on top of that the first 2 things I asked for were out of stock When the food did come which in their credit was quite fast however I can microwave a packet burger in 5 minutes too it was abysmal The burger was dry and tasteless the salsa was clearly from a packet and unimaginative the chips were underdone and anaemic and I m fairly certain the nachos were Morisons budget brand The only slightly edible thing on the plate was the guacamole The absolute worst was the bun which to put it lightly looked felt and tasted like it had been scraped from under the arm of a homeless man and had all but one of the hairs removed  Great day though 
negative, Poor staff attitude and cold food - too many young kids who don t know the art of customer service As Toy Keane would say   Shocking  Nice surroundings and very good beer - but not good enough to ever eat there again  A place to drink but avoid the food don t expect to be giving staff tips 
negative, The longest serving restaurant in town although it has changed hands a few times seems to rely on its past reputation Service is sluggish at best and the food most likely to be cold Ours was yet again Complaining only has the effect of annoying the manager who shouts at you This time I wont be back 
negative, I haven t visited this pub for about 8-9 years because it wasn t very good Thought we would pop in for a Sunday roast on our way back from a long walk  Now then where shall I start Walked in and eventually we were met by a waitress and we were more than happy to be sat in the bar as long as we were fed  First of all they got the drinks order wrong there were only 3 of us 2 sodas and a lime and soda not hard  I ordered the pork belly and was overjoyed that this was on the menu as I d had it many times before elsewhere and loved it  What came was what can only be described as a dark brown crusted globule of fat no crackling For 11 95 you would expect a decent piece of meat not what looked like a child s brown leather shoe that had been kicked around the car park  I sent it back and asked for roast beef instead It came back and the manager said there you go I ve kept the trimmings on from the pork belly trimmings = 1 large pig in blanket which to my amazement they had the cheek to charge me 79p for  The roast beef wasn t off the joint it was what tasted like pre packed sliced beef and heated up in the microwave The cauliflower cheese I ordered as a side never arrived and was still on the bill They also charged us too much for the drinks that they had messed up in the first place A simple Sunday meal that turned into an extremely disappointing experience We ll take my Mother elsewhere for her day out next time Get a grip Grrrrrrrrrr  
negative,How this Fish and Chip shop won an award is beyond me the staff new or not do not listen to orders clearly  Food Standard is well below acceptable Fish NO taste other than the oil it was fried in  Sausage in Batter as above tasteless and just greasy Chips were acceptable however you would expect far better from a previous award winner and this was shocking so if your thinking of grabbing your Friday night grub pop to Queens Park its superior 
negative, The spotted cow has been closed for some weeks now I live nearby and will review again if it re-opens Meanwhile you will need to find an alternative 
negative, Casa Carlos was one of those restaurants that I d never been told about by friends and only knew by driving past on my way home from the town centre And it s no wonder that no one speaks of the place The food was not as I d hoped You can tell that there was no authenticity behind it and that it was all purely learnt from a reciepe book The manager was a disgrace Most definitely the worst part of the night was watching him drown in drink at the bar It created a shockingly bad experience as it made an uneasy feel throughout the restaurant The staff were lovely and very on hand however seemed uneasy whenever the manager was around as he would speak down to them and shout for the slightlist things when he could of easily participated and gave a helping hand LIKE ANY GOOD AND SUCCESSFUL MANAGER WOULD  I really do not think that he is a suitable manager and his assistant manager was twice as bad Overall I have never experienced anything like it The only good thing I have to say is well done to the staff for making the experience slightly bareable and mainly being able to stick around with him there 
negative, I have worked in the Hotel & Catering Industry for many year and I know that good customer service and hygiene is paramount for the customer  We pre-booked a table for 25 people family on 4th May 2014 as it was a special occasion our father turning 80 years old on that day We were asked to make a pre-booking payment of 150 00 this we paid We all arrived at the White Stone some family members travelling far especially to be there to find that the conservatory room that was reserved for us was in a terrible and poor hygiene state To begin the tables had wax chocolate and debris over it the knife and forks had stain marks some with dried food adhered to them Candle holders were dusty and the bottles of water that they served us had mold growth inside the bottles The waitress later changed the water bottles giving us water jugs that were not properly cleaned and had finger marks over them The waitress apologized for lack of hygiene but then mentioned that the hygiene of the room was up to standard We couldn t dine here as we all felt 
negative,Been out in Cheltenham walking back to the hotel Asked just for a starter and a beer would have got better from Asdas but then they short changed me for 10 quid what a joke
negative, Look s nice inside very retro American Diner the food came quickly   Oh dear VERY Cheap Burger Van quality ingredients uninspiring burger in a bun no garnish no nothing chips burnt on the outside raw in the middle the breakfast was consisted of the cheapest sausages known to man the rest was swimming in a mixture of grease and water   oh and the coffee didn t have that much coffee in it 
negative, We got there and they tried to understand if we was up to spend money receptionist was looking for some really nice tables and when I said just to eat something and maybe 1 beer she gave us the worse table I ve seen in that place Food was nice well cooked and tasty and didn t take too long but as soon as the manager comes to ask how we feel you can see this fake smile on him I started talking on how much better the food was than our previous dining place and he turned his back to me and left Then came after 10 min saying we need to hurry because they need to setup for next customers   We was still eating  After another 5min he came very rude asking the same but super rude I asked the bill They gave me the bill I paid with 50 and they didn t Bring me the change He came to the table and said nothing and was furious looking at us I asked where s my change because obviously I am not going to leave tips to this kind of people and he went to get it and then he was just waiting for us to leave the table I asked if we can sit at the bar for another round of beer and he said first in First served   I gave up on this place literally Absolutely outrageous  Waitress was very nice though 
negative, Our first return for some time after a very disappointing Sunday Roast when the standard that day was highlighted by the roast potatoes which were luke warm  This time we ordered up market  fish finger sandwiches   The greasy poorly drained overcooked two fingers were contained in banded chiabata bread The banding was so burn that the whole had a strong carbon taste  The combination of these factors bound together with a fatty white sauce and limp salad caused me to feel uneasy and reach for my Rennies My wife spend the whole afternoon vomiting and feeling distinctly unwell The ambiance and excellent management deserve better    
negative, Recently probably since 8 jan 2016 the quality of the guest ales on sale has fallen away On sat 22 jan i called in at 6pm to try and have a word with the manager who mostly works evenings I bought a pint of hook norton old hooky bitter but after a few minutes knew that the taste was wrong Isaw the manager to mention this and talk about other concerns His response was i put that on myself today which was factually true as when i came in for a coffee at 0845 it was not on sale He then went to the kitchen and i didnt see him again ileft the rest of my beer and lwent home I have been drinking real ale for 30 years and was in the licensed trade for 15 years and beleive i can tell when something is off or not as it should be i used to spend between 30 and 40 per week here so now much of this is spent elsewhere As regards the coachhouse christmas ale this has been on sale between 14 and 28 jan and not surprisly it has stuck 
negative, We visit this restaurant regularly especially for birthdays and celebrations On this occasion the food was very poor Chewy scallops burnt burgers and basically disappointing food all round Some meals weren t available at all When we complained we were told the waitress would tell the chef No apologies  When you spend the amount of money we spent you would expect the staff to at least be apologetic 
negative,So her I am after walking the dog for a couple of hours and I see their outside sign for Burger and Drink 4 49 and being as I am having a late tea I thought I would avail myself of this On reaching the bar I asked for the above special and I was asked which burger I would like and the lady behind the bar reeled off a list of choices so I took my pick I was the asked if I would like chips or salad I said chips plase I was then asked which drink I would like and I asked for bitter shandy the bitter was off so I asked for lager shandy The bill came to nearly 8 00 when I queried that I only requested the advertised special the lady said that is for a plain burger only Okay I said make it a plain burger then and she asked me for 5 49 and when I queried this she said it was because I was having an alcoholic drink that it would be 1 extra  Non of the above was pointed out when I asked for my original order ie just the deal as advertised I could tell that the lady was becoming frustrated with me and so she remarked that it is in the small print  Now I ask you who has time to study the small print of a sign some ten feet high and designed to attract the attention of passing motorists Anyhow I decided not to proceed and left the pub it was not a matter of cost it was a matter of principle if I had wished I could afford anything from the menu a dozen times over it s just that I object to establishments like this trying to make a mug of me  All a pity really because I have been here on a few occasions in the past and it has been okay but I am guessing that it maybe has a new regime my wife had a bad experience a few months ago so I should have known 
negative, Very poor service Tables were dirty Staff seemed to pay no attention to when people were queuing at the bar to order which also stank of beer worse than any of the pubs I ve worked in in the past  None of the main courses we wanted were available  no fish and chips  - best avoided 
negative, My wife and I made the mistake of stepping in here for a drink a few weeks ago The beer selection is very limited and the wine is worse The pool table kept us there longer than we would otherwise have tolerated - there was no atmosphere the place was almost deserted while we were there What a dive 
negative, I took the family here to enjoy a new years day dinner and when stepped inside I thought I was going in a Premier inn restaurant the decor was awful When shown to our table and given a piece of paper that was the menu it was very limited of choice ok if all you wanted was with chips frozen ones at that  No rice or pasta dishes  The family settled for the burgers and I fish and chips another disappointment the batter thick to make up the size of the fish and greasy and frozen chips not to mention the peas well over priced I had better ones in paper at half the price can I go on  The puddings came from blakes or another manufacturing company for the price you were charging it could have been home made  We are local people and I am a chef retired  Did you know frozen chips have a coating of wheat on them to give them colour something to be aware of with customers requiring gluten free  Will we be coming Back again No way a great disappointment 
negative, I visited Wetherspoons Yate  Thorns Farm  located in the shopping centre on a Sunday morning with friends We ordered vegetarian breakfast but they had run out of sausages Our second choice was Salmon but they had also run out In the end we went for toast and marmalade but guess what They had run out of marmalade  My friend noticed that when the waitress was bringing our cutlery the waitress was scratching her neck with the end of my spoon  We did not leave a tip we will not return 
negative, How can this be called a Japanese Canteen serving long grain boiled rice without any seasonings and no Japanese ingredients maybe Savoy cabbage but that s about it Really bad  certainly won t be coming back 
negative, For my Mum s birthday a group of the family went to Severnshed for an evening meal  The atmosphere in Severnshed is excellent - great location great scenery very nice interior and bar area The music was excellent too  The food was just as excellent as the atmosphere Thumbs up all round kudos to the chefs Excellent quality food and tasted beautiful  However the service we received tonight was horrendous  We were seated on time at 8pm It was not until 9pm when we were asked what we would like to order We were waiting for an entire hour to order our food  The main meal was not served until 10pm - a 2-hour wait  However for 2 of the family they were waiting for an extra 15 minutes After complaining a manager  said that the 2 meals would not be charged for However there was no apology to the group of us from the manager or the waitress  We finished our mains around 10 30pm when we were given the dessert menu The waitress left us with our dessert menus and decided to go off and clear tables - when many restaurant goers were leaving She did not return until 11pm For the entire half hour she was clearing tables when there was no demand for tables at the time  At 11pm we said we would not be ordering a dessert due to the delay We were all also worried about how long it would take for the desserts to arrive if any were ordered  Even when asked the bill did not arrive for a further 20-30 minutes  There was no apology whatsoever from our waitress or from any manager She did not thank us for dining at Severnshed nor did she say goodbye  The service we received from the waitress was very abrupt Not even a friendly smile and she seemed to be rushing everything It was busy and they were clearly short staffed but all that was needed was an apology I feel sorry for the poor chefs - the food was of excellent quality and from scenes in the kitchen everything looked very hectic  When we were first seated the waitress gave us our menus and also threw specials menus down on the table When some of the group decided to order from the specials menu we were told that this food was only served until 7pm and on Monday to Fridays We visited on a Saturday We should not have been given these menus and these menus did not state the times and days of when you could order so after being given these specials menus we expected we could order from them but we were not allowed  The atmosphere the food and the music may have been excellent but when dining out you expect to receive excellent service too There was no hello no thank you no goodbye and no apology  We have honestly received better service from Domino s Pizza before When a pizza arrived very late once they were very apologetic friendly and offered vouchers Not a problem at all Why couldn t this happen with Severnshed  There is no reason for us to ever return to Severnshed It was for a birthday meal and we were all left disappointed by this shocking service  It was an absolute shambles but thank you to the hard working and clearly stressed out chefs who provided an excellent meal once it did turn up  To anyone from Severnshed who may be reading this - you seriously need to employ more staff and have a friendlier and more apologetic attitude towards your customers You lost out on sales because a very large group of us didn t want to order dessert due to the service we received with our main course For the first ever time when visiting a restaurant we did not give a tip Your service was not worthy of one What does that say about our feelings An apology as well as a smile goes a very long way y know  Another note to add - you clearly breached health & safety laws by placing 2 chairs in front of the doors to a fire exit Not safe at all in a busy environment should anything have happened Management here need serious change 
negative,went on wen for my girlfriends birthday she ordered prawn cocktail to start prawns were frozen and when she got her main a steak it came to table cold service poor even do it was quiet poor management never again and the cheek to but a service tip on the bill john
negative, I never do these review things but after my birthday last year in a hot desert surrounded by taliban i didnt think food or service could get worse  i was wrong  Went for a meal out with friends on recommendations from a year or so back  Went in on a wednesday night Ordered drinks and asked for a table for 4 stood waiting for about 10 minutes in this time a war broke out between 2 young children probably the owners children with plastic guns rolling on the floor and shouting at each other right next to the restaurant section  After being seated we were given the menu s which had a nice selection and ordered our food with more drinks  The drinks took half an hour to come out and some were even missed the food took even longer  The meal was edible but something that could easy be slapped together with ingredients from Aldi and a working knowledge of a household cooker  The Sirloin steak my friend and I ordered was very fatty the chips were oven chips and the salad was like the bagged leaves you can get at most supermarkets  Our other halves both had fish dishes Scampi and Salmon neither were impressed with the quality of their meals  We will not be returning very poor service poor food and high prices considering quality 
negative, Good food let down by poor service and no communication with kitchen and front of house would I go again no 
negative, Our party booked in advance and pre ordered for the youngest members birthday Arrived at 20 00 as per our booking After 55 minutes one of the party asked the chef why we had not received starters He got extremely aggressive and seemed to want a fight I have been on this planet for 52 years and have never witnessed such atrocious customer relations Of course such aggressive behaviour caused our party member to react in the same manner which did not help The chef s partner proceeded to make excuses about how busy they were etc   Alarmingly she then said that we only have a small kitchen If this is the case why take a booking for 15 people if you cannot cope The starter then turned up over the course of ten minutes but it was another hour before we received the main courses once again over a period of ten minutes What happened to the days when a party ate together Call me old fashioned but if those served first displayed good manners and waited for others their food would have been stone cold All of the party on leaving this restaurant agreed that the food was reasonable but were disappointed not to receive any apology for the TOTAL LACK of service a drink on then house may have placated some In fact after a few comments were made to the chef owner his ARROGANCE returned and he wanted to fight and or call the police One of the younger members of staff said on leaving you need an NVQ in customer service  What more can I add I have had some good times in this restaurant but will not go back again until some form of service is restored such as a new owner I am now advised that we are all banned Absolutely incredible when we are those that have been wronged 
negative,i would not eat at this resturant again me and my husband went there yesterday the one in kingston park newcastle we had muscles for starter x we both became very ill x so i phoned them up and spoke to the manager called carl which i told him what had happened and he called me a lier i am now going to take this further as it not excptable when someone comes down with food poisioning from bad food hygeine
negative, I went with my Family We made reservation for 6 adults 2 children When we arrived they made it for 4 adults and 2 child They didn t have any more places So we have to squeeze ourselves Ppl are not friendly and the Price is way overpriced I informed them that i will have to rate them and it seems they don t care They charged 12 5  services which i refused to pay  My advise if you have to come here make sure you receive the confirmation by email or sms 
negative,Despite it s funky appearance and friendly staff this place is an old school Boozer  Ordered two coffees totally undrinkable and I m not being pretentious they were genuinely really sour As was the atmosphere with every one in there totally legless by 5pm on a Sunday afternoon I was looking for a nice local pub but sadly this one isn t for me 
negative,I have popped in here a number of times when in the area I remember it just for its appallingly slow service I am in there now with my son we ordered a couple of cups of tea and a sandwich and are still waiting 20 minutes later I am sure it s not just us because last time we were here a woman who had been waiting a long time just exploded at them and walked out For the Love of God raise your game 
negative, Terrible service will never visit again The staff were rude We felt like we were an inconvenience 
negative,Just got home after a meal out at the smoke steak house First choice starter shrimps was sold out at 7 30 pm Garlic Mushroom starter was just breaded frozen mushrooms with no taste and a dollop of mayonnaise Main course Ribs and chicken came straight after starters had been cleared and were both cold I sent them back and were returned with soggy fries and warm coleslaw and dried tasteless chicken and ribs  Will not be eating there again  
negative, Food is really bad Steaks are like leather Give you a cup of chips  which consists of between 8 - 10 chips  totally inadequate propotions get same for 2 for 10 as for buying just 1 meal Swore last time i went  6 months ago would never go back Sorry is all you get back when complaining didn t press any further because of company with  IN A NUT SHELL IF YOU LIKE INEDIBLE FOOD WITH SMALL PROPORTIONS AND BAD SERVICE THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU  STAY WELL CLEAR 
negative, A friend ordered three snacks Two correct orders arrived but instead of sending garlic bread they sent out some wedges We couldn t be bothered to complain so just ate the wedges instead 10 mins later the manager starts demanding 5 for the wedges we ate but still no garlic bread arrived We refused to pay and then the manager barred all of us until he isn t manager any more   As suggested in the title we believe it may have been the blokes time of the month which lead to the poorest display of management I ve ever had to endure All he had to do was send out the garlic bread and we d have had a whip round for the wedges but instead he had a nightmare and looked like he was going to burst into tears  Shame considering how good the rest of the staff are all of the time Let s just hope he doesn t drag them down  Oh and if you were wondering the wedges were fantastic 
negative, A so called student bar It is a joke The food is terrible over priced It is a place for mums with pushchairs too sit around with a coffee anf chat not who it should be aimed at seeing as it is a student bar 
negative, we have ordered take always several times in the past and food has been very good this occasion 15 4 16 was awful curry s watery bread seamed only partly cooked sag alloo potatoes hard and undercooked also lamb rogan had 4 small pieces of lamb in total  I understand that the tadka is run by the ex vari people vari was always excellent shame tadka has got so bad 
negative, Last night I had the bad fortune to pick the Golden Phoenix for dinner The interior looked very nice and the door staff was very friendly Unfortunately it went downhill from there Me and my gf were seated on the first floor in a corner table the menu was already on the table It took about 10 to 15 minutes till a waitress showed up to take our order without any kind of greeting Are you really to order  When I wanted rice with the sliced duck in orange sauce she said that would not be possible Also noodles with my gf ‹s sweet and sour chicken was impossible I still have no idea why but in the end we settled for rice instead of the noodles which was possible After another long discussion the waitress conceded that a separate bowl of rice would be possible with the duck When I discussed the options with my gf the waitress turned away made a face  The drinks arrived very quickly The Tiger beer was luke warm her water was cooler The food arrived minutes later and wasn ‹t hot but barely warm enough The duck consisted of 8 slices of duck in a very thick sauce Both dishes tastes rather bad Having had the duck in a different restaurant in Chinatown before I know it can be much better  When the waitress arrived next she never even asked if we liked the food just brought the bill and obviously was annoyed for not getting tipped When I told her what was wrong she smiled and walked away without a word  Without exaggeration I can say that this was over all the worst dining experience I ever had 
negative, Poor service Would not let a injured servicewoman sit at the bar on a stool due to health and safety reasons A member of staff who was off duty removed the stool from said service woman and made a point of it to the whole pub which wasn t full We understand this is a rule if the pub was full but this wasn t the case 
negative, Went here on the back of an appealing advert in the local press A big mistake There were only 4 people in the restaurant during the complete time we were there We were to find out why  The starters were ok and this did not prepare us for the disaster to follow My wife asked for the venison and for it to be nicely rare and pink - it is always rare and pink stated the waitress When it came it was very well done but not in the nicest way We ll do you another said the waitress The second attempt was not much better The dish also came with sticky red cabbage - not a small amount but a massive heap quite off-putting  Meanwhile I had the lamb cooked in 2 ways The rack of lamb seemed ok on the outside but very quickly was discovered to be absolutely raw on the inside It had to go back and the chef apologised and offered another one Instead I had a steak  They did offer a free dessert but by then our appetites were gone  Altogether a nasty experience 
negative, We was there with a couple of friends on Saturday night Our food took ages to arrive It was only just tepid and my side order of onion rings was cold inside My friend had a train to catch and could not eat it all because of the time it had taken to arrive No apology from the staff who do not seem to care Overpriced Overrated and Never again 
negative, This was our first visit to the Rajkot and there was a sign encouraging us to write a review on Trip Advisor so here it is We arrived at 6 00 on Saturday evening for our younger son s birthday There were only two other tables occupied Poppadoms and initial drinks arrived fairly promptly and the order was taken After 15 minutes 3 of the 4 starters arrived It then took over 5 minutes for the fourth to arrive and we chased it up twice during that time Thirty minutes after we finished our starters our main courses arrived We started eating but discovered that two of them were cold not lukewarm but cold so we sent those two back Two of us ordered a jalfrezi which are usually very tasty but these two were very bland No taste just salty We ordered another round of drinks to take the salty taste away but these took over ten minutes to arrive even though they still weren t busy at this time We finished up and left as soon as we could Our first visit to this restaurant and also our last 
negative, Initially it looked like a welcoming traditional ale pub Great selection of beers but not good for groups Don t move tables as the staff member on duty doesn t like it Very rude and abrupt Avoid 
negative, Myself and my fianc€÷ received an appalling service when we visited the Real Eating Restaurant in Lewes on Sunday 18th September We arrived at 1 30pm and due to the restaurant being busy we made a reservation for 2 15pm Upon our return we were informed that they had run out of roasts which in itself is very poor for this time on a Sunday but were told the rest of the menu was available Although we were disappointed as this is what we specifically booked for we decided to stay and ordered the duck from the menu After a further 40 minutes of waiting the duty manager came over to inform us that there was in fact no duck left and all the food had run out citing that the chefs had left and were understaffed Although she was very apologetic this service was entirely unacceptable It reflects very badly on the restaurant that we had to wait so long to actually get a table only to be told that they could not cook our requested meal a considerable amount of time later Added to this my fianc€÷ is pregnant and was extremely hungry only to be let down  We live in Tunbridge Wells this was our first visit to Lewes which was unfortunately ruined by the terrible service we received  If you are considering coming here dont Go to Bills restaurant just down the road far better service and nice food 
negative,Called in for lunch had ham sandwich come with 2 pieces off cheap bread and a square piece of ham charged ten pounds for that plus 2 teas and a cheese toastie again two small slices of bread with no cheese hardly disgusting blatent rip off charging quality prices for the cheapest rubbish they can buy 
negative, Where to begin The chips that came with the burger were undercooked The newspaper style paper stuck to the burger bun making the buns difficult to eat The buns were also quite soggy The waiting staff were quite poor in service and I will not be visiting again 
negative,My fianc€÷ and I visited Revolution while shopping in York The location is fantastic right on the river and the bar looks great However we sat outside and asked for two pints of coke an extremely simple order and we were planning to order something light to eat when we received our drinks Literally 15 minutes later we were still sitting in a half-empty beer garden waiting for 2 drinks another couple left before us and told the waitress they had been waiting 15 minutes for a glass of wine and a pint of lager  After 10 minutes I asked where our drinks were and was told they will be here soon  I waited another 5 minutes then got up and left 
negative, Was looking forward to going to Grand Central and we were warmly welcomed into what was a really interesting restaurant which spanned several levels  5 of us ordered and the food came quickly but we were all a bit disappointed Talking about mine I had a 8oz steak one third of which was inedible veins and which cost 18 95 What I did have was to be fair tasty  The deserts were a different mater 4 people had 2 scoop ice cream and what came was the most tiny tiny portion that looked like a melon baller had been used For 5 it was outrageous I had a banana split and I specifically asked for no sprinkles Pit came with sprinkles and all I got was a banana with squirty ice cream A joke for nearly 7  None of us will be returning 
negative, FOOD 5 10 over priced Bland meat really chewy  SERVICE 1 10 waiter couldnt understand us and had to keep getting the manager never said goodbye or thank you when leaving the restaurant even though we were the only ones in there  DRINK 2 10  thought i would go for a bottle of rioja because of the restaurant name and it was the worst red wine ive ever tasted the only reason it scores a 2 is because my daughters tap water tasted quite nice  ATMOSPHERE 1 10 shabby conservatory and about 3 tables dining wont ever return  PRICE 0 10 really over priced for average food la tasca is much nicer and thats saying something  OVERALL 1 10 The fact that they had only 2 out of the 8 deserts available says it all my wife asked for some cheese and biscuits they brought out a bread basket with bread and cheese ritz biscuits and a plate of about 10 slices of chedder and when the bill came they had charged us 9 95 absolute shambles of a place 
negative, Ordered a 55 take away The chicken dishes contained no chicken Telephoned to complain and were told the dishes are not freshly prepared & made in advance so they found it hard to believe  well believe it there was no chicken Unhappy with the poor customer service we then complained to manager Max who s customer service was even poorer If you want reheated vegetables & poor service then this is the place for you 
negative, I placed an order for a simple 18 inch pizza that comes with four toppings source was forgotten pizza was cold and actually managed to get two of the topping wrong including spicy peppers AVOID THIS CRUD  
neutral, Like many people we had heard about the views at the top of 20 Fenchurch Street and thought while it London it was worth checking out  Let me tell you the views were fab Fantastic panoramic views of London Take a camera You can do all this from the Sky Garden  Bar  The Darwin Brasserie itself had an OK menu not a huge choice Myself and my partner were served by a chap with an incredibly strong Italian accent He was very hard to understand and seemed to struggle understanding our order He asked us if we wanted bread and olives which we decided would be nice as appetisers before our main courses arrived We asked if the bread came with olive oil and balsamic vinegar which he seemed to say was no problem We waited for approx 15mins before the break and olives arrived minus any dips Within a minute the mains arrived which we sent back as the appetisers and main courses should not be arriving together 15mins was a ridiculous wait for bread and olives We asked the waiter where the balsamic dip was to which he marched off only to bring us a bottle of malt vinegar Clearly there was a huge communication issue  Eventually our mains arrived which were OK Considering the price you expected alot better  Incidentally we didn t see the waiter again while we were dining We found out we were his last order before his shift ended I strongly suggests he works on his English if he wants to work in restaurant in England  Be careful with the olives and bread as they were not priced on the menu We were charged around 3 50 for each A service charge of 12 5 was also automatically added to our final bill which they say is to be paid at your discretion  A good experience for the views but if you want a decent meal perhaps look elsewhere London has much better to offer 
neutral, We found the setting good but the service did not match the location The food was OK but no more Not on our must go again list 
neutral, A good thing about here is the fact that on your birthday you get a free meal and cake Presentation of food is always rubbish Ribs very nice though but stupidly expensive It was once the dogs doodahs here but now just a so so place that is drifting away 
neutral, Had fish and chips here yesterday and was disappointed At a cost of 7 50 you get exactly the same fish and chips you get for 5 quid anywhere else As if that weren t enough they charge you extra for ketchup and mayonnaise all this for the regular takeaway menu Nothing special Not recommended  
neutral, Lovely lady on reception Food is ok a couple of our dishes tasted similar Will try again maybe to eat in next time around On the plus side the food came out quickly 
neutral, We had takeaway fish and chips from Bizzie Lizzies whilst on holiday in Skipton Although they were tasty I was surprised to read some of the glowing reviews by other visitors Perhaps we were there on an off night but there was really nothing special about my meal - just run of the mill fish and chips Big portions though 
neutral, My first visit to this establishment for over 20 years brought two sayings to mind   you get what you pay for  and  does what it says on the tin   I visited on a Saturday evening with my wife and two boys aged 3 and 1 There wasn t a table so we waited at the child friendly bar The place had evidently been busy throughout the day as the tables hadn t been cleared of glasses The boys absolutely loved it from start to finish The food was good the service friendly 
neutral, I heard lots about Eric s and I finally got round to giving it a try It was **OK** but no more Maybe I missed something I would certainly give it another go  I found the menu a bit conservative and uninspiring Pretty simple menu really    chicken fish steak    don t get me wrong I happen to love chargrilled tuna steak yes it works perfectly with a nice salad but somehow I was expecting a bit more wow from the menu and in the end I found it rather difficult to get excited about choosing anything After going round in circles for a long time eventually I took the vegetarian option which must be a first  The food was tasty enough Again nothing amazing but ** OK ** Some of it a bit unbalanced eg some very nicely cooked scallops obliterated by a rather dayglo relish Portions by the way are very hearty It s bistro style rather than fine dining and feels more like a lunch place than dinner Bread comes one of those flat pieces of slate -  Now the main issue I have with this restaurant Be prepared to endure the most fearful racket during your din-dins Actually I quite like bustling exuberant restaurants But upstairs especially the noise was quite spectacular Unlike other reviewers there were no big parties of 20 or anything just normal clientele It was not helped by us having the probably the worst table in the house a kind of afterthought table-for-2 placed right by the kitchen entrance I feel it would be better to remove this table and trade a little bit of yield for an improved ambiance We really couldn t hear each other By the way the kitchen is quite unbelievably busy and impressive and we did express some awe at the young waiting staff buzzing in and out at 100mph like ants This is a fantastically productive kitchen for sure  On booking I would definitely recommend you ask for a downstairs table  Staff not bad very likeable very young Our young girl could not un-cork the wine She then enlisted her friend who also struggled Neither could pull the cork out because try as they might they were simultaneously pinning the cork down with the retainer of the corkscrew A bit embarrassing but in the end they sort of mashed it out somehow Not great treatment for your 35 bottle of wine  In summary  noisy cramped bustling lightning quick service in at 7 30 out by 8 30  100 lighter for 2  It s great to see a place doing well but I think Eric might consider reducing the volume of covers and just slow the tempo a little 
neutral,Finally decided to try this restaurant after hearing and reading a lot of positive feedback This was a Tuesday evening so after checking the menus on the website thought the Midweek Menu three courses for 17 50 looked really good and we each could find something we liked on there However upon being seated we weren t offered that menu at all The main menu did have some lovely authentic Italian dishes on there so we weren t that fussed but think that if the restaurant advertised a table d hote menu then they should offer it  Seated at the table we found the oil and balsamic vinegar dip a bit disappointing There wasn t nearly enough olive oil and the vinegar was cheap thin and acidic Freshly baked ciabatta would have been expected in a restaurant with this reputation but the bread seemed nothing more than a regular sliced white farmhouse loaf We both ordered the king prawn starter which was really nice Succulent fresh prawns butterflied in their shells with the garlic butter not overpowering the fresh flavour of the shellfish  For main courses one of us opted for the waiter-recommended salmon with roasted vegetables soy and ginger and and one had the veal saltimbocca The salmon was nicely cooked and very tasty but the roasted vegetables consisted mostly of tomatoes The veal was most disappointing being a classic Italian dish and was expected to be well executed in this establishment The veal was not as melt-in-the-mouth as would normally be expected but the worst aspect was the lack of sweet nutty marsala wine flavour to balance the oiliness of the butter sauce and the saltiness of the Parma ham Unusually for me I couldn t finish the veal because of the heaviness of the butter sauce and after paying these prices didn t feel inclined to invest more on a dessert  The restaurant is very well presented inside and out and the service was acceptable although at no point did anyone ask if everything was to our liking In summary a restaurant that on this occasion did not live up to the standards it seems to be presenting and for 65 including only two drinks was felt to be overpriced considering the quality of the food 
neutral,I have been to Red Ginger a few times but only now decided to review We decided to visit on Boxing Day while the restaurant was quiet but a lot seems to have changed Since the my first few visits the menu has changed and no longer includes the Sushi dishes that made this one of the better restaurants in Barnsley  The service was good however the food was not all that great Starters were actually pretty good however the mains were a disaster My partners Black Bean dish was very very salty to the point where water was needed to actually wash it down and when it came to my schezwan dish I think the chef decided that he would use chili as the only ingredient as there was little taste to what should be a great dish Doubt we will go back as it seems to have changed for the worse Barnsley has some great restaurants but finding a good Chinese is now a struggle 
neutral, Great coffee as usual but very slow service At an airport where most people are in a hurry you would think that Costa would have addition staff to help when line ups get too long Pity Coffee - A+ Service - F 
neutral, Five of us called  including two small children Charged 7 to use wacky warehouse which I thought excessive  especially as we were all eatng and drinking there so would not be in the play area very long The food came  I had a beakfast  Bacon was small  mushrooms watery and tasteless but the sausage was lovely  My wife had a chicken salad Asked for no dressing but it arrived with two ramikin dishes of dressing one of which had spilled out a little  The chicken was fine but salad at this place means lettuce with one slice of tomato Nothing else  no cucumber or onion or anything The childen s meals were OK pizza and chips and fish fingers and chips  
neutral, Situated in St Aldates we saw this as we got off the tour bus it was a hot day and there were seats available outside They make their own ice cream here- having returned from the med recently - they were not totally innovative or unusual in taste They were supposedly made from Jersey cream but I would not have known The wait in the queue was long and laborious and they did seem to be a little flustered as someone else mentioned There was a lack or organisation about the whole service We got served by very pleasant member of staff she made all the right things but failed to open the coke top gave us very cool latte which had to go back to be reheated the bagel we ordered was nice - pastrami - but she said she would bring it to us outside and we waited and waited - when my husband went back in to complain his coffee was not hot enough he heard them calling for someone to collect the bagel Nice enough but ice cream was 3 40 and the bill for two soft drinks Small bottles 250ml  a coffee a bagel and a small smoothie was 20 so not cheap  Would go again but they need a good manager in there 
neutral, I have now stopped using this place as I find the service very average and the cost of eating quite high The food is good but then again it s only pizza we are talking about I like the menu offers some nice varities and spins on a common theme  Unfortunately I have often found myself waiting for service and that is often at the point of just getting there First impressions do last and unfortunately for this place I won t be going back I would urge you to try for yourself as hopefully things may have improved 
neutral, May wait some time to get served a popular eating place with the locals but not that friendly and not a lot of atmosphere some of the tables are a bit squashed in places but food not to bad worth a try i think 
neutral, pretty poor fair Not the best service and food not especially good for the price Better places within easy walking distance 
neutral, Been a few times the food is always high class and delicious however this time for lunch the atmosphere was dull definitely better in the evenings The spanish wines are sublime  
neutral, Disappointing visit today I use here when I visit my hairdresser its an hour from where I live the garlic mayo was left out of my roasted vegetable wrap which I did mention to the assistant when I purchased 2 peanut butter cup cakes to take home when we had them later there was no peanut butter flavour to the cream a token choc something as d€÷cor but the cakes themselves were not nice I think they were old one young lady who was mainly taking the money was pleasant but the other quite uninviting I also bought 2 x rocky road and again these were not fresh 
neutral, This is a cafe restaurant but we bought their pizzas to take away The bases looked like frozen or pre-prepared and were definitely not freshly made proper pizza bases Pleasant enough but nothing special and we would have been very disappointed if we had paid to eat in 
neutral, Went here with a party of about 40 after a funeral There seemed to be a couple of other lunchtime do s on just after us The food we had was ok - nothing wrong with it - but nothing made it stand out Open sandwiches  small slices of crusty bread with minimalist toppings  cheese and tomato pizza cremated pardon the pun  to within an inch of its life so it was unrecognisable chicken portions a herd of pork pies at least half of which got left  various square loaf sandwiches some chips which had a slight old oil flavour and some cakes Overall people ate a reasonable amount but whilst it was ok the food had the character of the hotel - a bit of stuck in a time warp of days when people thought it was a bit posh Seems a strange place for a hotel restaurant anyway - I mean Liversedge of all places - it kinda suits the Marks and Sparks Plus Fours brigade I guess expensive and safe Give it a try - you might like it Staff were friendly and helpful which is always a bonus 
neutral, I went to the plate and porter about 2 months ago for my mums 50th anniversary i had never been before and the first thing i thought was that it look very posh and romantic but then again i thought it looked a bit old fashioned so therefore i think there was some moderning to do with the resaurant We went to the back room because there was a lot of us but i thought we were seated very well and the food was lovely I cant fault it one bit the only problem for me was the look and that it looked a bit old fashioned for my liking 
neutral, I have just returned from my visit of AJ s Bistro in Blackpool Whilst most of the reviews on here are exemplary I must slightly disagree I had booked through Groupon on a deal for 2 courses for 2 people at 19 I was told once I had tried to order that there was no muscles starter and the Lamb and Duck wasn t available from the mains So really the only main meals on offer was chicken fish and steak  The waitress never really made us feel welcome - I had the feeling she didn t want us there Maybe because we were on a Groupon deal We wasn t told on first entering about the menu options available on our deal and was only told that the food was not available upon ordering Once we had finished the meal the waitress took the plates away but did not offer us the dessert menu or a coffee After a while I had to ask for the bill There were tables that had not been cleaned away and only 3 groups dining  In conclusionn I would say that the food is excellent however if I was paying full price over 70 for a couple for the meal I would of been disappointed However if you can get a deal then its worth a visit 
neutral, Having regularly visited for Sunday lunch for some time somethings gone wrong The once melt in your mouth roast beef lunch you could now re sole your shoes with To the point we no longer visit this pub 
neutral, Had been told this was a good place to eat so gave it a try Large menu choice not always a good thing quite a lot of fried food and microwave meals steaks expensive and plates filled with lots of chips to make up for small portions of main item One of our meals was not cooked enough and had to be left rather disappointed on the whole much better pub food available in this area 
neutral, Coffee was great although could have been hotter Had a sausage muffin at around 10am and it was very poor Sausage was small shrivelled and hard at the ends where it had been kept hot or reheated Can take to dog in which is why we always go there - but was disappointed today for the first time  
neutral, It s fine the staff were good knowledgable and helpful The wine was good as was the food If you are looking for a good pub meal this is a good choice with a nice location alongside the canal 
neutral, Very nice quick service The Meze is excellent Try the House Turkish white wine Very enjoyable food 
neutral,Having read several differing views we decided to try it for ourselves  We hadn t booked a table and staff were reluctant to let us eat despite there only being 4 other people in the pub and no reserved signs on tables I m not sure whether the Bar person had recently had Botox but she was certainly expressionless and smiling seemed beyond her After a 45 minute wait our food finally arrived and was ok not piping hot but not exactly cold either It seemed to take an age for our plates to be cleared once we had finished our meals we were not asked if we would like desserts or Coffee s so we decided to leave it at that and went on our way 
neutral, I eat out a lot but am rarely moved to review unless I m particularly inspired or irked This place is a good pub I ve been to many times The food I ate for lunch there today was great no complaints The service was deeply troubling One clueless young barman was blameless various hung-over managers gunning themselves soda were mostly absent but a waitress talking loudly and rudely about customers while cashing off and transferring tables was something else I ve never felt so unwanted as a customer service doesn t end when the bill is put down or even paid It ends when you say goodbye to customers I could have left there weeping and no one would have noticed 
neutral, Let s be upfront - I m disappointed I ve eaten in this restaurant several times over the last 9 months and mostly had enjoyable Greek food good service and bustling atmosphere Tonight I departed from Lamb and Greek Pasta to date very delicious  i chose calves liver cooked in olive oil and lemon and was even asked how I d like it cooked Medium rare my preference It came soaked in some red wine reduction sauce and I sent it back as it wasn t what was displayed on the menu or what I d ordered They took away the sauteed potatoes and green beans to keep them warm After longer than expected I got an overly thick piece of calves liver which was barely cooked - blue in steak terms It was clear the chef had no idea how to cook calves liver and I again sent it back and declined to order anything else prefering to finish my sauteed potatoes and beans So everyone makes mistakes - it is how you make ammends  try to repair those mistakes that really matters I got apologies I explained that I usually get good food and the waitress shouldn t be apologetic or embarrassed - the chef should be they acknowledged they know me and were sorry for serving such a poor meal So far so good I asked for the bill They brought it with the starter side vegetables and two glasses of wine included I d have happily paid for my starter - but feel the glasses of wine and vegetables should have been written off to really show they were sorry  My conclusion - this is a business - and I m just another punter - this is a tourist restaurant I was offered a free drink after I d paid the bill but declined So the morale in my story - good food if you stick to the lamb Leave the calves liver well alone - the chef doesn t know how to cook it  I won t be going back because I think they didn t offer me the right compensation for a very poor meal experience In short I felt treated like an anonymous customer tourist who they wouldn t see again  And actually in that they are right 
neutral, This is really a little gem the curries are really good quality and full of flavour My Chicken Balti had more chicken than i have ever known in any restaurant before The egg fried rice is different but all the same very nice The high light of the trip was the cheese and garlic naan the best i have ever tasted fresh tasty and very large  
neutral, My wife and I visited Quince during the first week or so after opening the place has a great deal of promise but really needs to get up to speed to match the local competition The place has been very nicely decorated and fitted out the service was polite and friendly but we got the feeling from the apologetic waiting staff that they could only serve food when it was ready to serve The food was at best OK the ingredients seemed to be of good quality the main problem seemed to be in the balance of the preparation i e  one main course dish hot the other just warm after standing waiting for the second plate The prices for both food and wine looked to be competitive but with two other really good places to eat only yards away in the High Street it really needs to get up to speed to be serious competition We will give it another try in a month or so when the teething trouble will hopefully have been sorted out 
neutral,I think it s a no brainer that when visiting a chinese restaurant the chances of getting a decent western style customer service is at 10  I have been to many chinese restaurants around the world and it has been very rare that I ever got treated how customers normally get treated at a lets say European restaurant As controversial as this may sound this may be to a culture thing and just how they work Chinese staff are normally very rude in the sense of they throw food at your table they don t give you the time of the day they don t wait till you ask for the bill and you d be lucky to get a genuine smile from anyone The only time they seem happy is when you are going and have paid  This place is one of the cleaner ones in China Town but if you go to the restaurants opposite I don t believe you get silly 10 charges for a table and the food is as big in portions and cheaper The only different thing here is you can get a nice variety of bubble tea and the way the place is set up makes it look clean but i d question that  I have been here a few times now mainly because I don t want to take people who are with me to a lesser looking place that d put them off but if i had a choice and was on my own I wouldn t be too bothered because the food in most of the restaurants in china town pretty much taste the same and you re guaranteed to get the same rude service anywhere there 
neutral,I ve been here several times in fact my office is so close I could probably have them deliver my lunch for me and I have to say it s very hit or miss Sometimes you ll go in there and half the menu wont be available - but they wont tell you this when they give you the menu rather wait until you try to order Their timings are also a little amiss sometimes lunch is incredibly quick and other times like the last time I was there you will wait 40mins for your lunch Sure you get an apology but that doesn t make up for the indegestion you suffer for eating it quickly to make sure you re not late back to work I d recommend the thai green curry and that s probably about it Fish finger sandwich always seems like a good idea at the time and always disappoints  Of an evening you get some right divs in here Usually pi$$heads that have been drinking since 5pm trying to pull the ladies with their dancing  It s ok until about 7pm then i d advise you to move on 
neutral, We had a good pre theatre meal Service quick and attentive Menu selection good Flavours were fine good but not great except for the soft shell crab which was superb restaurant small with a crowded feel A restaurant for a good quality value for money meal  
neutral, We were a party of four with a small child and were pleased on arrival to see a table ready and a child s high chair in place Even though a Sunday lunch time there was only one other table of two people and although very nice decoration   Shame no Japanese front of house staff when restaurant says it is authentic  Welcome very low key and main server very unsure of himself and when we asked something different to the menu we felt we were in a Little Britain sketch as we were told could not do it as the computer was pre-programmed  Were not asked how meal was and felt not only cold in way served but there was no heating and one meal arrived with tissue in it  We had to ask for everything and the only other member of staff was walking around with a look that would not have been out of place on the Titanic when it hit the Ice berg The food was very good although if you want a filling desert do not choose the Ginger cheese cake  A 10 service charge is added automatically which I always feel is unfair and we even had it added to the retail purchase we made which is not really fair  So in summary  Great food but poor service  and will probably only return if need of a Japanese food fix 
neutral, Not the best food I have had As the name suggests Food Factory that s exactly what it feels like a works canteen then I suppose that s the whole idea Wont be going back there 
neutral, difficult to east Burger out of a bowl  service good  Deal of Burger & pint good good atmosphere Pub owned by different chain NOT as good as before 
neutral,Look it was a nice location and the food was fine but when you pay over 80 for a 2 course meal for 2 no wine you expect to be very satisfied The service was lovely and the fish well prepared but there was no wow factor and I probably wouldn t go back 
neutral, I ate here as part of a large group 14  The restaurant is quite stylish and upmarket The waiter was very keen that rather than receiving 14 different orders we selected a banquet consisting of a mixed starter followed by a variety of three different curries to share amongst us for 18 per head We were brought poppadoms to start which were accompanied by some unusual pickles Unfortunately there was only about a tablespoon of each pickle per tray and they went very quickly meaning I ate most of my poppadom plain The starters were very nice and well presented on a rectangular plate However the main courses were a disappointment Once again the portions were very small and the curries were good but not great I didn t think I got very good value for my 18 
neutral, Popped into Holt for a wander on my way back from work and thought I would treat myself to coffee and cake at Byfords as I do love their SPONGE cakes After being ignored by all of the staff who were milling about some who did look at me but I must have been invisible as they didnt say anything or approach me and I couldnt catch an eye long enough to say anything I decided to get a take out rather than sit in One of the staff behind the counter was serving a man in front of me but the others were chatting so I waited and waited a bit more and then eventually managed to order my coffee which was rung through the till without me getting a chance to ask for my cake When I said I d like something else I was made to feel like it was a big inconvenience Both cakes were put into one bag without asking so mine got mushed with the one I was taking home for hubby and at the end I got my change shoved at me So overall a bad experience but still good cake hence the Average rather than Poor 
neutral, We wanted to eat down the road but they finished serving at 2pm so we thought we would try the Magna Charta It s many years since our last visit and it has changed hands and had a full refit which has been done very tastefully with screens creating little rooms all very nice We were greeted beautifully and offered a choice of tables our order was taken and the drinks arrived The food was well presented my scampi was nice but my wife s salmon was tasteless The table was cleared and we expected to be offered coffee but none was offered and neither was the bill I think we had hit a staff changeover no one was to be seen so I paid the bill at the bar and we left OK but could do better would be my comment 
neutral, From the food point of view I find this restaurant very typical of most Indian Restaurants I have visited Most are pretty bland and nothing special to write about If entertainment is your choice it does provide some music dancing and if its your thing some Karaoke  My big issue with this place is it crams far too many tables in the space available if you are seated in the wrong position it can be quite an obstacle course to get up and away from your table My recommendation is to find another restaurant 
neutral, Short and sweet review  Since the new manageress has been present everything has improved - I thing she s taken it and shaken it service food and particularly the beer are greatly improved  I personally think that the layout and restaurant seating could be improved seating by the main entrance door is not brilliant particularly in the winter and the route to the toilets is through the restaurant passed numerous tables - I would not sit at these tables bit more thought needed here  All in all greatly improved from a month ago 
neutral,Visited earlier this month For a set price you can keep ordering food was ok Hardly any meat on the ribs and king prawns in batter were greasy and the prawn tasteless but the chicken skewers were nice to start Paid extra to have the duck as a main item it wasn t great- again hardly any meat At time if paying my card wouldn t go through despite knowing I had money in my account tried a second card twice with no luck my partner also tried his card all accounts had money in so clearly a problem with the machine connection The waiter became very snappy and said that it was obviously our cards and not his machine we had cash on us so paid and left  His attitude left a sour taste overall the meal filled a hole but wouldn t go back 
neutral, We went for the Meal Deal menu which offered a small choice of pub type food at a reasonable price  The quality was excellent and it was served promptly after our order was taken - 30 minutes after we arrived at the premises  There was a choice of 3 real ales and the one I chose was as good as it gets The wines were competitively priced  All good so far BUT  The waiting staff were all busy but seemed to lack co-ordination and training Avoiding eye contact with customers lest they be given another job was the one thing they were good at  There was a notice near the entrance advertising for more staff It looked as if it had been there for some time  One set of toilets was out of order  With a Premier Inn next door this place has a captive market and it ought to do better 
neutral, Small friendly pub which is good to watch the football on with the two TV s it has showing sky sports The barman who used to work there Russell was a really nice guy who recognises you which is very important in a pub 
neutral, Visited this inn for the first time with my wife and brother and sister-in-law for an early evening meal as the inn had been recommended to us by another member of our family The service by the young waitress was very good and three of the four meals were fine however the pork kebab meal ordered by my wife the pork was very tough and inedible the waitress told us that the chef felt she was unlucky and that he would do another one The meals took about 25 minutes to come out not a problem originally however as the rest of us had our food on the table my wife would have been eating hers after we had finished ours so she declined and just ate the rest of the food on the plate We thought that my wife might have been offered a sweet another drink or reduced the price of her meal but no such offers were forthcoming which really disappointed us  The Compton Inn is a typical old small village pub with a nice atmosphere and innovative menu however In view of our experience the four of us will not be visiting this establishment again 
neutral, The venue drinks and staff are great The food is average Unfortunately on a weekend it s the clientele this place attracts that lets it down Feels like you re at some kind TOWIE audition 
neutral, Went here a couple of times for a drink while in Newquay Was okay nothing special Good location We got charged for a soda water with our round which was weird as never been charged for a soda water in any other pub we ve been too 
neutral,This used to be a lovely place so good I was quite taken with having membership here The food was delicious the selection good and the service fab  What happened room  The menu is nothing like it used to be It s been changed and changed so much it s not an echo of its past life I also have issues with this hideous butter they were serving balsamic awfulness on a plate I only asked for some extra bread to go with the pate because there wasn t enough to which I was charged for Now I don t mind paying if I m being a greedy guts but the minuscule pieces that came with the started weren t enough to use half the pate if you layered it on 6 inch thick  It s still a nice place to drink however Nice selection of cocktails averagely priced Poor selection of bar snacks now though They used to do these delicious mini burgers - oh they were beautiful that is until they decided they weren t worth the hassle because they kept getting dropped on the floor  Call me old fashioned but if they were falling off the daft slate thing put them on a proper plate   
neutral, We ve visited several times over many years almost 20 location is great for walks dog friendly area outside views and access to beach However and I know they wanted to refurbish and extend but the building and decor is getting very tired almost rundown and when we visited it shows Even though service was quiet we were served deep fried sausage not as good a quality as they use to be and the mushrooms were served in a small pool of butter and oil not very appetising but tasty still the same  We will be back but hope to see better quality and better presentation not a lot to ask for 7 50 a head I hope the owners management update the premises 
neutral, We visited 24 10 13 and both enjoyed the mains Steaks are as expected pretty good The sides were equal to them I enjoyed the wine pot 500ml and thought that a great idea I do have a negative though The deserts I would just do mains on another visit I had the signature chocolate sponge with soft chocolate filling that tasted of very little and my wife had the almond tart which was like a shop bought version Not awful but very much an after thought to the mains which were good The coffee was ok The service was quick and good Friendly Ambience was nice too unless you hope for a quiet meal Its a buzzy place which I liked Its town centre after all Next time I will stick at the mains 
neutral, This was a regular haunt for me I d taken lots of different friends here and all were impressed with how great the food was The space was small but the atmosphere was always nice and the food was fantastic Nobody was ever disappointed  Unfortunately since the management changed the menu has been noticeably simplified the prices increased and worst of all the food quality decreased to merely average I guess they ll make more money doing this but now the place is no longer special so I won t be taking people there any more A real shame 
neutral, Ate on Easter Sunday with wife daughter and grandchilden age 20mths & 3 1 2  Service was very pleasant and efficient Restaurant was fairly busy about 60 full of familys of all ages  I had Mushroom risotto not the best although pleasant but could have been hotter Portion was small for the price Wife had fish and chips with pea puree Reasonable portion size but a bit pricey Daughter had burger & chips Good size and flavour Gradchildren had pasta and fries child meal  Lasrgeamount of penne pasta with very little sauce on it that looked somewhat dried in parts small pot of fries which were ok for their ages but would not have done a 6 or 7 year old and expensive for what it was 
neutral, So this is the re-branded Beefeater steak house The decor is certainly modern open light and welcoming with plenty of other diners The meal was a bit of a hotch potch King prawn cocktail was just plain difficult to eat The prawns were indeed kingsize and covered in a rcih cocktail sause However they still had shells and tails on which considering they were covered in sauce made them very difficult to eat They were presented in a bowl with huge chunks of tomato and cucumber so the only way to eat any of it was with a knife and fork on the wooden block they were delivered on which just made a mess with sauce and shell pretty much everywhere The rump steak main course was good The steak was cooked as asked for medium rare and the chips were good quality Again the presentation let it down - a large white plate a cup of chips the steak and a lot of garden peas frozen presumably  The pease looked like a real after thought  Colleagues were equally disapponted A small portion of moules A tatseless starter of cheese and chipotle dippers - they actually looked like mince pies Overall a very disappointing experience with the steak being the only redeeming feature 
neutral,This has slipped since apparently changing hands It used to be very good - I hope it gets back to standard 
neutral, we went to this restaurant for the first time as we had heard good vibes about it we found the staff very friendly and a good choice of food although it was only average when it came the venue is quite small and everything seems to on top of you not a place we would go back to on a regular basis 
neutral, Wetherspoons have their fans and their critics - but the good news is that you know broadly what you ll get  A large room with a TV somewhere showing sub-titled news channel A long bar with a wide range of drinks including craft beers and decent real ales A fairly standard menu with a different focus each day with a particularly good value meal deal Cheap prices - buying in bulk means that the costs are kept down The London Hatter gets a cross section of the Luton populace with some students from the University just across the road but not as dominated by students as you might have thought  If you hate Wetherspoons don t go there 
neutral, Admittedly the food was good but hugely overpriced It s not possible to have a traditional tapas consisting of many dishes here without taking out a second mortgage The selection of Jamon for two consisted of eight small bite sized slices of admittedly good quality hams for 13 pounds bread had to be ordered separately at a cost of 2 pounds for three slices  This goes against what is the essence of a tapas restaurant quick tasty plentiful affordable dishes 
neutral,Given that we booked to go this restaurant based on the high ratings it had on tripadvisor I must say it was a very underwhelming experience The food was OK but both my partner and I can cook better than this The decor was alright though the glass tables don t work if you scratch your chest chin it can look to people on other tables that you re touching yourself up  And the music didn t seem in keeping with the overall effect that the owners are trying to create  Ultimately though a restaurant should be rated on it s food and this is where I feel L Assiette has a long way to go to be worth 5 stars It s not bad and some elements of the meal were good but nothing was exceptional 
neutral,My wife and me brought my sister for dinner I had been looking forward to the 32oz flaming challenge but they had run out of that as well as the 16oz This was by 7 30 I settled with the 8oz We waited 30 mins for our food even though we were not advised of a waiting time When the food came it had a tiny bowl of pepper sauce The only saving grace was the steak was cooked perfectly Not sure I will be returning 
neutral, Breakfast experience was poorly managed Dirty plates cold food on occasion Evening meals were better presented 
neutral, After a moorland walk this cafe provides a welcome refuge We have called several times when the coffee and tea has been fresh and the bacon sandwiches of good quality The chap who runs the place does so with a cheerful smile and there is no standing on ceremony Boots for example are not frowned on That said a lick of paint on the outside and inside would give the place a more professional air Scuffed paintwork leaves an impression of carelessness which is not borne out by the food here Perhaps someone could also find time to update the blog on the cafe s website potentially a useful resource 
neutral, Stopped in for cocktails with the in-laws to take in the views over the bank holiday weekend Nicely done out bar and a good cocktail list Free charge points for your phone was probably the best thing after the view Cocktails were ok but then the 26 for 2 gin and tonics and a half a lager seemed very pricey 
neutral,Used to go here quite a lot until we noticed that the staff were taking photos of the customers this was to say the least somewhat disconcerting 
neutral, Nothing special neither good or bad but convenient if you re in the area As with all chain pubs the food is standardised and unremarkable though if anything a bit overpriced for what s on offer 
neutral, Lots of nice detail nice decor good staff however very average food at high prices It certainly was underwhelming and I would rather support a local restaurant than another chain which felt soul less 
neutral, Superb value food [four of us had main course and pud for a total of 32 ] and friendly staff  BUT   the hotel part we do not recommend For the first time ever in hotels after four hours of trying we gave up on sleep because of the noise from the adjoining room [very thin walls ] and left the hotel at 2am There was no night staff so could not arrange a room swap so we chose to drive the two hour journey home  To give them their due when we phoned from home in the morning to let them know they said they would not charge us but the damage had been done Very disappointing way to celebrate my birthday 
neutral, Went to Jamies with family have been once before a few months ago which I enjoyed but this time came away feeling disappointed Generally felt that we were rushed through and the food was entirely average Will not be going back any time soon 
neutral, Went for Sunday Family breakfast  staff were friendly food good but not spectacular Had the traditional English breakfast which was good clean and edible Coffee that came with the breakfast included was filtered and quite tasteless WE did not partake in any Moroccan Dishes but perhaps on another time will The waiter was from Bangladesh and the waitress from Spain  The restaurant is in the Food Zone in South Croydon and has many other venues vying for trade 
neutral, Lunch with friends typical French style Convenient for Harrogate centre Good selection for lunch at areasonable price - must try dinner where the menu looks far better 
neutral,Good fish and chip takeaway Not quite by the Sea but worth the walk Nice staff and very clean and tidy 
neutral, An awesome building which is always impressive An ideal church for an atheist The drinks are good but over-priced as is the food It is worth calling in for a drink if you are close by but not a destination restaurant as it once was 
neutral, Standard but tad expensive pub grub Friendly & very quick service Beer 4 20 lamb shank was succulent 14 95 lemon sponge 5 95 Only 1 stop on free 423 bus from T5 & short walk from nearby big hotels Thistle Premier Inn T5 etc 
neutral,Good food but portions too large Service was very good and pub was clean Also plenty of car parking space 
neutral,We visited with 2 friends last night Service was very slow eventually we had to ask for a menu 30 minutes after ordering we were told the starter my wife had ordered had run out could she chose another   she ordered the leek and potato soup Unfortunately when it did arrive she was unable to eat it due to it being very over peppered That said the fillet steak and fish and chips were cooked to perfection some of the best meals we have had out in a while Just need to get the service sorted we weren t even asked if we wanted desserts and it would be a great place to eat
neutral, I ve been to Gaucho few times and it is always the same The ambient is nice not great the service good good wine selection and very good meat but the experience is not worth the price they charge you Also the side orders were not really good chips badly fried and mushroom too salty  So average with good meet but expensive for what it is 
neutral,Went to visit the architecture of the hotel which was closed off for a new years eve package The place looked dead at 700 PP We walked into the bar and got a lot of very strange looks although we were smartly dressed We were not the only ones other customers mainly walkers also got funny looks I asked for a drinks menu and almost thought they were going to say can you afford to drink here Hot chocolate was very good though nice atmosphere toilets are amazing if not confusing as they seem to me linked 
neutral, We chose the Founders as we were meeting friends for lunch and it was convenient for both of us despite some of the reviews on TA saying that the food was hit and miss  It was a hot Sunday afternoon and many people were enjoying the terrace with fine views over the Thames to the city I d booked a table a few days in advance and had asked for a high chair this wasn t at our table when we arrived but was quickly rectified The waitress was patient with us as we were a little slow to order 3 of our party had the Tower 42 burger and my wife and I had the steak and ale pie  The food didn t take long to arrive and there were plenty of chips with the burgers which were tasty Our steak and ale pie however was very disappointing We expected the pie to be homemade but this was something you d get from a chip shop and really disappointing There wasn t enough vegetables and the runner beans were old tough and stringy  We did order ice creams but after waiting for ages cancelled the order and left As a place for drinks great but I would not eat there as the food is expensive and not very nice 
neutral, Genuinly can not predict the outcome Been here a few times now and one second we have a lovely simply outstanding dish from a good menu  and then we wait a week for our next course which is simply substandard Do not recommened if your with children 
neutral,It s been well documented that Wetherspoons had decided not to have the traditional Christmas dinner on the Festive menu this year outrage across the media as the British public were in shock and anger of not being able to have a full turkey and veg dinner with a pint for 6 99 - I admit I was one of them  For the past 5-6 years I ve met an old colleague for this traditional lunch and even though we thought of voting with our feet and try Debenhams research done we decided to continue our annual pilgrimage to the Roebuck Ok I admit I do use more than once a year but the same thing happens 2-3 deep at the bar this at 1pm with only 2-3 staff serving no sense of who is next leads to chaos and frustration flip that to how quick the food comes the quality for the price and the price you have to decide for yourself  Overall what you see is what you get - but for me this time one star less for Mr Wetherspoon and his chain - standards slipping
neutral, Warm and friendly people Obviously popular with locals On site parking was a very big plus Food was good but not especially so A good place to go after a rugby match for easy parking and reliable food 
neutral, The 100 character minimum is rather inconvenient in this case as I would be happy to say simply adequate but I shall expand The Rusty Cutter is a long established Beefeater whose menu is indeed adequate Service was actually very attentive and pleasant with our waitress putting in a lot of effort although she was not clear whether they still sold sparkling mineral water Nachos could have been much more lovingly prepared but had plenty of flavours My partner s mixed grill included a steak which had gone considerably beyond the requested rare  I had ultimate fries which were very good but I challenge their existence as an alternative Surely the crisper on the outside and fluffier on the inside should be standard Are we to understand that regular fries are somehow sub-standard Perhaps they are for people who inhale food more than they chew it My plate-sized gammon steak was OK but peas had obviously been frozen to which I do not object but not made the full transition to hot to which I do  We were glad to have arrived before a substantial Sunday crowd but everybody seemed to be getting served Like I say adequate 
neutral,Right off the bat so Maidstone is not necessarily well known for star restaurants We lived in London for 10 years in Fulham  before moving near Maidstone and have developed a sophisticated Palate with visits to many starred restaurants dotted across London When I read the reviews here that the food is perfect and excellent  I have to strongly disagree It s actually really average  However I do think the staff are really friendly and the place has a nice decor and a good atmosphere Perfect for a drink or a coffee & croissant I d give it a 4 or even a 5 on the basis of those points  So if you are like us who can clearly tell the difference between amazing average and bad food and expect very good food here - I warn you not to listen to the reviews here about the food and definitely lower your expectations 
neutral, A thorough pleasant but un-inspiring meal which in fairness was all that was required Very competent friendly service Busy and rather noisy - a typical perfectly acceptable pub restaurant 
neutral, Having said that the seats are really comfy and sound quality is good  if only they were a bit less preoccupied with being cool and hip  
neutral, Dined here after reading all the good reviews Service was fine but the menu lacks any real hot curries that I could try I would go again as it has a nice and relaxed atmosphere 
neutral, stopped here for convenience as good location on side of busy road into cornwall was friendly enough and had locals and tourists side by side food was average but for the size and numbers was acceptable I would stop again 
neutral,I ve used this chippy for years having lived in Matlock most of my life and the only thing that lets it down is the consistency of the fish quality in particular the cod  sometimes you can get an absolutely delicious piece of battered cod nice and crisp with fleshy white meat other times the same fish can be a bit grey and slimy but cooked  We ve also had the odd occasions where the chips have been decidedly gritty other times perfectly done Prices are fairly average for fish and chips I normally have small fish small chips and a battered sausage which comes to around a fiver Service is good or at least I should say service has improved significantly over the past couple of years at least  We never choose to eat inside as the tables are those fixed ones with fixed chairs a bit like a military canteen  They could probably do a whole lot more with this place to make it more inviting for seated diners Will re-review in another year to see if any changes occur 
neutral, We came here on a Saturday evening with a strict instruction that we had to vacate the table by a certain time even though we arrived 40 minutes early   As a result the service was lightning fast and rushed  The menu is different and interesting - nice to see some unusual choices - however the reality is less exciting - the portions are very small and there is an element of style over substance the Eton Mess must reflect a 90 profit margin    It was approx 50ish per head without wine or drinks and really needs to decide if its an upmarket eatery or a trendy bistro as it was not worth the money  however the major problem was service - surly staff and some basic errors made it a less than upmarket experience  The whole evening felt as if the place was newly opened and they were still experimenting - it was packed so there is clearly room for something more interesting in Bristol than the usual restaurants  We won t rush back - and though it is expensive and interesting not a safe option for a special event   
neutral, Overall a good experience  I have been here so many time and very happy with everything  All the staff were very friendly I also took a friend for lunch today and very disappointed with my seafood bucani  It s like it was off  the seafood taste disgusting and it was very smell I even let my friend tried she almost throw up I didn t complain to waitress or anything because it wasn t theirs faults I m not sure I m I will go back there again now   
neutral,all the courses at our table were tasty and in nice portions but the restaurant is quite pricey  8 for generic starter or dessert and 15-25 for a main  
neutral,Went at lunch time and was seated immediately Had to wait an hour for the food but got free dessert Food was average but plentiful Kids menu great and lots for them to do like cinema screen and outdoor play area Cheap enough but you get what you pay for Cake selection good and also available to take away 
neutral, Found the food to be excellent and the service was OK The restaurant does seem to lack atmosphere We were a party of 3 and were sat in an alcove with another table of 8 people The only other busy area of the restaurant was another alcove around by the gents toilet This made the place feel very empty The lighting is so bright you can actually feel the heat coming off the bulbs the staff tried to dim the lights without much success In contrast the lighting in the gents toilet was very dim All in all a nice meal but not sure I would rush back 
neutral, Why oh why does this happen  6 months ago we had a delicious roast with a very good portion size Sunday 6th Dec we visit for my wifes birthday and i couldnt believe the amount of meat beef on the plate Half the amount too the previous visit One small slice Its was nicely cooked But there is no need for this  Customers expect something for their money at least i do Why do restaurants reduce portion sizes I know why you want too make more money  We were so hungry we just ate I thought the value was okay last visit for a roast but this was not So you get average score Sort this out you will lose customers 
neutral,Saw the menu outside and decided to give it a go Ordered the fish soup waitress nice girl came back - no Fish Soup  Whats soup of the day  I ask    There s no soup at all she said ok One fish platter and one seabass and prawns please There s no fish she says Man shouts from the kitchen We haven t had our delivery yet  Now this is Thursday at 1pm We are on the FISH QUAY Couple of metres in any direction are fish shops within 100 yards there are more fish suppliers than anyone could want and here there is NO FISH  Ok then Potato skins - yes now we re getting somewhere Spaghetti Bolognese please with Tagliatelle and the cuna pasta with Spaghetti She comes back rather sheepishly and tells me there is no Tagliatelli So I have Spaghetti  I have never ever visited an Italian restaurant that did not have Tagliatelli So the food arrived The potato skins were very nice - cooked just as I like them with 2 tasty dips The pasta dishes were really nice pasta cooked perfectly and with a generous helping of sauce We had Ice Cream next as it was part of the special lunch menu again very tasty So what to make of the place I asked for a business card so that next time I can call and see if the Fish delivery has arrived If it has then I may well return and see if they cook the fish as well as the pasta A few minutes later a group arrived and ordered the fish & Chips with Mushy Peas    and got it   Theres no need to have what must have been frozen fish on the quayside in North Shields  On the plus side cutlery and glasses were clean the salt and pepper pots worked and the toilet facilities although small were acceptable They could do so much better with what seems like very little effort 
neutral, We called in for a beer - it s exactly what you want in a pub staff are friendly and the place has a busy but reasonable ambience 
neutral, I ve been to Hache a few times now and it s always good  It does usually take a decent amount of time to navigate the menu because there are so many good options But the cheese burger is always good value the Louisiana is probably one of the best 
neutral, Went to Trattorias for Christmas lunch there was no Christmas atmosphere just like having a normal lunch and the staff seamed to all be walking round with long faces 
neutral, Unfortunately small portions are no longer available The portion is now too big and is cold before half eaten I hate wasting food It was my weekly treat especially as a coeliac sufferer they are gluten free I am very disappointed The cost is also 25 dearer I hope I can find another gluten free fish and chips 
neutral,The food and service are good once you get seated  unfortunately for some reason this one doesn t accept bookings so you have to turn up and out your name down on a waiting list  The more cynical amongst you might think that this is designed to make you but a few extra drinks  The bar area is nice but was very busy and we couldn t get a seat so had to sit outside  In fairness though this was a Saturday night  We arrived and gave our names and then had a pint  and we were seated soon afterwards so perhaps a 25 30 minute wait which wasn t too bad  Food is good and a wide range and reasonably priced  salad bar OK but just didn t seem as good as on previous visits
neutral, Called on on Sunday at it s business as usual dirty tables that need clearing  food ok drinks the best thing about it and the reason most people go it s needs some atmosphere as it could be really good 
neutral, Me & the girlfriend decided to reserve a table for an evening meal at Carluccios so I rang up to do so & was told that they could take no more bookings for that evening but if I was to turn up then they would find us a table Bizarre as this seems we were immediately seated on our arrival as there were plenty of free tables  Immediately on being seated we noticed the horrendous communal salt sitting on the table Why restaurants do this is beyond me as I certainly don t want to put salt on my food that other peoples fingers have been in  The waiter was very pleasant throughout our whole time in the restaurant & seemed very knowledgeable on what was on offer We opted for the savoury bread tin to munch with whilst we decided on the rest of the evenings food It arrived quickly with a variety of bread to choose from & complete with a small dish of balsamic dipping oil Some of the bread was ok none of it was good enough to want to order it again  & some of it was plain old stale & not appealing at all  For a starter we ordered the Mozzarella Fuza melting Buffalo mozzarella roasted peppers sliced Parma ham and rocket  I asked if this could be shared between the two of us It duly arrived in plentiful style on one big plate & with two small serving plates It was very nice as the ham was of a high standard However a little more roasted pepper would have been good as there was only a couple of slithers served with the dish  For the main meal the Trio di pasta was decided upon This gave us the option of choosing any 3 of the 12 pasta dishes & having them served as a taster option between the two of us We decided upon the spicy italian sausage with penne pasta the home-made meatballs with pasta ribbons and a mixture of mushrooms with egg pappardelle pasta All three were fine but nothing was outstandingly tasty Of the three we thought the mushroom dish was by far the tastiest & would happily order this one again as a main meal on its own The meatball dish seemed a little bland as the tomato sauce was almost tasteless however the meatballs were fine  Desert was possibly the highlight of the meal We chose a delicious fruit tart with italian ice cream & a gorgeous cherry sundae The fruit tart was of a particular high standard as the pastry was very crisp & packed full with a variety of fresh fruit  The bill was roughly 50 for the entire evening which included a couple of drinks each too So a reasonable price for three courses Overall it was a good evenings meal out Not the best we ve had but not the worst either We would happily return to try some of the meat dishes next time 
neutral, Have eaten at this Chaophraya once before for a special occasion and it was a fantastic experience and the food was excellent THIS TIME the food was average for the the expensive price charged and everything seemed hurried to get you in and out quickly to free the table Food  The Thai Green Chicken Curry was tasty but was spoilt by the lack of Chicken it contained It probably had less then a third of a Chicken breast in and only a couple of slices of vegetables so it was mostly liquid so seemed more like a soup The Asian Platter starter again tasty but spoilt as the portion was tiny for the 20 price 
neutral, My son and I went to the Great Nepalese basically because we were hungary and I had eaten there many years ago and enjoyed it The food was still great and for London reasonably priced about 40 for lunch for two including drinks  But the d€÷cor was sadly and shabbily neglected and the toilets down a steep staircase were in a dank basement The walls of the restaurant were covered in commendations from food critics and celebrities some dating back to 1983 and possibly earlier I d certainly go back for the food but not I m afraid for the elegance of the ambience I wouldn t take a person with disabilities who might need the lavatory 
neutral, The food here is great value for money tastes great and freshly made so I cant fault the food but  the service is another story the staff are not fluent in English and some times food can take a while to reach you staff are friendly but the poor guys working there have minimal understanding of the English language and etiquette so if you do go to eat here do be prepared to wait a while or order in advanced  The decor is moderate nothing too fancy but not the worst with comfortable seating and tables  I would recommend for the food but not for the service 
neutral,The food was ok a bit bland but not oily It claims to have Sri lankan dishes but just naming a few dishes after some Sri Lankan towns does not mean they are Sri Lankan dishes A big disappointment for me as I wanted Sri Lankan food The good thing was that at the end of the meal we were given a free drink on the house A nice touch So overall I would say that if you fancy a curry and are in Wymondham then give it a go but dont expect a stunning gourmet experience 
neutral,had the special menu one afternoon evening the pie was nice as was the mash onion gravy needed to be slightly runnier to be of use as it didn t poor out of the jug overall it was a nice quick meal for a decent price the cake after was great as always
neutral, The food is ok but seems to be a little down on how it used to be and is could be called bland  But its great for a party and makes up for the average food best to go in a bunch its great for a fun night with friends 
neutral, I like this place a lot see my review of July BUT there are worrying signs It is deservedly busy but the quality of service is creaking This Sunday lunch table not ready on time 40 minutes after we arrived before we saw any food order for Coffe forgotten and where have the friendly and attentive staff gone Certainly not behind the bar - of at least six staff on duty only one appeared to be doing any serving Saving grace still excellent food Stop trying to cram every cover you can through the door and focus on quality not volume and you will stay a special place to visit 
neutral, This is your average Wetherspoons pub A good choice of beers and lagers The food is OK and good value for the price Some people expect too much sometimes if you remember where you are and what you are paying you will not be disappointed 
neutral, Sharing plates small cramped tables shambolic service and primitive wine list I see one of this at any other corner nowadays Extra point for food which is as good as it should be for the price pity for the wine list that makes you feel like not drinking 
neutral, A very nice restaurant with limited menu at modest prices The staff were very friendly and available when needed I will go back 
neutral, You can t fault the food its good  However as a dining experience it leaves a lot to be desired  The restaurant is really a conveyor belt of people from dawn until it closes late at night  All shapes sizes families with kids in every conceivable kind of dress code assembles in the restaurant during the day  It s busy predominantly with tourists obviously directed in its direction by their hotel concierge s The service is indifferent to say the least and it is a long time since I have been in a restaurant and asked to vacate my table by one of what appears to be several managers working in house after only occupying the table for an hour and a quarter  This I was told so that they could set it up for the next customers and the table needed to be vacated  It has a reputation as one of the go to restaurants in London not for me I m afraid there are much more convivial places to eat without the ridiculous hustle bustle of the this place  
neutral, A group of us visited this tea room for lunch Most of our drinks arrived but without milk for the tea and coffee After several minutes I managed to catch the eye of a busy staff member to ask for some milk She didn t seem very happy about this and she placed it unceremoniously on our table without an apology  Most of our food arrived promptly However after several minutes both my soup and my wife s tea still had not arrived Again we had to approach a member of staff to ask for these items  I have to say that the soup was very nice and it came with a cheese scone which is a welcome touch  However our dining experience was somewhat marred by the service we received Some members of staff particularly two older women didn t seem at all interested I would not return 
neutral, we used to go here as our first option when arriving at our caravan a good place to get our fill before relaxing for the night we went there recently  and came away slightly disappointed  we thought the value and quality didn t seem the same as in the past  
neutral,The food was very tasty The monk fish dish we ordered had a good quantity of fish but the other meat dishes did not have a decent amount of meat  Price was a bit high for Chinese  Service was very good 
neutral, Went for lunch one Sunday and overall it was pretty average My wife had a jacket potato which was nice but nothing special I had the mixed grill the meat was well cooked and nice though the peas were stone cold and tomato not much warmer  It wasn t a bad experience but at the same time nothing special Not too expensive and it has nice decor inside 
neutral, If you want to serve food AND barista style coffee in the morning you need to double your baristas and machines Queue very long and slow moving 
neutral,Bar was horrendous to get served at due to barstaff not dealing with the queue in a normal matter Moved tables and informed the bar staff of the new table number which they didn t pass onto the kitchen staff All resolved in the end however  Other than that food was good for the pricing plenty of seating area inside and out 
neutral, We have been a few times but it s hit and miss We have had good meals and just ok meals Not much choice in real ales which is a bit disappointed A wide rarity of meals and a good atmosphere 
neutral, We went to the Hungry Horse Bath house because of the Hungry Horse MTGG reputation for good food at a good price We discovered it on a previous trip from Seaton whixh is a round trip pf about 60 miles 7 of us in the party and we were greeted by the young very pleasent bar tender who arranged a table tab and served our drinks took the food order which was quite a work up with 7 people who were not sure of what was what The food was average to good but did not arrive hot and the steaks which we asked for as med to well done wewe still quite rare After returning them for some more time under the grill they came back still underdone but this of course is a matter of preference not bad cookery The one thing that did consern us however was a lady who we took to be the manageress held court at a table near the bar with constant conversations with staff who were off duty and she did not seem to be aware of much around her going wrong She was like the overseer sitting on the chair and chatting Quite off putting really Another thing which allarmed me in particular was the sight of whar we presumed to be the chef in a vey greying white chefs jacket with an oven cloth in his hands drying dishes behind the bar   Didn t look hygenic to me at all The place was heaing in the summer when we were here last but it was quiet on our visit with only 5 tables being used The desserts were nice as for me desserts always are and after another glasse of excellent beer we left somewhat disappointed  75 00 lighter and not that impressed Back to Kingsteignton in the future There was little atmosphere There was little to draw us back for more so it is probably the last time we go there which is a shame for the bar tender who was the only one who REALLY tried for us He seemed to be everywhere and doing everything 
neutral, Walked in off the street last night after trying and failing to find anywhere to eat without a booking so the fact we managed get a decent meal means I have to not embellish the review score just because we managed to eat a decent meal  On my meal alone I would ve been tempted to give it 4 stars as it was lovely I loved the special of ribs jerk chicken and chips with slaw and for the price it s certainly competitive for London My 3 companions also very much liked their meals But I ve given it 3 stars as I have a few niggling issues with the place namely the fact that you could barely taste the alcohol in the pricey cocktails  I ordered a long island iced tea but was told that they had run out of gin so I asked for them to make up for it with extra vodka and rum but when I got my drink it only had a slight taste of vodka and LOTS of ice My girlfriend ordered a banana daiquiri and it basically tasted like a watered down pina colada It seems it would take a very long and very expensive time to get tipsy from the cocktails if that was your desire 
neutral, Our food was most excellent - dumplings for a starter were some of the best I d had in a long time Plus the other two dishes were very good Unfortunately we ordered a side dish of soft noodles for our 3-year old boy which was listed along with the steamed and fried rice in the menu The price was 6 50 and it was just a plate of plain thin noodles Strangely if you want it with bean sprouts it only costs 6 00 This dish seemed very overpriced given that a plate of rice is only 2 
neutral, I liked the basement style of the restaurant I understand that it is dark to create a special feeling to eating in the restaurant but it was a bit too dark for my liking I could not clearly see my food I also think the music was too loud everyone in the restaurant was shouting in order to have a conversation 
neutral, Good range of light lunches including excellent crab sandwiches Service was excellent and friendly good choice of cold or hot drinks A little pricey for what you get and you will definitely need cash in case your bill comes to less than 20 
neutral,Had a really nice meal service good nice atmosphere although we didn t book they found us a table Did tell the waiter that we wanted the sauce for steaks separate but they put them over the steaks no big deal Ask for the bill to find drinks bill was for 31 70p but only had 1pt larger at 3 80p 2 pts bitter at 7 20p 4 brandys at 14 40p splash of coke was 1 80p large dash 1 50P medium dash very over priced for just 7 drinks I could get 2 litres of coke for the price of a dash I know pubs have overheads but just think drinks we re well over priced 
neutral,Plenty of room in the downstairs stairs sitting area to have a quite meeting really convenient Coffee break very good but lacked a lunchtime offering like pret really needs a revamp cakes etc are ok but they are not having the option for lunch if they did I would probably have had lunch there as well 
neutral,I wanted to go here for a while It was a bit late on a Monday and I felt like the staff just wanted to go home The waiter sort of rushed our order and was suggesting dishes before we d had the chance to read the menu He did this for starters main and desert The food was good But I always fine Thai food good I have to say it was not better than any other Thai Restaurant that I have been to in London The desert was cold and its meant to be warm In the end we left sensing the staff wanted to go home 
neutral, After hearing a lot about this place I thought I d give it a try I went with my family and although I was initially impressed by what they did with the place I soon changed my mind When my non alcoholic mocktail arrived I was disgusted There was a piece of mint and a caterpillar crawling up the side I raised the issue with one of the staff and the attitude of this staff member was disgusting I will not be paying this place a visit again 
neutral,Yes the place was busy yes the fish and chips were good but not that good and we did feel a bit like herde cattle I think perhaps the best way to have these f and cs is probably as a take away It is probably a bit presumptuous to say they are the best just seems they are taking you a bit for granted
neutral, Pub too small for the number of customers food average and overpriced decor poor Car park exit dangerous No idea how it is rated 4th in Whitley Bay Area 
neutral, Very lively atmosphere but perhaps as a victim of it s own success seating was very crowded by the bar Although the rest of the pub looked a little more spacious We didn t eat here in the end Not sure about the whole idea of serving food on wooden boards and chips in old enamel cup- just a bit cheesy I think but the food looked delicious and the service appeared well organised and I would certainly be inclined to go back to eat Great feature was the absence of intrusive music Allowing conversation and the vibrancy of the customers to carry the atmosphere 
neutral, Went for breakfast after reading good reviews Waited a while for order to be taken but was busy Cooked breakfast had ok bacon but lots of white fat but quite a poor sausage tasted more economy than locally sourced Brown toast was nice 
neutral, We had been to this S&W before on the way back from the Wildlife Centre which is excellent and on Sunday we were in the mood for some mexican food and remembered this place Good bits - friendly quirky plenty for a 2 year old to look out  good service at the start of the meal Bad bits - For 15 pounds I expect the chicken burrito to be amazing - it was ordinary and very overpriced I work in Canary Wharf where you can sit down and have a Burrito at Wahaca for 6 95 and that is steak not chicken The other bad bits I could excuse but for the record they were really slow service at the end and despite us asking twice for a balloon - nothing turned up Unsure whether I would go back but probably will but be very selective and stick to a burger 
neutral, I would like to start by offering my unreserved praise for the serving staff Despite our reservation being at midday and therefore being extremely busy the staff were courteous and friendly at all times  I was with the same BPF party as Elizabeth D her review is below or above mine and I wholeheartedly agree with her statements about the staff and their help with a large mixed ability group  However the food was to be blunt awful Even at 15 for two courses I would still expect fresh food All of my food was cooked from frozen and tasted bland The turkey and stuffing was dry and tasteless the potatoes were average and the Yorkshire Pudding was overcooked I didn t have veg  Oh and the gravy could have been mistaken for treacle though the staff did water it down for some of our  fussier members  The only enjoyable part of the meal barring the company was the dessert Which is understandable since you d actually have to be trying to mess up an ice cream sundae  Now I ve been told that the Apple Cart usually has good food so maybe my poor experience was because of the extremely busy period Christmas holidays and midday and the fact that there was a deal on the Christmas meal 2 courses for 2 - 30 & 3 courses for 2 - 35 and therefore corners were cut to save on time & money  I hope that this will be my sole mixed erring on negative review of the Apple Cart and I can come back here and report nothing but a positive experience  Oh and as a last note for the Apple Cart I think I saw about 4-5 front of house staff rushing around dealing with over 50 customers Do yourself your staff and your customers a favor and bring in a few more hands to help out over the Xmas period  Visit was on the 17th of December 2016 between 12 30pm and 4 30pm 
neutral, My first visit to the Cricks under its new owners early on a Saturday evening to celebrate my sons birthday I had heard good reports lately but over not impressed At the bar they had run out of Stella Fosters and Stowford We bought a bottle of Australian Chardonnay for the meal but later after dining found that was the last bottle The menu looked similar to other pubs in Alresford with similar prices The starters and mains were served in good time and ample portions although the french fries advertised on the menu as seasoned were more like those served in McDonalds but not as well cooked My wives Sticky toffee pudding was served cold with a strange taste there was no sign of a waitress to complain to untill all other sweets were eaten No charge was made for the offending pudding 
neutral, The Clipper Restaurant is located in the centre of Padstow harbour and has the potential to be a great venue The entrance via the ice cream parlour does nothing to enhance the ambience of the restaurant However the interior is quite spacious and pleasantly furnished although a refurbishment could make a big improvement  I was warned not to have great expectations about the meal and therefore chose prawns in shells as a starter and fish chips and garden peas as a main course Both courses were good with large portions The wine was very ordinary The service and presentation was OK In general terms I would describe the food as average pub food There is a lack of atmosphere It would seem unnecessary to book a table This is not a romantic venue but vast improvements and vision could change things dramatically 
neutral, Myself and 9 mates went to this pub last night The first three real ales we asked for were either coming soon or had just run out The forth one we were told that it would be ready in 10 minutes as they were cleaning the pipes Surely this should be done before opening As we had already been waiting for 15 minutes to be served as there was only one person serving with a good 25 people waiting we decided to leave and go to The Blue Anchor 
neutral, A standard KFC if you ve had KFC before you know what to expect Good service plenty of parking nothing to complain about 
neutral, Very nice and modern appearance and staff were very attentive  We decided on the 4 course lunch for 25 which appeared to be good value noting the location and it was a Rick Stein restaurant  The start of black risotto with crayfish was to die for however after that it went downhill I can eat fish which still a little soft but the pollock was very under cooked in the middle and think if I put it back in the sea it might have had a chance of life The bread & butter pudding is a fav of mine but this was horrid The top had been blow torched and just tasted burnt and as for the fruit it was a game of can you spot a sultana   In summary think there s work to do if Rick wants to make his mark on Poole especially as there s plenty of competition to choose from Very disappointing noting this was meant to be a fish specialist restaurant 
neutral, Just been for a family meal at this restaurant and felt a little let down with the experience We arrived 10 minutes after opening and had to wait to be seated as there was only one member if staff We were seated and our orders were taken quite quickly When the pizza s arrived there was a couple of mistakes with the order these were rectified quickly enough The pizza itself was nice and plenty of salad but when it came to desert for my son they never had the lollies that he wanted and we were pretty much dismissed when asking for anything else The amount of money that we paid i thought the service would have been a little better 
neutral, After visiting many of the company restaurants we had high expectations about the alchemist on NYS The place itself is very nice so much bigger then spinningfield The place is very warm and welcoming We was given a nice booth witched overlooked the restaurant When I made my order there was a small error with my order and they had no problem in changing it to make sure I was happy so thank you very much for this However I thought they made a point clear it was my fault and not the restaurant They did make me feel uncomfortable for a bit as they kept coming over to see if we was happy  But over all it s a very nice pace good food and good service 
neutral, Good food and service at a fair price Not licensed to serve alcohol Some dishes rather salty but all very tasty Open kitchen can be viewed Rather basic surroundings but very clean Will definitely visit again 
neutral, Prices were steep but we used a Gourmet card which gives 2 for 1 on at least 2 courses food only  Ordered a drink with no ice and it came with ice I commented on this and she said she d change it for me which was appreciated  I didn t like the look of all the starters so I asked what the soup of the day was - it was mushroom and blue cheese Exotic choice but I don t like blue cheese but she told me it had gone down well with other people I tried it and I didn t really enjoy it but that s my own fault for not liking too much food  The starters came were cleared and the mains came very quickly Excellent service each time delivered by the same woman who knew we had ordered using a Gourmet card But then no sign of her  she d disappeared It was ages before someone came and asked if we wanted puddings but phrased it as I suppose you won t really want puddings will you which was really negative  We did and asked to see the menu We ordered our puddings and it took an age to come The waitress had no idea what the fruit crumble was no what flavour ice cream they sold new staff maybe  Eventually the puddings came but then nobody came to clear up the plates for ages I was tempted to just walk out but we called someone over and asked for the bill Sure enough the bill came again after waiting about 5 minutes and there was no Gourmet discount attached lack of communication after the first lovely waitress had disappeared  The bill was changed merely crossed out a few items and recalculated the price rather than reprint a receipt  and we paid and left It took 2 hours for 3 courses The place was dead so not sure why it took so long Felt like really poor service No goodbyes from the staff or thankyous either  Overall food pricey shoddy service but a couple of members of staff seemed pleasant but the food was elegantly laid out and looked the part I wouldn t recommend Kennedy s just because of the prices and the poor service 
neutral, The food at the Smoke House was really good We had pork scratchings with guacomole followed by pulled pork and spiced roast brisket on a dual platter arrangement We only needed one portion of each of these between the two of us and we washed it down with large glasses of really nice American beer  The food is great and different but you couldn t well I couldn t eat it often And the place would definitely not suit vegetarians  The service was iffy When we arrived they would not let us choose out table and they said that the one we wanted was already booked even though there were several tables where we indicated some not laid up This was all so off-hand and so patently unreasonable that I would have left immediately if I hadn t wanted to avoid embarrassing my partner By the end of our meal they had removed the cutlery from some more of the tables and there was no sign of anyone else coming into the restaurant  The food wasn t really quick but it didn t take all that long to come to the table and as I say it was certainly worth the wait We shall probably go and look at it again if only to see if they have done anything about staff training 
neutral, Whilst visiting family in Cleethorpes we went to the wellow so one of our sons could watch a football match on sky Service was okay the food was disappointing a bit like glorified ready meals I would not eat here again 
neutral, Went for dinner and thought the menu sounded exciting - a British spin on tapas style  Portions were small even for a tapas style but the food was tasty The beef carpaccio was taken straight from a freezer and was served on the plate frozen The dishes looked quite pretty but a lot of it is just visual garnish e g a few peas or beans scattered across the plate  Style over substance mostly  Thought it was a bit overpriced as we ordered a lot of sharing plates more than 3 per person and still left hungry  Probably better as a lunch venue than for dinner 
neutral, Unfortunately a typical average restaurant There is so much that attracted me to this restaurant but at the end of the day the food is only adequate Only nice feature is the introduction of Dim Sum which to be fair is pretty good so for that I would recommend 
neutral, Could do with an upgrade Food is just standard and i think it is mainly microwaved Staff are not that friendly 
neutral, Called in for morning pint Cheery service and reasonable pint Good large seating area outside Returned about 6pm for a couple of steak an chips with mushrooms Sat inside and served food within 15 minutes It was fine and not much left on our plates Would not rave about the place but no real complaints either Staff worked hard to serve everyone and clear tables when they were clearly very busy and under pressure 
neutral, Certainly the place to come for fish and for evening out when in Folkestone a stylist and well laid out restaurant with inside and outside tables providing a great panoramic view of the harbour The service was very good and the amusing spoof shipping forecast suited an ex-mariner like me  Sadly whilst the food was OK it did not match the expectations provided by the decor and service of the restaurant Paying extra for potatoes or chips I found annoying and not what you expect in a fish restaurant and bumped up the price beyond value for the quality Although to be fair the balance of flavours on the plate was good it was not sufficiently exciting to produce a wow factor for the price  Next time I will take my aperitif in the bar above the restaurant to enjoy the view and ambience and then eat in the Smoke House restaurant just behind It has the same management a view of the harbour and good fish and chips at around half the price 
neutral, A funny one The restaurant is relatively new and decorated to a reasonable standard On a Friday night it had a good buzz to it Expectations were high as we sat down  Food was average with portions definitely on the smaller side Waiting staff were smart with their ties but not particularly knowledgeable even when it came to the drinks  Having had 3 courses didn t leave feeling full Didn t feel desperate to revisit Plenty of better Indian places to visit 
neutral, Good quality Indian food with a large menu  Staff helpful and friendly  Main criticism is the lack of a waiting area while the food is being cooked with no adequate seating  Not everyone likes to wait in a nearby pub like me    
neutral,We visited here on our way home after doing the Way of the Roses ride I m a big fan of Wetherspoons restaurants and I ve never tried a curry from one until this visit  The Beef curry that we got was OK - there was plenty of beef in there for sure but in no way can they compete with Indian restaurants if they serve Poppadums that are out of a packet Naan breads that taste like the ones you buy in vacuum packed bags in supermarkets - and rice that tastes like a microwave meal  It was about 7 for the meal including a pint which is very good value the beer was excellent  - however serving plastic food is never a good idea - you compare this to the steaks that they serve up at Wetherspoons which on some occassions is comparable to high quality restaurants then I do wonder why they bother with curries  The staff were great and I don t blame the pub here as its a chain and they have to serve the food on the menu - having said all this I ve had a few worse curries in Indian curry houses I know if I d ordered a steak or mixed grill it would have been far better 
neutral, My wife and I had an evening meal and breakfast the following day Only one waiter working during the evening and although he worked hard he needed extra staff could have used a hand Food was very nice cooked perfectly and came out in good time Only issue was the wait for the bill but can t be blamed on the waiter Breakfast the following day was chaotic X2 members of staff waiting same waiter from the previous day was one Had to ask for more plates for the hot food had to ask for butter food was warm Wasn t the same as Premier Inn breakfasts we ve had before seemed lost Would have the evening meal again but probably not the breakfast 
neutral, I have eaten here before and the food was exceptional however this was a couple of years ago and in the summer this time was winter and very quiet maybe just a bad day waited a long time for food and when it finally came out it was warm not hot shame as this place has a great location right on the coast perfect for boat watching even in winter I will return but hope this was a one off 
neutral,We stayed in the New Inn for two nights so had dinner and breakfast there twice  Starting with the best item the food was good value you got a lot for the price and the meat was excellent I believe locally sourced  This was evident at breakfast as well There were a few well-kept ales available and a good selection of wines  The rooms also were very nicely decorated and furnished - comfortable bed small but serviceable telly clean and modern bathroom we were happy to spend time chilling out in there between excursions Which was lucky because the decor of the main pub was pretty haphazard and soul-less think Ikea dining tables with chintzy chandelier lights and I would not have wanted to spend any additional time there  What makes this an average rating though was the service - immediately upon arrival literally bags-in-hand we were told that we had to book the restaurant in case they booked up No offer was made to hold a table for ten minutes while we thought about it and in the end there were plenty of spare tables throughout the evening The big-and-comfortable food on sale just didn t really match up with what was then a rather formal approach to service Upon leaving we were told checkout time was 10am despite them knowing that the booking site we used was telling everyone it was 11am - something I feel they could have sorted out by now and no attempt was made to accommodate us further  I d look elsewhere first if I was back in the area - although I d come in for lunch or dinner if I was close 
neutral, Went here for a late lunch on Sunday It wasn t actually that busy considering the great weather The service was a total shambles  The lady who took our drinks order left the order at the bar then went home as it was the end of her shift followed by at least 2 of her colleagues The drinks  a round of 7 mainly soft drinks took over 15 minutes to come with the bread ordered at the same time an additional 10 minutes  We finally managed to place a food order which took a further age to come  On the whole the food was actually rather good although I had to go in search of sauces and further drinks  This may sound like I m moaning I m not however if you open up a place for people to come and eat make sure you have enough staff to cope with demand    
neutral, If you ve been to a Costa before you pretty much know what our experience was like This one is a little cramped and the service somewhat slow compared to others otherwise OK 
neutral, LOADS OF HYPE amazing sea bass ceviche AMAZING Like I wanted it 10x over  that was about it  Then you realise that the art is crappy graffiti behind foggy cracked plexi-glass Then you go to the toilets and OH GOD THE HORROR there are NEON SPLATTER PAINITNGS that GLOW IN THE DARK So after vomiting everything you ve already eaten you hope to fill up on some solid bites But thats precisely all that you get bites One piece of steak One bite of sushi A half bite of chicken  It gets sadder as the dinner goes on Don t believe the hype They put purple cubey things on your food and all the gays in Soho get excited and Instagram it Go somewhere with substance 
neutral, As curry lovers we went here based on their inclusion in the the Independents top 50 curry houses during a recent week in Cornwall  Had barely sat down when the very surly and brusque waiter don t think I saw a single smile all night asked for our drinks order as he handd me the winelist - ok so we went on a quiet Tuesday out of season but still Drinks VERY pricey 7 50 for a pint of lager and an archers and lemonade had cheaper in London  Food wasn t bad on a par with a reasonable local curry house if more expensive but nothing to write home about In fairness portions were generous but top 50 UK not based on our experience  Nice decor but despite bein one of only 5 tables we were still seated out in the middle of the room at a tiny table felt a bit like school dinners On balance doubt we d return 
neutral, Used this place a few times over the years It is what you would expect from a set price buffet The food is not WOW in good or bad way it s good for what you pay Free refill s on hot an cold soft drinks are priced a bit high 2-50 but if you have a few then caching All in all don t expect the ritz But can not go wrong for a cheap ish all you can eat Oh and the puds are good    
neutral, Being visitors to the area and living very far away from the sea we had a craving for seafood and looking for a good place to go we thought this would be a great option We decided to treat ourselves to the sharing seafood platter and for 64 we were expecting great things The lobster and crabmeat ramekins were the stars of the show - exceptionally yummy However the prawn skewers were very over cooked and quite tasteless and the bread was very hard We also had salad on the platter unfortunately this was underneath a hot lobster covered in butter - needless to say it was pretty inedible by the time we were served it I think it is nice food which could be better which is overpriced due to the location Friendly staff and great location made up for it 
neutral, Went for a pizza as reward for my youngest doing well at the start of her high school year and we went on 29 09 2014 Had to wait for a table Busy for a Monday So that was a good sign We had a starter of garlic bread and very nice it was to We ordered a pepperoni pizza and hot sausage pizza They turned up in good time except the pepperoni was minus the pepperoni Waitress admited it was her fault Mine was kept warm why hers was re cooked They tasted very nice We both agreed that where we sat was like sitting in the hallway And adjacent to the kitchen Service was good Remember to get a voucher off internet Twenty five off food bill 
neutral, As with other reviews I thought this was a little expensive but more on that later   The menu offers quite a good choice if started and mains We opted to share the fish tikka made with salmon We were a little disappointed to find only 2 small pieces of fish one each at 5 25 but what we had was tasty enough  For mains my partner had a king prawn and spinach biryani  11 95 - a larger portion and I had my favourite - chicken Achari  9 95 with 3 x chapattis Both meals were very tasty and the chapattis were warm light and fluffy We swilled this down with a pint of Becks and a jug of water  The service was good and our waiter was pleasantly chatty We were shocked when the bill arrived at 38 25 OK we re from Bradford where there s a bit more competition and prices are keener but I felt the starters and mains were overpriced But and it was a big BUT I never looked at the price of the chapattis when ordering I knew what I wanted and was gobsmacked to find they were 1 60 EACH   Yes that s 4 80 for three chapattis These were the most expensive I ve ever come across and as I said at the start left a bitter taste  Overall a nice place with decent staff and clean toilets but one of the most expensive curries we ve ever had The price of the chapattis would probably stop me going back The mains were overpriced by a couple of pounds each as was the starter Such a shame - even our waiter was a little embarrassed   
neutral, This is a decent restaurant no question The staff and the venue are charming and the prices reasonable The fact that there is a three month wait for a table on a Saturday night is however unfathomable The food just ain t that good  If you are going to serve a piece of grilled or pan-fried fish with no sauce or even a herb butter you do need to cook it properly and ensure that the skin is crispy and delightful or removed altogether Even then you are pushing your luck in a place that presumably considers itself to be a fine dining environment My turbot was barely cooked slightly translucent in the middle with floppy grey skin that did the dish no favours at all This is pretty basic stuff and is completely incompatible with a  1 in Cambridge rating Following this with an ice cream dessert that was plainly not home-made did not improve the situation  Having said all that I would recommend Il Piccolo Mondo because its plus points are many just don t expect to be blown away by the culinary experience 
neutral, Location The pub is surrounded by trees and there is a lake adjacent to the pub Great car park with lots of space  Atmosphere The pub has a cosy atmosphere tastefully decorated with tapestry and paintings  Food The food is good and comes with generous portion  Service The service is mediocre I have to walk around and look for the menu myself  Price The food is reasonably priced With an average price of 18 per person for an evening meal 
neutral, Not knowing Bury St Edmunds we d asked for a recommendation for somewhere to dine at lunchtime and One Cannon Brewery was suggested It was good that food was still being served at 2 15 pm when we arrived A reasonable Rioja is served by the glass If I were a beer drinker I m sure that the ales produced on site would have been excellent  The food was ok but there was nothing outstanding though portion sizes were reasonable   
neutral, We were here in September before heading off to the town hall for a comedy night First time visitors The service was nice and friendly and were seated within minutes of arrival It was buffet night The food was in plentiful supply as you would expect The food itself was pleasant enough The pricing matched it You get what you pay for 
neutral,Having enjoyed food service and atmosphere on previous visits this time we were very disappointed Service was slow and occasionally forgetful  food was acceptable but not always very hot and it was generally very noisy making it difficult to chat It seems they have relaxed their standards a bit too far so unfortunately we are unlikely to return
neutral, Visited with a group of colleagues on a Thursday evening On entry we were shown to our pre-booked table with no fuss to be presented with a bewildering array of menus and flyers for various deals and offers to look through Thankfully some of the party had visited before and were able to guide we first-timers through the choices on offer  Our drinks order was taken quickly but they seemed to take an age to arrive which was odd since the place wasn t at all busy and sadly this set the pattern for the rest of the evening  We ordered starters and mains The starters took 35 minutes to arrive The food itself was average at best but perhaps this is to be expected from a chain There was another sizeable wait for the mains and when they arrived it was obvious that some of them had been sitting around under heat lamps for a while so the kitchen co-ordination was perhaps somewhat lacking The portion size of the mains was perhaps a little on the small side for the big eaters in the party but that s always a matter of personal opinion  Overall an average experience and if we hadn t been in a group with lots to talk about I think the slowness of the service would have been more of an issue On our experience this certainly isn t a place to go if you re in a hurry 
neutral, The menu limited but the food is good It s a handy place to stop for a meal if you are visiting Furness General Hospital Give it a go the food is at a reasonable price 
neutral, We visited the Devonshire on a Wednesday evening and having read so many positive reviews on TA was looking forward to eating here  Upon arrival I noticed an unpleasant odour in the restaurant it was hard to describe but certainly an organic smell While not untidy or overtly dirty it is my opinion that the eating area would benefit from a good clean the wall adjacent to our table was covered in food stains  The menu offers a decent variety of honest British food at reasonable prices On arrival the food is served in generous portions and is of an adequate standard  The serving staff were very pleasant helpful and friendly but the service a little on the slow side especially considering the restaurant was not busy  Not an awful experience but not good enough to encourage a return visit  
neutral, Our coffee and cakes were very nice with good portion sizes But it was slightly ruined by the noisy preparation of food and drinks in the nearby kitchen pay area e g blending of smoothies milkshakes etc 
neutral, Went simply becuase of the name and his past restaurants Never a good idea to rely on a name to give you the best experience especially when that person is not actually cooking Great location saw it in the daytime great views out to sea but we dined at night so no view which was ok Staff very welcoming and all very nice and experienced with good service Small restaurant perhaps 20 tables 4 which were empty all night  Very dissapointed in the decor basic white chairs which had been bought from a jumble sale job lot all shapes and sizes and had been hand-painted and now need a re-paint Basic cheap white tables In fact the whole place looked like it had been done on the cheap except the prices Bread came on a wooden platter but no side plates Very small menu and had a job choosing something we liked Sardine starter was bland Main course of sea bass was very good my wife said I had the Gooose which was also very good The pudding menu was not very appertising so we didn t have any The wine list printed on brown board was hard to read in the soft light but very little choice and on the expensive side as was a bottle of Hix beer We went out of our way to eat there and I wouldn t make the effort again much better and cheaper places to eat in Devon The price although fairly expensive wouldn t have been an issue if we had the WHOW factor but it was just a expensive evening meal 
neutral, It s simple By far the best beer in Paignton In frequent visits the staff have been both helpful and friendly But   the door staff  security  bouncer is rude and aggressive So much so we won t be returning Not even sure why Henry s have him at the door - your customers tend to be quiet types who like a good pint 
neutral, Not bad but not as good as it makes itself out to be Good service nice atmosphere disapointed with the food Pricy for what it was 
neutral, Dropped in for Sunday lunch  lovely garden area warm and cosy inside  lovely staff and great service sadly let down by rather bland Roast Beef  rather tasteless roast potatoes rather dry and again tasteless  Chef lets down what is otherwise a lovely place for a drink  or possibly more important the meat supplied is tasteless doesn t excuse dry tasting roast potatoes  
neutral,Several of the items on the main menu including the specials weren t available Had to go with fourth   choice Food was ok but menu is a bit repetitive after all this time and needs a revamp 
neutral, visited the Garden Centre only to use tyhe cafe which my memory served me from the past had been very good Had fish and chips which was considering the quality overpriced Service was good and the staff were friendly Pity the food wasn t as good as I remember 
neutral, This bar used to be a grotty estate pub but it has been bought out and had a makeover The owners are really trying have done the place up serve good food put on live music and extended the opening hours Please try it they deserve to succeed 
neutral,Food absolutely amazing We sat near the kitchen and marveled at what was coming out Some amazing venison lamb et al made it s way to our table Strong cocktails when we sat down as well Downside was service We had to ask for a wine list and for long periods of our lunch were ignored by the waiting staff 
neutral, Visit on a sunday afternoon it was very busy at time of visit 3 45pm  As our guests had not arrived by that time we partook in a drink service at the bar was efficient We were shown to our table in due course The menu was read bearing in mind that this is a Steakhouse not all the steaks were available Our order was taken with amendments which were agreed with the kitchen via the waitress There was a considerable wait before our meal was served not as ordered agreed I accept the resaurant was busy but no excuse to get order wrong DONOT dine here if you are in a hurry but that said the food itself was good Car park full and no parking on roadway double yellow lines alround 
neutral, Arrived at Restaurant at 9pm there were 7 of us I think the gentleman was a manager who served us short stocky man very abrupt we all thought we had done something to upset him Infact it turned out to be a joke We started to order the dished by number he quickly and very abruptly said we need names of dishes not numbers then we were scared to upset him any more he kept coming over to us asking us if we had finished the Bill came to 93 I asked him for a receipt he replied this receipt is for us I said I want to see what we have had he was very taken back If you want redness this is a good restaurant to come to The food was average nothing special the nan was good apart from that I don t think we will be revisiting 
neutral, This is basic functional food and served quickly  It was ok nothing flash but was good value for money  The service was good - the waitress was very attentive  Would we go again - probably yes if we wanted a quick burger 
neutral,Nice layout & decor throughout which lends itself to the character of the building Food can be a bit variable in quality which lets it down however
neutral, Party of 16 arrived for a Birthday celebration  orders taken  drinks arrived - Then a problem in the kitchen called for a complete evacuation - So we were unable to try the Ribs - Better luck next time 
neutral, My partner and I visited here on Thursday 26th September The food was excellent however this was spoiled by the rude staff and poor customer service As we were paying nearly 30 for our food and visiting Rick Steins we were expecting better I would recommend buying your food to take away save money plus no rude staff 
neutral, I stayed here for 2 nights The room was quite dated and slightly cold There was a portable heater available though The staff were pleasant The food was lovely and the breakfast a real surprise I was informed that the plans are to upgrade the rooms and also the Wi-Fi which I was unable to connect to in my room Overall a pleasant stay and with improvements this Hotel will be superb as it is on the doorstep of town 
neutral,not been there for a recently Customer service needs an upgrade there is 1 friendly middle aged chap Its right next to the bus when i get off from work and im always starving Late night venue Expect nothing special in customer service but pizzas fresh and tasty
neutral, Difficult to rate the restaurant in one word  Food excellent service bad We have been to San Carlo across the road many times Friends have urged to try Cicchetti - so we did arriving early 12 noon as suggested so it wasn t busy We had drinks and 3 starters which all appeared promptly in sequence - fine - but then I don t know what went wrong I had 3 glasses of a nice Sicilian red wine whilst waiting for the next course - our main course During the one hour that we waited occasional apologies were made for the delay Unfortunately we had other things to do in Manchester and it reached a point where we asked for the bill and were preparing to leave without having the main course This was enough as though by magic for the food to arrive We were offered drinks and coffee on the house to be fair but I am afraid time was pressing and we had to go Whilst I can understand that people like the atmosphere and the food I did get the feeling that perhaps regular customers were getting more attention than us Tables adjacent to us although arriving later ate and left before our main course arrived It is unfair to judge a place on one visit - they all have off days - but I feel that in the long term we will be happier across the road in the main restaurant Pity I am sure it s great fun with friends if you have the time 
neutral, Good value More of a quick Chinaton-like restaurant Food solid with nasi goreng and beef rendang etc Staff not too attentive but quick Can recommend if loo 
neutral, Noisy couldn t make ourselves heard Staff were fine and helpful but the food was not great With the choice of Japanese restaurants in London this one come well down my list Try Defune now that is good 
neutral, Very attentive staff Had a tasty burger and unlimited ultimate chips Good value for the money Had a large menu with good variety 
neutral, Food was good but had to ask twice for hot air to be switched on it was cold and radiators where not on It spoilt a lazy afternoon with our two grandchildren 
neutral, food was ok nothing more hard to determine what to order when the staff inform you of everything being the best on the street the manager often tries a hard sell on the door 
neutral,We were looking forward to this as it was advertising their carvery as superior The actual pub and restaurant had been done up very nicely the greeting was pleasant and the FOH staff polite Unfortunately that is really where the good finishes the carvery was on offer at an adult price or a childs price 4 cheaper than the adult but if you ordered the chicken the portion was the same size 1 2 a chicken When this was questioned we were told well we have only been open a couple of days and are still finding our feet All the Yorkshire puddings were burnt and the poor lad on the carvery was trying to cut the meat with blunt knives which even his steel could not put an edge on I can only say good luck to them and we will not be visiting again Being told at the door to pay at the bar and get your ticket then queue for your food and then find a table is not really the way forward Having been in catering a number of years you need to get 1 your margins right from the moment you start selling and 2 your customer service correct Superior this was not and if it carries on the way it was this Sunday I think it will also be shutting down again as you can get a similar meal after being seated at a number of other places in Gosport for a fair bit less 
neutral,The undeniably large selection of dishes on the menu card comes at a price Not in monetary terms but if you like fresh vegetables with your Sunday roast this is not the place for you Reasonable value for money but not the kind of cooking you d rave to your friends about Sometimes extremely noisy due to this being a meeting spot for groups going to away sports fixtures Sky Sports TV doesn t help as it s mainly soccer that they show 
neutral,Stopped Over for fireworks show just a little walk about 6mins from the beach Has a small bar attached to it Only down side is no free parking
neutral, We booked this restaurant in advance on the basis of the web page as one of our party wanted a seafood platter Legends offer a menu that covers most bases so a varied choice for the others The restaurant itself was comfortable but very noisy as it was full and it was too cold to sit outside The outside tables in the summer must be very pleasant with views across the bay On ordering we were advised it would be about a 30 minute wait as they were busy As they advertise their food as freshly cooked I could understand some waiting time However this ended up being a 45 minute wait for the meal far too long considering what we ordered was mostly pre-prepared anyway A seafood platter a burger and a hot rock steak  This is where the meal becomes divided the seafood platter was very tasty and well prepared and both the burger and the steak were very tasty Sue said it was the best steak she had ever tasted and she usually rates her meals on the vegetables However the salad accompaniment to the meals was an afterthought and the fries that came with the burger were just that out of a bag tasteless fries not the nice chunky chips you see on the web page and the new potato option was overcooked and watery After waiting that long for the meal I did not want to have to wait again for more potatoes so we ate what we could of them A shame as they were nice potatoes  All in all a nice gimmick with the hot rocks and care taken with the main ingredients but let down by a lack of attention to detail with the peripheries and the wait 
neutral,Been coming here over the years many times since it opened as we live walking distance around the corner Its clean staff smart and service of but the food is not right I held back writing this as thought the previous 2 meals were just so so and less than the norm but went again the other night and place was relatively quiet but food was just the same  For get the wooden boards and chips presented in wire mess  Its basic food that is overpriced  Really hope the new Toby opening focusses their mind because I think the building is great
neutral, Breathtaking view Clearly the selling point of Aqua Shard But 12 quid for a salad Seriously I wouldn t be willing to accept such a price even if the salad was twice the size and tastier which wasn t the case Nevertheless the place has a good vibe and is perfect for a romantic date 
neutral, A group of us visited this restaurant and the food was of good quality fresh and reasonably priced However the service was slow and we were made to feel as though we were an inconvenience 
neutral,The sushi was very good The environment amazing as far as decoration is consenerd A bit slow the service which was the only downside to it 
neutral, I have walked past Kench & Bibesy every single morning and evening since they opened on the 20th November Today was the first time they had a menu outside to help sell their wares  Three sandwiches @ 5 each and some soup @ similar  Roast pork with crackling Beef Brisket with mustard sauce Lamb - didn t read any further as I wanted some tasty brisket  Nice fast service from the very helpful waiter front of house Both myself self confessed foodie of all things meaty and my lunch partner good Jewish boy knows his brisket bother ordered the brisket and a coke  Firstly the venue is nice across the road from Smithfields market so no excuse to not have great produce The inside is very minimal but in a nice way compact tables which are big enough  All orders are from the chalk boards so maybe they change their menu on a regular basis On the tables we found a very long drinks menu on the pricey side for the area but some nice variations on cocktails  The food arrived really quick which when lunching in the city is essential the torpedo rolls were filled with a nice amount of beef a few leaves and nothing else There was talk of a mustard sauce and confirmation of a mustard sauce from the waiter front of house chap Such little taste we asked for English mustard to add some extra flavour  The problems here are as follows  The bun was far too dry for the amount of beef They need a much tastier cooking sauce to accompany the beef when you re cooking meat for a very long time you lose the taste of the meat somewhat and you have to rely on putting flavour into the sauce with the meat to keep the whole mixture tasty and enjoyable I don t think the meat was bad but it could have been SO much more flavoursome Once you have that sauce meat combo right you can put it on a dry sponge and people will eat it like it s their last meal On this occasion the bun was so dry that when it got wet from the cooking sauce it broke up so you finish the meal licking your fingers but not in the way I want to be licking my fingers  The situation with the meat could be turned around in a night if the kitchen choose another recipe for their brisket  However my major gripe is with the price of soft drinks There is no way on earth anywhere should be charging 3 05 for a small coke which was mainly ice This is not fair to customers and it is not the route a new restaurant wants to be going Yes 5 for a hot sandwich is good value in London and in fairness outside of London also By filling the restaurant with people hungry for GOOD hot sandwich fillings and charging 1 less for a coke they should be onto a winner  Hopefully they will sort these small problems out because I would like to eat there on a more regular basis as long as the meat and sauce is of a better quality taste and the price of a coke comes down to around the 2 mark  this place could pack out on a regular basis like the chinese restaurant that used to fill these walls but only if they pick up their game and put a bit more love into the quality of the brisket  The other meats could have been fantastic but with the brisket which is the wettest of the three feeling dry in that bun What must the others have been like I d urge people to try this place out as this is only two mens views Given more customers and more time to pick it up a bit and they might just be the next best thing in the area  p s they have a downstairs bar which is behind a secret wall and looks a little like a sex dungeon I d go back for that 
neutral, Went on a Saturday evening recently not booked and found it not too busy We were welcomed and shown to a table quite quickly  I had celeriac soup with three macadamia nuts which I could see poking through the soup such was the lack of depth It was very tasty but only just covered the bottom of the soup bowl so I finished it within no more than two minutes and at 5 50 was a real profit maker Twice as much would have been a small portion Wife had scallops which she said were very nice  I had kippers for a main course and it was difficult to remove the main bone strip and then I found out they were chewy and nearly cold so sent them back Several minutes later two new ones appeared looking exactly the same as the others and again I had the same difficulty removing the main bone strip and the same unappetising texture of the flesh They were almost certainly cooked beforehand and then frozen being reheated in a microwave probably They certainly weren t fresh as I am an avid kipper fan and know a decent one when I see and taste it and even thawed pre-frozen fresh kippers will do the business They need to change tack on this because the quality was very poor  Chips and courgette fritters were nicely presented and hot Wife had fish and chips which again she said was quite good  Service was good cost was reasonable but let down by a small portion of soup and a pair of not very nice kippers  Not as good as our last visit 18 months ago 
neutral, A great location in Covent Garden We ate early in the evening and the service was prompt and the staff were very friendly The food was average The chips weren t good- they were McDonalds style fries without the potato The choice of beers was really poor as well Its ok for a quick snack but that s all 
neutral, Quit smoking in January and was looking forward to experiencing all the different tastes on offer in Fuittion Blended fruit juices were good but not worth the 3 you pay for them Had a sit down lunch and as nice as the Chicken bacon and avocado sandwich was was it worth the money No sorry it wasn t especially as I had no option of a hot side and I detest Coleslaw The waiter gave me every option under the sun with regards to seasoning mayo butter etc which was understandable seeing as they offer GF and non dairy options but I d rather he asked I had any dietary first before going into his long spiel I applaud them for what they re doing but it s not for me 
neutral, Arrived just after the main Sunday lunch rush but managed to find a couple of tables to pull together You order food at the bar and were advised it may take about 40 minutes to be served OK We had starters and mostly Sunday Roasts with one Thai Green Curry for our party of 9 The food arrived quite quickly was good standard pub grub and the prices were very good No frill service but it was what it was and the staff were very pleasant Drink prices for beers and wine were quite reasonable Nice Cr€—me Brulee to follow 
neutral, Nothing offensive here with a nice menu reasonable interior and a nice small garden for those 2 weeks a year it gets used Never had a bad meal and do go back Surprised to see bad reviews 
neutral, We had a lovely meal at Yummy s the food was generally good the service attentive but not enough staff to cope with the number of customers as two people seemed to be looking after two rooms between them  Even so it was an enjoyable evening until I got the bill For what we had it seemed very expensive indeed so we won t be returning 
neutral,I was in town on a business trip and the barman at the hotel recommend this Indian restaurant I went with a colleague The place was busy and we were shown to our table by a grumpy rude waiter The menu was surprisingly cheap and had all the traditional dished My lamb bhuna was good and my colleague chicken tika was similarly good 
neutral, Views are amazing wouldn t go there for breakfast as the service is poor and it s help yourself to Starbucks type food and drink If it s cold outside be sure to wrap up as there is no heating in the viewing areas  Good for a free visit but book in advance 
neutral, This Pizza Hut isn t as hygienic as others The buffet table has food everywhere  The food is ok but still not as good but staff are very friendly 
neutral, My wife and I ate here a few years ago while travelling home I really looked forward to a post races meal last Sunday and repeating a lovely experience Our meals arrived surprisingly quickly indicating either a microwave or that we were given the same order as the couple next to us or both My steak and kidney was excessively hot with burnt pastry indicating microwave My wife s medallions of fillet had a superb sauce but the provenance of fillet was doubtful her creme brule was hot on the top and cold on the bottom  This was disappointing as the staff were pleasant and tried very hard The ambience is excellent and the availability of well kept Robinsons was appreciated I was disposed to be delighted but was disappointed 
neutral, Nothing too special I just didn t taste the authenticity of the curries  good for budget and lots of choices 
neutral, I don t really know where to start with this place I ve been in before for a light bite with family and it food was OK but came here on Friday evening and the food was pretty terrible if I m honest  I had the antipasti for a starter which was decent however one slice of Parma ham two slices salami and 3 small slices of chorizo was a little bit tight for the price It was also served with what seemed to be focaccia bread Oliver oil and balsamic dip & a few olives but it just wasn t eye catching at all I love Italian food and this just left something to be desired  Moving on to the real disaster   I ordered the T-bone steak off of the specials menu which also came with a pepper corn sauce It looked good but upon cutting into the steak I instantly knew it wasn t going to taste great The steak wasn t seasoned prior to cooking & was virtually well done just a tiny hint of pink I then found we had no pepper grinder on our table so we had to take one off an empty table The biggest let down was the pepper corn sauce The sauce it self looked ok but was almost white and I dipped a small slice of steak into it and found it to taste like nothing other than double cream with a few black peppercorns added I make peppercorn sauce at home a lot and this is not how a peppercorn sauce should be I am lucky that I didn t pour it on my meal as it would of been totally inedible  The service was good apart from two check backs within two minutes by two difference people and the setting was nice I will visit again but not sure if I ll be ordering or just coming for a drink  On a lighter note my partner did seem to have no issues and really enjoyed her food  Good effort on presentation but lacking where it counts 
neutral, Was taken here for a meeting recently and enjoyed a perfectly pleasant brunch in a simple down to earth little cafe Friendly staff a happy ambience a fairly decent coffee efficient service - I could have no complaints at all especially not after the chocolate cake I greedily took away with me The interior treads a fairly well worn path that has been rolled out countless times and the menu was a bit small but then how many choices does a man need All very pleasant and simple but effective 
neutral, Great food limited atmosphere below average staff not very friendly or attentive But food was very good and ok value for money Nice reburb 
neutral, Popped into this establishment to grab a quick bite to eat as it looked bright and welcoming from the outside with its large windows and colourful decor They have invested in good quality signage etc in an area of a town which is decidedly scruffy Ordered a very straightforward open tuna & spring onion sandwich at 4 95 and was disappointed that it came as an unremarkable single slice of brown bread with a relatively small portion of filling but an adequate separate serving of coleslaw which to be fair was fresh and ok  Either the price point for this sandwich or the portion size is completely wrong It baffles me why a sandwich lounge in this of all locations would skimp on portion size when there is little or no occasional passing trade Whilst the furniture inside is an interesting mix of retro & shabby-chic they appear to have chosen some chairs which are completely impractical for sitting on to eat  Not something I would repeat as a matter of course when I could have had a larger better sandwich for 3 less in the local bakery 
neutral, One of the most expensive burgers in the area Not that good Not that bad but nothing special  We were in a party of 12 and everyone was a bit disappointed with the food  The problem is that there is so much great options round here for this type of food  The best thing was the service though Really good  So I wont be back and would probably recommend other places if you know the area 
neutral,  The Lowndes Arms   of Whaddon in rural Buckinghamshire is a typical earthy rustic 16th century pub Rising up from a narrow village high street it gives miles of great views overlooking the surrounding rolling countryside Having passed  the arms   several times on our often scenic journey from Milton Keynes to Wendover we decided to stop for Sunday roast The recommendations we had received from a friend were well founded The roast was very good and plentiful The menu choices for a Sunday were more varied than most The host was welcoming and attentive and the service prompt The only negative was the frontage which gives the impression of dowdiness due to its age However we were glad we stopped and we will be stopping again   
neutral, Went to a wedding the buffet was good for the budget but the chicken drumsticks werent cooked properly and the toilets decor was old toilets were cooked till temp cooked until 
neutral, As one of my earlier reviews will attest I am big fan of the Edinburgh restaurant of this chain This one unfortunately was not as good In clich€÷d footballing terms it was a meal of two halves  When we arrived we were informed that there had been a power cut in the kitchen and they were working on getting it fixed We were fine with this and happily retreated to the bar for cocktails whilst the electricians did their thing  After about 20 minutes we were moved to the dining room and our lovely waitress explained that the power was back on but a couple of the dishes would not be available Again this was not a problem We ordered the meat plank for three a selection of artisan bread and then all of us ordered pasta dishes for our mains  The antipasti plank was perfect The bread and oil was delicious Then as the plates were cleared away we were informed that we now had a new waiter He meant well but he would not leave us alone Whilst I acknowledge that it is better than being ignored this level of over attentiveness was interrupting our conversations and it became quite annoying  The pasta dishes were bland and watery which was extremely disappointing We were given a free sorbet for dessert a gold membership perk but this didn t really make up for pasta  I ll still go back to the Edinburgh restaurant but I ll probably give this one a miss in the future 
neutral, if you in the area the bar is a nice spot for a drink The restaurant menu frankly tries too hard to cover too many bases  so you can have Japanese sashimi Thai satay Spanish ham cigarettes  just for starters Lobster mac n cheese as ok  but I d say keep it simple  The grilled rib eye steak was good 
neutral, This is good value food and very much a diner and not a restaurant It has a lovely selection of desserts on show made fresh onsite 
neutral, Have visited several times before and enjoyed the location and ambience of this restaurant This time disappointed by new menu and especially the beef and ale pie which was mushy with a filling more like soup which had soaked into the pastry Other quests meals were much more acceptable Very helpful and informative staff but food took at least 45minutes to arrive from order being placed 
neutral, On first impression it is a newly built pub very well set out and comfortable  The staff in general can not do enough for you That is the good bit Lets get this straight it is a cheep pub trying to compete with Weatherspoons and it has not quite done it We have been there several times with mixed results reading other reviews I would agree serving the food really hot seems to be the main problem  So my tip would be do not go when it is really busy and it should be O K 
neutral, Went with a group of friends at the end of July  cocktails and beers were spot on but we were all a bit underwhelmed by the food  The burgers which we d gone for lacked seasoning and were pretty tasteless as was the fish kebab very watery when you bit into it  The starters ribs were v good though  I ll definitely give it another go as looking at the other reviews it seems we might have hit in on an off night 
neutral,Popped into here for a drink earlier today -- nice enough place and good company Staff were friendly and chatty but I did find out those unfortunate enough to be working on Christmas Day won t be getting anything to eat unless they pay full price for it -- Christmas Menu only on Christmas Day makes sense but you re telling me they can t even provide a free meal for their staff working on Christmas Day Please bear this in mind for next year s booking while you re enjoying your Christmas meal at the Longboat obviously run by Mr & Mrs Scrooge Longface not Longboat Nice selection of lagers btw 
neutral, We only ate here once The owner or manager was sweeping up outside and just kept going throughout our meal The food was ok tasty enough but you could make any of it yourself with a trip to the supermarket the sweeping generated dust which of course didnt make for a fantastic atmosphere Certainly not the worst place to eat in Polperro but I guess you have to pick your moment to eat around their chores not the other way round as you d assume 
neutral, All started well the waiting staff attentive and the starters were good and generous in size  As the meal progressed both the quality of the food and the service seemed to drop away Guinea hen was fine but the potato puree too sticky and stodgy for me Took a while to get the dessert & tea coffee ordered The chocolate mousse seemed to be quantity over quality which didn t seem to be the French way  but despite its size it was still consumed before the hot drinks arrived Somewhat cheeky to automatically add 12 5 service onto the bill which I didn t challenge only due to the circumstances of the evening it was my birthday - but not quite the treat hoped for  
neutral, We visited the restaurant in the early evening and found it absolutely heaving It seems to be a popular spot and the reviews here confirm this The decoration was fresh and contemporary with a relaxed atmosphere all round  Some people have pointed out its unusual location the building used to be a pub of some description and given the proximity to the motorway and the relatively few Thai restaurants in the area then it scores highly in this respect  Our food was served quickly though the staff managed to mix our order up nevertheless they resolved this without fuss The dishes were well sized and quite tasty but nothing that I haven t sampled before and certainly not good enough to justify a price of 14 for a sharing starter and 13 for a Salmon dish especially when rice and noodles were extra  I was also a little miffed to find a very average glass of white wine was nearly 6 Im no snob but neither have I forgotten the concept of value for money  Ultimately a bill of 52 for two people soured what was otherwise an enjoyable experience Perhaps that s me being old fashioned   
neutral, We like to go here normally to view the football The bar staff are very friendly and are quick to serve Prices are average Crowd can be a little bit off putting but overall I would go back 
neutral, Stopped in here for a quick glass of wine - the decor was nicely done the staff were lovely the wine was very reasonably priced  10 50 for 2 large Gavi s however the place smelled vile It smelled of a combination of grease stale beer and smoke Even after we left we still smelled it for the rest of the evening - what a shame as everything else was so good 
neutral, Had a meal there with friends in mid-September 2014 just not terribly impressed with this restaurant as the food was fairly bland but it was still quite pricey 
neutral, Wasn t as good as I d heard Pizza was very similar to a pancake Staff were very nice though I would go again to see if it is any different 
neutral,Being a Wetherspoon s pub it will always be popular but with the Tower of London close by there is a constant flow of customers 
neutral, In November we used a Groupon to go to Beachview Greek restauarant a very short amble from this place if we hadn t done that then maybe I would give 4 dots to Steki s however being so close and so similar one has to draw comparisons and Steki s comes up short   Again we used a Groupon and at Groupon prices it is very good indeed however there is no way I would eat here at standard prices The king prawn starter in tomato sauce was very good and the meatballs kef something that I had were fine Mousakka was good but little aubergine or meat mostly bechemel and only 3 potatoes 5 on online photo and the Lamb Giouvetsi although tasty was a small portion especially compared to the photo online I may sound a bit picky but it all looked a bit meagre I have only just looked at the photos so I wasn t going there with expectations if I had seen the photos first and paid full price I would have been even more aggrieved  Service was friendly and relatively swift especially given that it was only one waitress to quite a few diners Drinks are a fair price  Don t get me wrong this place is better than ok but walk a few more metres to the bottom of Preston Street and you can get a seaview slightly bigger portions and slightly lower prices  
neutral, very smart decor and overall nice interior but is a karaoke pub and very noisy relatively cheap and cheerful 
neutral,The newly refurbished Red Lion has had a new lease of life and was looking like a quintessentially English village pub on a chilly Saturday night a week before Christmas The quality of the make over has transformed a nice village pub into a quality new eatery just outside the county town  Good real ale and nicely prepared gin and tonic in balloon glasses Good selection of contemporary dishes on the menu Overall the food was good but not excellent - no sauce with the pheasant and a cold waffle showed lack of attention to detail which ultimately let down what could have been an excellent evening I hope the owners get this sorted quickly so that other clientele don t feel slightly disappointed too 
neutral,Popped in for a Ham Egg and Chips and a pint Well worth it had Cameron s Strongarm bitter on in Devon made my day Good value decent pub grub nice ham loads of chips will certainly go again Good beer good food clean toilets 
neutral,I agree with the reviewer below and am not sure why this pace would get five stars The food was mediocre at best bland at worst What s more it s quite pricy 
neutral, Went there last minute on a Saturday night with my boyfriend - I had the 2 course set menu which was good value about 13 for bruschetta & steak with was well cooked  My boyfriend however had the seafood risotto - AVOID at all costs Looked smelt & tasted like uncle Ben s rice - rice was hard & not cooked & so liquid to hold it together When we said we weren t going to pay for it the waitress grabbed the bowl off the table & marched off before banging around in the kitchen Worst risotto ever seen  Would not go back 
neutral, The food is at best cheap and cheerful boarders get ping and ding staff are helpful and friendly decor and fittings are seriously in need of a refit the locals if that what they are travellers are a rowdy bunch and it was virtually empty at 8 30 at night so their noise was amplified through pub If you only want s quick drop in when your busy meal then this place will do 
neutral,If you like a subway then you get what you expect nothing more nothing less customer service isnt the best when Ive been served  But not been in a few months so might have changed least friendly place ive been to for sandwiches I now go to other shops that are more cheery and welcoming for my sandwiches and coffee 
neutral, Met up with friends for a meal at 6 25pm on a Tuesday night Warm welcome and shown to our table and told we could choose the daytime menu or the evening menu Our server was Sydonne what a loverly bubbly helpful lady and full credit to her We chose the daytime menu and starters then fish n chips as this was a bit cheaper Starters were fine but the fish was a bit grey and batter a bit soggy chips were great Saw some fish portions going out to people who had arrived later bigger size and looked better so guess that would be the evening menu So next time I would choose the dearer menu still great value and you get what you pay for 
neutral, We had dinner with friends I had queen scallops to start which were over-cooked and served in a scallop shell on a plank of wood then had a burger as a main course which cam on a plank of wood with fries in a small bucket The burger was OK but the side salad I ordered never appeared I didn t dare have a dessert because of the risk of deforestation The sooner this fad for serving food on odd bits of wood dies out the better  I tried three of the beers with a sip of a fourth and I only liked one a special rather than one of the regular brews The rest seemed tired and lacking any depth of flavour 
neutral, Had read very good reviews about this place and so was a bit disappointed by my visit  On arriving I noticed a couple eating some enormous looking burgers which made my mind up for me Closer inspection showed they were both eating their burgers with a knife and fork I decided to give the restaurant and not the couple the benefit of the doubt  Mistake Two bites in and the bun exploded This was a shame as the filling and chips were good but I wanted a hand held treat not a pile of mush on a breadboard  Mentioned the issue to the waiter but was pretty much fobbed off and I am fairly sure my criticism will not be passed to where it needs to get to Shame 
neutral, If you love gardening and have lots of excess cash to waste this is the ideal place to go Very expensive in every area Nice place to look around though OK for a day out if you have young children But an OK experience 
neutral,OK so there s nothing much decent around SE11 for breakfast brunch afternoon tea & cakes so this certain finds the market and explains its ever busy existence Tucked away in a quiet corner a stones throw from bustling Vauxhall Coffee shop by day with a cool modern mismatch of furniture and design If you re lucky get sofa & enjoy the boardgames or books to pass the afternoon by    however getting any seat is often a game of luck itself Definitely not for the coffee addict but a huge selection of delicious teas served in teapots and quirky china Cakes look delicious  This is a favourite brunch spot however since I ve been coming here the quality of food is slipping portion sizes small yet pricey once prime butcher-quality bacon & sausages now cheap and deep fried  The service is undoubtably this place s let down - inattentive unreliable and slow  In summary a once South meets East London gem that s loosing its shine 
neutral,Good standard chippy and i ve tried a few Shuts a bit early for me but its a good place and does all the normal stuff with no fuss 
neutral, I must admit to agreeing to some of the less than complimentary comments from other reviewers We did have to wait for a while but that s not a problem as it was clear they were busy The salad bar is always good but you can t muck up salad the meals are ok but nothing special They knew it was a family birthday bash but other than lighting a cake that we had bought with us they did nothing to make it special We have been there other times but at best the meals are mediocre other chain restaurants provide better quality value food 
neutral, Dined here early Saturday evening fixed price menu  Food good service and ambience absurdly unrelaxed more like sitting in an understaffed emergency ward than a relaxed eaterie 
neutral, Sorry to say Michelangelo in Prudhoe has closed its doors Food and service was ok but was not doing enough business to keep it going To much comptition 
neutral, The decor certainly is appealing and the drinks are nice enough although my hot chocolate - or should I say cocoa-flavoured milk - was positively underwhelming But we couldn t get rid of the impression that the prices and overall attitude of the staff were far ahead of the quality of service delivered For example we overheard a rather unpleasant conversation where the customer complained about being charged extra for having requested additional bread because she wasn t given enough to be able to enjoy the spread that she had ordered Also when my brother went to the bathrooms he came back somewhat shocked and told us that a member of the kitchen staff did not wash his hands after having used the toilet A strange thing to have to mention in a review but for us certainly one of the important details that Macchiavelli seems to not be concerned about too much Shame 
neutral, The problem I found with manna and most other vegetarian restaurants is that the dishes are all OK but would be much nicer if they had a bit of meat in them The food at manna is expensive and I can t say the flavour or imagination justifies it My main course was pasta a few slices of courgette and cherry tomatoes covered in cream  12 And that was the cheapest main Starters were 8 The setting was nice and the staff pleasant but I just don t think the price justified a pretty average meal 
neutral, really nice food - if a bit on the pricey side 
neutral, The price is ok  9 for basic burger and fries but the place is full of desperate hipsters They give you a roll of kitchen roll instead of napkins they don t have normal fries only sweet potato and they don t have normal condiments only fancy sauces All of which would be fine if it was blow your socks off amazing food But it was just food  I ve eaten at The Diner in soho which has a similar serving style but the food is much better and the vibe of the place is much nicer Boozy milkshakes weren t on All in all the most pretentious badly lit place I have ever eaten 
neutral, I have being going there many times as take away with company discount and fidelity card the prices are good and the food is light and enjoyable When you sit down the prices go up no loyalty card and no company discount and a cheap decent meal become expensive and the service is far to be great Take away or go somewhere else 
neutral, This restaurant was recommended to me Big double size restaurant Outside space in front nice but buy a Bus Stop on the Main Road [NOISY] Food ok Staff good OK 
neutral, Gets very busy during the summer months and you must expect to wait up to 30 minutes for a table if you arrive between 6and 7 30 pm Menu is varied and the best for me is the unlimited salad bar don t bother with a starter as this is combined with all main courses 
neutral, Revisited this place as it is a great place to meet friends and family  Now the colder weather s creeping in its big windows create a cold effect in the place and some additional heating would much improve the cosiness and overall enjoyment of everyone s visit No gripes about the food or service however  always great 
neutral, I was part of a party of 15 to take Sunday lunch yesterday at the Kings Head about 12 30  The food was good but the poor waitress was completely overwhelmed There were 3 under 5s in our party and the meal took 2 hours for 2 courses in which time I took my toddler for several walks around the pub a trip to the garden and a stroll to the village shops  I had the roast beef which was cooked very well The potatoes were little hard but the other vegetables were just right The gravy was very tasty Unfortunately someone completely forgot my sister in law s main course  For desert I had the Sherry trifle which was delicious and a pleasingly large portion  All in all a mixed experience I m sure it would have been a lot better if it were not for the size of our booking 
neutral, Nice tasting coffee overshadowed by the wait three people in front of me in the que and waited almost 10 minutes Didn t seem to be any sense of urgency about the staff would maybe go back if I saw through the window that there was no que 
neutral, The last time I was here with with office folks the cheque was picked up by my boss This time I was here for some dessert and whiskey post dinner The Choc fudge pudding was just wonderful but the remaining items on the menu were not that appealing The Whiskey was over priced and the service charges were really high too Overall i would say go here only if you want to impress someone There was even a cover charge of 9 pounds on a Thursday night   
neutral, We often drop in here before or after the local football match It isn t the most atmospheric of restaurants and the serving can be a bit chaotic especially when they are at full capacity as often happens before the evening matches last time we walked out as it was taking ages to get our order taken so we gave up & went down the road to another restaurant  There is a good selection on the menu-lots of various Asian food including crispy duck through to sushi which I ve never tried there  The spring roll starter size is generous & tasty I also often get the salt & pepper tofu which is usually very tasty but the time before last the last time we ate there was disappointing with little flavour again the place was full before a match so there was high demand on the kitchen  So a mixed review - worth a go but avoid match nights if possible 
neutral, Ideal for food with atmosphere with friends however the food does not match the surroundings - could & should be hotter Had worse but don t expect gourmet food Can recommend the pulled pork sandwich though as the taste is divine - just needs to be served HOTTER 
neutral, Nice welcome and friendly staff managed to fit us in without a reservation food was ok the dough balls and side salad were good but the pizza was average with a hard base 
neutral, We were recommended this restaurant which sits right at the start of the pier We were told they sold the best fish and chips in town Sadly the local knowledge was faulty I wish I d checked with TripAdvisor first  The fish was OK although a bit expensive Like other reviewers I agree the chips were poor It seems those running this restaurant either never read their reviews or just can t be bothered to improve Sadly I expect they get so much casual trade they don t need to try that hard  It was a nice day so we were able to sit outside and enjoy the view which was the best part of the experience However I won t be back and suggest you give it a miss There must be better places in Southwold 
neutral, We were on a boating holiday and decided to walk the 20 minutes or so from the boat to the pub after reading several reviews on Trip Advisor In summary the food was OK without being brilliant but did not have the same taste and satisfaction that other similar Broad Pubs offered You expect better for the price paid so we feel unanimous decision for party of 4 we did not receive value for money on this occasion A bit disappointing considering the long walk from the Broads Have had much better at less cost on the same holiday 
neutral, 24 hour service disliked the rain obviously outside  
neutral, The food was good although they forgot one of our 8 strong groups meal so she had to wait Then when we revived bill there was a compulsory service charge of nearly 15 00 I wonder who really gains from the sevice charge and should be discretionary 
neutral, The food here is excellent but the staff could have had the odd smile or two Maybe they were having an off day when we visited 
neutral,Family visit Had a garlic tiger prawn starter which was excellent - but no bread served with it to soak up sauce and no finger bowl considering that it s messy to eat as prawns are partially in shells Adults ordered Lasagne whilst kids had pizza The lasagne had a very tasty sauce but was lacking meat Pizzas were excellent Kids loved the sticky toffee pudding   Tiramisu lacked taste and consistency other than creamy - certainly didn t taste of coffee or any alcohol Ordered a black coffee which was served far too hot and was weak Service was quick but place lacks atmosphere 
neutral,Went for the lunch buffet at May Sum in Derby A very large room with high ceiling didn t immediately help the atmosphere particularly as it was only 10 full that day I have been told they employed a Feng Shui to decorate the place I d say get a second opinion May be better when they are more people at night And why was it so dimly lit inside Not a huge choice for lunch as reflected in the cheaper price compared to the 11 50 - 12 90 evening ticket - they do a whole Teppanyaki range later All the normal Chinese buffet favorites were to be had plus a couple of Thai ones A large mix of mostly deep fried starters though with a few kiddies snacks thrown in pizza cocktail sausage hash brown etc  The tempura veg was very nice though I went back for more of that Nice  A lot of the trays were half empty while I was there but did get to try virtually everything The Chinese curry was nice and spicy with a good consistency There were a couple of very tasty lamb dishes plus a blow your head off chilli dish The meals were marked spicy or mild so you knew what you were getting The Squid dish was lacking as was the sweet and sour Overall the quality of all the meat lamb chicken beef pork was tender and juicy Quite well cooked  I liked the range of sweets puddings in the traditional tiny portions Cakes fruit jelly But I normally go for ice cream Only one flavour I could find You add your own topping sauce  Service polite and speedy  A very reasonable 6 90 for food but with an expensive pint of Carling this went over 10 I ve given this 3 5 for lack of a good range of dishes couldn t see crispy seaweed or duck and no sushi but it all mostly tasted great and was well cooked A place to fill your belly and have a chat Don t take a book though as it will be too dark to read it 
neutral, We went to this restaurant at about 9 30pm on a Saturday night after a long day worth of driving The menu seemed appetising and the atmosphere seemed lively even though we were tired and could do with some quiet time  We had two courses for starters the calamares and the mexican poppadoms The calamares seemed old and was not fresh and the mexican poppadoms although nice could have done with some sour cream as part of the dips The mains we had were the burrito and the churassco fiasca which is essentially a kebab with salad and casava chips The churassco was lovely finely cooked with some taste and the casava chips if you like that kind of thing was cooked through which is hard to do The burrito on the other hand was tasteless The chicken had very little flavour and the rice was really really bland  We did complain and the manager did come over and apologise there was no discount given either considering this was our first time to Las Iguanas  The fact the manager came over to apologise and explain a reason why the food was bad is a compliment to him The service we received was very good attentive and friendly I can not fault that at all  The atmosphere although lively probably wasn t what we needed that day The venue is a city centre location so if you are looking for a quiet meal and a drink this isn t the place If you are looking to move on out after a meal then this would be a good place to eat  Overall we were not impressed by the food which is what makes us go back to places Apparently we may get some discount tokens in the post if so we may give it another go otherwise probably not 
neutral, The food was good I had Chateaubriand however - this is large amounts of beef steak cooked medium rare - it gave me upset stomach and led to intense stomach evacuation Not pleasant 
neutral, Having had high recommendations we were somewhat disappointed 6 of us went for dinner including two Japanese guests Starters were fine Rib eye steak which was ordered med rare came up almost raw on one half and overcooked on the other half Two ordered pistachio cr€—me brulee which came up served in three half chicken shells on straw Did not taste of any pistachio and the accompanying shortbread was coated in caramel chocolate which was so sickly Not anything like any cr€—me brulee I have ever seen before and hopefully won t meet again  Service was a little slow as well Would not return 
neutral,Nice food but very pricey though for what it is - unless you have a Merlin Pass which brings it a bit closer to normality Had some colouring bits to entertain the little ones which was helpful Staff seemed nice 
neutral,Booked afternoon tea the service was very slow had to wait a long time for menus and to be served plus ordered champagne and waited nearly 45min and we had nearly finished our tea before it arrived Food was good and the view was amazing because of the slow service I only rate this 3 star it spolit the day slightly they need more staff to cater the size of the restaurant please note the 12 5 that they add to your bill including drinks 
neutral, I went here with a couple of friends for tapas and the place looks lovely It was 7 45pm and there were only around 10 customers in the whole place and some of them were only drinking so we went to order food but for some bizarre reason they said it would be a 90 minute wait so we left 
neutral, Visited The Venue over the Christmas period as we did a number of restaurants and in fairness I must say these were not the worst for the meal was fine but the service was poor The restaurant was half empty but the girl taking our order was lets say less than enthusiastic and although we did not have to wait long for our main meal it took ages to be served again with our dessert and then when it did arrive it was wrong We said nothing to avoid another long wait 
neutral,I like this place in summer as you can sit outside in the covered area behind the pub and we have come here a number of times over the years Recent Sunday lunch roast was poor value though It came with two tiny roast potatoes with no crispness and a reheated taste Clearly they had run out Meat was OK but laid over a big dollop of mash which formed about a third of the entire dish Slow and odd service The waiter seemed annoyed that I asked him to wipe the sticky table when we arrived Lots of small children running about My wife had the fish which she said was nice So a mixed experience Quite a limited menu Will think twice before going back 
neutral, They managed to find & book a table for 10 even after their allocation for bookings as already full - great service We arrived on time and were shown our table Then we had to join the bun fight at the bar to place our order We had to do this for everything we wished to order apart from desserts and coffee Not the most pleasant of experiences  Than we had to pay - had time for another drink at the bar while they manually typed the orders from the hand written tabs into the till The till roll did not have any itemised details other than the words drink & food  How were we supposed to check the details for a party of 10 Not a good experience and Trading Standards should look at that practice  However the food was good and the venue is very pleasant just not sure I want to repeat the visit 
neutral,I ve eaten here 3 times most recently with 3 friends after a trip to the Chelsea Flower Show  We arrived slightly early on a Thursday evening and was told of a nice pub around the corner as our table wasn t ready  On arriving back we was seated and given menus We ordered a starter main each plus a bottle Sancere  We received an amous bouche shortly after but had to chase bread and this was served with the starters  On the waitress pouring the wine my friend asked whether the wine was vegetarian as many aren t and was told she wasn t sure She also said that there was a separate vegetarian wine list however that particular bottle she was unsure about - that surprised us as its a vegetarian restaurant If wine wasn t was the cheese I think I got the best starter and main but that s because I d dined there previously and knew what I was orderering The menu is hard to understand  The jump from 28 for 2 courses to 38 to add a 3rd course we felt was too high and we decided not to have a dessert My friends ordered another bottle of wine and the bill came to 211 for 4 people 2 courses each and 2 bottles of wine Which is on the higher end  In contrast me and my other half ate at the Gate restaurant in Angel the following lunch and had a great meal no booze for 28 including the 20 discount for national vegetarian week  All in all this was my 3rd visit but I wouldn t rush back plenty of other great options out there 
neutral,The food is good but rather pricey It is very noisy if the place is more than half full They sell some interesting beer 
neutral,Its a fish and chip shop so you get what it says on the tin  Good quality battered fish and chips I ate in and had the combo which was one hell of a plate full and was pretty damn good 
neutral, Been a few times service really does depend on time of day and how busy they are I ve been early on and service was quick with drinks and average for food I ve also been when it s busy and service for drinks was slow and food was even slower 
neutral, The fish was nicely fried light batter and not greasy The chips were good and the mushy peas properly cooked The staff though let the place down impatient and bordering on rude Shame really because it s in a great location 
neutral, Queuing when we arrived we expected that  We queued for 20 minutes but whilst we were queuing there were numerous tables empty they just need clearing and cleaning - a 2 minute job All who were in the queue could have been seated within 5 minutes at the most Very frustrating Some people walked away because of the queue They should have told us the reason for the delay it subsequently turned out that they were short staffed  If they want people to queue why don t they give people a menu then when they are seated people are ready to order We were shown to our table and were immediately asked what we wanted - we hadn t even looked at the menu Very poor service 
neutral, I have been in Robert ransomes off and on for the last three monthes the ladies toilets are in a terrible state locks broken lights out toilets seats dirty could do with a good make over 
neutral, You get what you pay for  weatherspoons are pretty much the same Nice to have a local one but the food is basic Decor is nice and fits in with the theme Nice guest beers 
neutral, Knowing that this pub restaurant is owned by the group headed by Nigel Haworth and had featured in the Michelin guide to pub dining we were keen to book it for a Saturday lunch for my wife s mother The place was very busy but we were attended to promptly and seated at our table but then we had to wait a little while for the waitress The starters were quite good when compared to standard pub fayre but perhaps not as classy as other supposedly foody pubs However they were tasty and came in generous portions We decided on traditional style food for our mains my wife having fish and chips and my mother in law and I having the cheese and onion pie Whilst my wife s meal was perfectly reasonable the same as you would get in any other pub the pies were extremely poor The pastry was overcooked and almost burnt and we had to search for the contents What there was of the cheese and onion was a light smearing adhered to the inside of the pastry and then there was a great empty void It appeared to have evaporated perhaps due to it being left in the oven for a long period We raised it with the waitress who told us that they are usually better I suppose we could have caused more of a fuss but my wife and I didn t want to spoil her mother s treat who in fairness enjoyed the occasion not for the food but for the trip out In summary I would say the pub is located in a nice setting has a modern style and good ambience The prices are very reasonable However whilst most of the food is satisfactory it is not exceptional In the case of pie making it s pretty bad It s a pub we can tick off our list and we won t be back 
neutral, We were looking for a B& B but all full We decided to stay for dinner meal was not outstanding usual  Pub Grub  Chips with everything  There seemed to be a problem with card system unable to use our debit card paid cash  Found a bed elsewhere called next morning for Breakfast Food was nothing to shout about Toast was just dried white bread  BUT Asked for pot of tea for two There arrived a glass coffee jug with tea in it Two thick broad coffee cups completely useless for tea The tea was tasteless I went out to the car and took a couple of teabags from our emergency stock and asked the staff too use these  I was informed they DON T have Teapots   Nor tea cups  Where do these people think we are San Francisco  It doesn t cost the earth to provide proper Tea Pots and Tea Cups for the standard British breakfast beverage I have been in Chicago in the U S A and been served Liptons tea in Staffordshire Tea pots and china cups  Meal finished Again paid cash  We will DEFINITELY give all Marstons Establishments a clear miss in our future trips We found a nice caf€÷ in Ludlow which served proper tea in the traditional crockery Nice china cups Proper tea pot What a difference Nice golden toast and marmalade 
neutral, Food was reasonably good but expensive Wine was expensive and average quality There was no passion or excitement in what they are doing Personally I thought the place lackedatmospere 
neutral, A last minute decision to book a table in Soho prior to a theatre trip Decision made on the basis of Turkish Moroccan Lebanese style food and this hit the spot We had a set Mezze for 17 each which was exactly as you d expect Nothing unusual or exceptional Swiftly delivered at 6pm it wasn t exactly busy though and just what we needed But because there is so much choice around I doubt we ll go back Nothing at all wrong but definitely nothing special 
neutral, The food was pretty decent and arrived in good time  The lack of choice on the beer front needs looking at why not get a hand pull on like they have at the olive branch The addition of a disco ball cheapens the establishment and in my opinion definitely does nothing to create an atmosphere  
neutral, Firstly I would like to say what a pleasant place this is and a very good local asset I am however a regular visitor with my grandson and have to say the service is terrible They never have a full selection of ice cream as is advertised on the board and despite visiting regularly on a Monday morning which is hardly a busy time service is still very slow As an example I ordered a pot of tea and unbelievably had to wait 15 minutes for it to be served The week prior I ordered a coffee to drink in and after waiting 10 minutes I was served with coffee to take out in a cardboard type cup I understand all food is cooked from scratch and under those circumstances it is obvious that you would have to wait the required time   but come on surely tea  coffee can be served a little quicker Another point   very often when food is ordered the waitress waiter spend time wandering around inside and outside with a tray of food trying to find out who has ordered it despite giving you a number card when you order I am sure all local people want this business to succeed and to be fair in the main they do a good job staff are polite however there never seems to be anyone in overall charge 
neutral, Well located to meet up with people It is however just a place serving coffee and in that respect it is fine It didn t make me feel sophisticated or cosmopolitan It mainly made me think I could of had a proper drink for that price 
neutral, We had been meaning to visit the Hand & Flower since seeing the Chef Tom on Great British Menu  We finally made it there yesterday a beautiful sunny day Our booking was at Midday we weren t greeted straight away & when we were we were taken to our table - we were sat on a booth that arched around meaning to begin with we had to sit next to each other rather than opposite & also that me feet were dangling unable to reach the floor I m 5ft2 so not too tiny  As we were one of the first customers we asked if it would be possible to move to another table with chairs - at first we were ignored & then the second time we asked we were told  no we re fully booked & all the tables are the same height anyway we expressed that it wasn t the table height that was the problem it was the chair height she was very huffy & went off too see if she could find a chair   she had an awful attitude   I can t understand why a Michelin star restaurant would employ a person with such little patience The food was great but our experience was already ruined We won t be going back such a shame 
neutral, Great view thought the food was good maybe a bit bland and fairly priced Staff were friendly 
neutral, It s a lovely location with an amazing view in a prime part of Whitstable however this restaurant is only average to good compared with the premium pricing  I found the staff here very good and attentive The food was reasonable - some dishes better than others Fish appeared fresh However  - Bread was not fresh and appeared to be a sliced baguette you d buy in a supermarket - Paper napkins - Paper tablecloth so cheap - Premium pricing  If you want to charge a lot you have to follow through with the experience I didn t feel it here which is a shame as it has so much potential and probably with little effort Until then I ll go elsewhere in Whitstable 
neutral,I ve been to this restaurant several times and their food choice from the menu is usually pretty tasty stuff i have to say though that yesterday i got food poisoned with their muscles in kung po sauce important in bed with 38temperature and stomachache thank u 
neutral, Under the railway tracks in a tunnel close by Vauxhall Station this is a favourite with locals The atmosphere is busy and the service can be hit or miss The food is good but not exciting  
neutral, Not been to Elmas for a few years hubby fancied a change so went here I remembered a Elmas used to be very swish stylish and a pleasurable experience Sorry guys what s gone wrong Food was ok hubby had a starter which was best out of the meal he had chicken livers the rest of the meal was ok but the fillet steak pasta was not fillet steak sorry to be picky The main guy is as always charming but have to say the rest of the staff seem to lack the old finesse It s too loud it s too rushed and it s not as classy as it used to be to the point of grubby and untidy Sad to say we won t be rushing back 
neutral, Came here as was recommended & Have been told only good things but I was disappointed when me & my partner ordered the soup of the day which was carrot & coriander it was so spicy i like spicy food so it wasn t a problem for me but my partner could not finish hers they should have called it spiced carrot & coriander  hold back on the pepper chef We ordered mains which were much nicer but my salmon dish was very bland which I found strange as it seemed the chef went from using loads of seasoning to none Any way my partner had mushroom risotto which was really nice for less than 20 two courses & a drink each you can t really grumble 
neutral, We often get take away from here The food has always been great good quality and real value for money Was saddened to see it got zero in Jan 2014 from food standards agency 
neutral, Proper pub for proper drinkers A little rough and ready inside but quirky Staff are friendly though and always serve with a smile Food is good 
neutral, We visited here a couple of months ago after not being here since around April 2013 Last time we reviewed the place quite highly and only commented on a couple of minor things  Unfortunately this visit we were a little less satisfied The portion sizes are now more reasonable and not too large as we felt they were in the past The service is now at the table which is also a positive move  Prices are much the same and there are also lots on the specials board as usual  The overall feel of the place has lost some of it s charm and feels a little more bland cafe than nice country pub now especially where we sat up the stairs  My wife s food was fine and we had no real issues I ordered the Tuna steak and asked the waiter how this would be cooked Fresh Tuna is always best cooked medium rare otherwise the taste becomes more fishy and a little unpleasant The waiter told me that the Tuna is normally served pink which is fine and to be expected  My order came and unfortunately the tuna was overcooked and well done all the way through It was fishy and bland and was not what I was looking forward to Don t get me wrong it was not very bad just not as it should be and more like something you would get from a bought in chain  The fact that it was well cooked may have been a blessing as unfortunately I was a little ill after this meal which is very rare for me having a pretty much cast iron stomach  and I m thinking that if the tuna was cooked rare I could have been more ill  So not a great visit and on this strength unfortunately we won t be back in a hurry 
neutral, Visited the foxglove this evening the service was excellent the food was good apart from the chips which we were all disappointed with they were like macdonalds fries in size we re not hot enough and I would have been embarrassed to serve them 
neutral, Found this little place in the middle of the folk festival  Very nice food and atmosphere was good Not too keen on their dog policy as there were dogs strewn over the floor Some good some bad dogs  Now the staff were friendly enough but some lacked the customer service that you would expect Not keen on the uniform dress of them Maybe it was the warm weather but you still need to dress for work not a night out The bathroom needs sorting  especially having the hot water tank right in front of you 
neutral, I liked this place It had a rustic type of atmosphere The beer was good The food I ate there was fine and simple Reasonably priced I thought the service was mediocre both behind the bar and from the waitresses who brought the food to the table 
neutral, Normally go to the Artichoke where I find service and food to be excellent but they were filming on the day of our visit so we popped to the coach Service as ever was amazing Food  awful Two burger meals were the buns were tough as nails Third diner had ribs and they were lovely Spent 80 for a lunch so would expect better I don t understand as it s the same company why it s not on a par with the Artichoke Lovely for a drink but won t be eating there again  
neutral, My wife and I visited for lunch today as we have done a number of times and noticed that the meals appear to be getting smaller Whilst the main part of both our meals was reasonable the side salad coleslaw and crisps that normally accompany them had all but disappeared Both side salads were made up of one slice of tomato two or three pieces of shredded lettuce two pieces of cucumber and a few strands of onion The coleslaw helping was just about the size of a single tablespoon and there were only six crisps with my wife s meal all in all very disappointing We hope that this is not the beginning of changes that will result what used to be a very good tearoom becoming mediocre 
neutral, Nice meals for 4  Not huge portions reasonably priced - best chips to die for  Good service New landlord very friendly Plenty of choice First visited a few years ago when the smoked chicken pancakes were out of this world but with a couple of landlord changes since the pancakes have disappeared from the Menu Plenty of parking 
neutral,Anywhere which points out that all food is near half price on the menu raises eyebrows in mind accompanying this the food was decidedly average though well presented  The staff all seemed a little on edge and very rushed Similarly the service was little better than average one starter never arrived and we had to ask for one of the mains twice before it arrived - having said that they did reduce the bill to accommodate for the inconvenience  As Italian restaurants go you can t argue with price but it wouldn t be my first choice 
neutral, We visited the restaurant this evening and firstly I have to say our waitress Carla from Barcelona was very attentive and pleasant a credit to the restaurant The food was also very good certainly good enough for us to consider returning to this restaurant However our experience was marred by the customer service from the front of house in the restaurant & the lead barman On arrival in the restaurant we confirmed our booking the initial & only response was need the table back for 9 o clock  no good evening pleased to meet you hope you enjoy your meal or anything Taking into account the food was good and the location fantastic we thought we should go again the following day but this time just sit in the bar and have a snack Following a patient wait for the lead barman to have time to speak to me I asked could we book a table in the bar area for 4 o clock His response was NO not I m sorry we don t take bookings just a straight NO  This customer service just gives the typical impression that individuals in these lead roles can treat customers in this manner based on the fact it s unlikely tourists will visit the same place twice based on my experience tonight they are probably correct  This is the first time I have felt the need to comment on trip advisor but this evening I left the restaurant with a bitter taste that forced me to go into print regards two individuals who I felt were downright rude and if it was my business would not be customer facing Great location & restaurant spoilt by some customer service 
neutral,Nothing special Now do not allow tabs so have to pay as you go along Service can be slow at the tills Cannot book a table and very busy up to about 8 pm I must have been 4 times now and have not been impressed with any meal although the carvery is probably the best value 
neutral, Having eaten at a number of the Loch Fyne Restaurants this is one of our favourites and certainly one of the first to be opened outside Scotland Set in a rural Northamptonshire Village these converted Farm Buildings make it an idyllic location As always fish of very good quality but I find that since the chain was sold to The Greene King Group some of that magic has been lost Downloaded a 25 Discount Voucher from their website which certainly made it good value We will return but not rush back - pity Ample car parking space 
neutral, Wonderful old building  but the welcome and hospitality have a long way to go I did not feel welcome but more of a bother to the landlord The young man helping to serve behind the bar seemed tone much more enthusiastic about customer care than the landlord 
neutral, Lots of advertising got us to try out this Inn as it said it had gone through a large refit What we saw of the inside looked very nice We were ushered into a large conservitory that was stuffy The door to the garden was open but no windows so little to no ventilation the internal finishes were poor flecks of paint all over the sides glass stains on the slate cutlery that was old stained and made you want to wipe it clean  Staff very pleasant both of us had different burgers a beef burger with Cheese and bacon and a Wagyu  The beef burger tasted more like a piece of cardboard the Wagyu burger tasted of beef and was tasty both cooked well Chips were very good but the coleslaw was a very strange pink colour and seemed to be bound in yogurt not mayo if it was mayo it was very synthetic we didn t risk it Can the Wagyu burger be a real one at 11 00 when if you buy them with no vat they average 4 50 each 
neutral, Our second visit for an evening meal our first some time ago was faultless Hence this time we went with friends  Service was on the slow side perhaps they were a little understaffed  The first course of warmed Camembert shared was excellent and we have no hesitation in recommending it  The main courses had an good range of choices the lamb and chicken chosen by the ladies received no complaints but the men who had chosen rib-eye were served meat which was tepid and appeared to have been prepared some time earlier before being served They were returned to the kitchen and came back cooked a little beyond the medium rare Mine was still only like warm and had to be returned again This time it returned hot - but the other vegetables on the plate were now cold  I gave up but to be fair although now overcooked for our liking the taste was excellent - such a pity  My usual choice of coffee is double espresso for which the barista normally heats the cup with boiling water to ensure that the small amount of coffee is hot to serve and also comes with a glass of water Not so this time our coffee was just warm - a small amount in a large cold cup  Come on Hurt Arms this is far from the standard that we remember and it s time to get your act together  The staff were all very pleasant helpful and were a credit to a restaurant which didn t deserve them 
neutral, As a resident of Wallingford we have used the OPO frequently over the years whilst the staff change they are replaced with equally friendly people the food remains good the atmosphere fine however my comment is the place needs some TLC the settees in the front of house have holes in them and the general state of repair is poor please spend some money on it   
neutral, The seating arrangement are too cramped especially near the entrance Staff were all very friendly but sauces mixed up with the meals 
neutral, Went to Saffron tonight and had a strange old evening A friend and I pitched up at around 7 30 We got possibly the worst table in the place but that was okay as it was Saturday night and we hadn t booked The restaurant has weird lighting - bright fluorescent type was playing loud dance music and screening the news   on a large TV The place was quite busy with a lot of children so lots of noise and lots going on - not a very welcoming or relaxing environment  We sent our first drinks back as they were wrong The staff though not particularly efficient were pleasant and friendly enough The starters came fairly quickly and were VERY nice indeed even though we sent the first pickle tray back as it looked like someone else s leftovers After a long gap the mains arrived which were cold and incomplete We sent these back to the kitchen to be heated up and they were brought back to the table a few minutes later - still not as hot as we would have liked but we ate them anyway when we FINALLY got out cutlery that we had to ask for - they were quite nice in spite of the fact they weren t too hot The yoghurt my friend ordered to accompany her main didn t arrive which spoiled her enjoyment of the food  We did intend to have dessert but decided against it in the end as the experience had been rather tedious and frankly hard work  I overheard a number of tables complaining I did wonder why there didn t appear to be a manager or anyone in a position of authority around to help deal with this Instead one of the waiters was left to deal with all of this In his defence he didn t do a bad job  Our bill arrived and by this point I realised that there was a manager on duty who was hiding behind the bar preparing drinks and leaving his staff to pick up the pieces of the poor service I approached the bar to ask him to remove my friend s main course she didn t eat it due to lack of yoghurt she ordered  which he kindly did  I can t say it was a terrible experience because it wasn t but I doubt I ll ever go back The food was nice but the restaurant is a bit too rowdy for my taste and there are other Indian restaurants in Leeds that offer fantastic customer service 
neutral, The restaurant looked great as did the menu so we wandered in at about 2pm Apparently the restaurant was too busy to seat us This is of course common when one hasn t booked what was surprising was the fact that the place was half empty with at least 8 empty tables So book a table before arriving 
neutral, We hand booked a table on line but when we turned up there was no record of our booking Staff were able to find us a table We had to wait an hour for our food and it was average fare scampi was over cooked and leak pie was more air than pie The staff were polite but not overly attentive We have been to others in this chain and the Windhover does not reflect well for the chain 
neutral, An interesting if somewhat quirky place The tables look quite professionally done from a view through the window A little chilly when I arrived but the fire eventually provided some warmth Tables a little too close to one another so not ideal for an intimate evening out How anyone can cook such a varied menu is quite beyond me and maybe they should try keeping to a bistro theme and not get confused between French Thai British and other places in between The beef bourginon was reasonable but the dauphinose were on an industrial school dinners scale Overall don t expect haute cuisine but it is quite passable on a cold evening Expect the unexpected and you will be ok 
neutral, Make no mistake we like the Belgian Cafe The service is good and the Belgian beer superb The food is enjoyable too but my does it need a damned good clean and a lick of paint The beer and cider is expensive which discourages drinking more than a little I think the draught cider was 2 10 for a half Please tidy the place up and sand and varnish those sticky table tops 
neutral, The one good thing about the place is the location  and the anonymity  well that s two good things 
neutral,Been many times as its local Always queue and food has always been ok Just a little dull and always too busy Can t find anywhere else better to be fair
neutral,Went last night Been a couple of times b4 so I must like it Food tries to be different from bog standard Indian and I think it succeeds Nice decor not cheap not much atmosphere but compared to the other local Indians is a cut above the rest
neutral, Food is very good but service often slow and unreliable  Several times I have been served the wrong food but to be fair it is has always been corrected 
neutral,If a restaurant is busy it usually means it is good Despite a near full house service was attentive and the food was not compromised  Brasserie Blanc is perfect for a business lunch 1 A large and varied menu meaning there will be something for all hopefully and 2 efficient service meaning you could if you so desired be in and out within the hour  While this restaurant may not set the world on fire I will undoubtedly be back again for the Onglet 8oz - Free-range Cornish hanger steak harissa butter well worth 15 quid  That said the starter I had was spectacular  the mussels and cod special  Finally I can now respond with confidence to  Know anywhere good for lunch 
neutral, +ves  Simple well cooked food Pleasant interior Friendly warm ambience -ves Lots of waiters but rarely at our table Had to go 3 times to bar to order drinks and starters Interior so dark with tiny candles to read menu Small uninspired menu and crab cakes huge disappointment soft and flabby definitely not fresh crab  Perfectly adequate restaurant but if this is 1 in Coventry heaven knows what the remainder are like   
neutral, but got seated literally facing some other lone traveller Shame he was also a man rabbiting on his mobile telephone Managed to skew a bit away from him   
neutral, It s a nice Italian restaurant with good prices which I recommend it for students  The atmosphere is really youthful atmosphere and simple but tasty italian food  
neutral, Thought I d take some clients for a nice lunch Atmosphere good food average at best and also not cheap Service was hit and miss I noticed that they take very good care of their celebrity guests at the sacrifice of us mere mortals 
neutral, I ve dined at VJ s a good number of times and overall it s not too bad  Far better as an evening bar the place is quirky and a little grungy They offer a great spot for evening drinks  The staff are always really friendly and the food is reasonably priced arriving in a timely manner The food is varied and tasty although a little bit on the budget side Good for a quick lunch but I probably wouldn t dine here on an evening  Overall not too bad Never had a bad experience here so I guess you could say this is a lukewarm review 
neutral,We visited upon a birthday celebration At first everything seemed great then we ordered and the food arrived It then came to our attention that the priority was in fact presentation not quality nor quantity It was basic to say the least The cocktails were fun but definitely not over alcoholic which when concordant to the price is unfathomable The table although a good idea was impractical for eating a Sunday meal with family and music upon levels of discomfort Then to too everything off a 25 service charge appeared on the bill Although no faults with the service it did not warrant that It was bog standard so don t expect any personal service Overall it was okay Not memorable not disastrous Will I be visiting again however The answer is most definitely no 
neutral, There now isn t much choice in Walberswick with The Bell consistently pressingly the self-destruct button but is The Anchor relying too much on having a captured market There are oodles of positives to this place the menu is locally sourced and imaginative it has a great wine list and it now has great beers both bottled and draught  The bar area is cosy and comfortable and it has great outside seating  The downsides are that it s expensive and the overall dining experience does not justify such prices On a Saturday evening we had to wait 50 minutes for our main course and the following Monday we had to wait 30 minutes even though the place was very very quiet Expect to pay around 5 for a 175ml glass of wine  good though it may be this is bordering on Michelin-starred restaurant prices  Service is OK at best  the staff work hard but don t really know the food and certainly not the wine well enough to recommend either Again not an issue when you pay 8- 10 for a main course but it is when you re paying 15+  A personal gripe is the woeful vegetarian selection I m used to only having one option in most places but a goats-cheese salad as the only choice for a Saturday-night celebratory dinner is very poor I m beginning to think they belong to the Gordon Ramsay school of thought i e vegetarians Sod  em  Overall I love this place and I only hope it doesn t get complacent The Bell can t be as bad as it is for much longer 
neutral, We had remembered several excellent meals but this lunch did not match any of those past experiences because we were seated on basic hard chairs in an area that had previously been a bar Starters were tasty but main courses quoted as served with salad were really only garnished  One dish included a ciabatta chicken mozarella sandwich that was rather dry and too big to pick-up  Everything was served with large quantity of fries which were well presented but we would have preferred mixed vegetables surprising constraint given the up-market presentation and menu  Staff were attentive though  Could do better - and wish we d read the other reports before we chose to go back there 
neutral, My dining companion and I spun the golden wheel of fortune this day Being seasoned connosseiurs of the genre we were completely open to the opportunities that awaited us  Of the three dragons in this stretch of the strip we went for the smaller of the group thinking we would be better looked after and secretly believed that they would all be served from the same kitchen  I hope not because I d like to try the other two  The food was absolutely fine and the chilli squid was amazing The one thing that we really found disconcerting was the strange taste of the cooking oil Thankfully most of what we ate was steamed and this was really yummy  Price wise it was OK and it seemed to be busy and popular Our choices included with a score  Prawn dumplings 8 10 Pork Cheung fung 5 10 Chilli squid 9 10 Shu Mai 5 10 Scallop dumpling 6 10 Chinese Broccoli with Oyster sauce 9 10 Hardly a banquet however these are the basic staples upon which most diners will base their meal on I would say this is a good place to go the staff are pleasant and they were attentive But with all the choice along Gerrard street and surrounds this wouldn t be my first choice 
neutral, Visited the Strada York on 10th May with my wife and 2 young boys Meal was of good quality although the service needs improving The waitress who served us didnt seem to know the menu and struggled to speak english which made ordering difficult It hasnt put me off as i do like the restaurant Just need a little more training in customer service and efficiency 
neutral, A bit of perspective is required here Two meals for a tenner is probably going to be less than a fine dining experience  There were three choices of meat All were overcooked bone dry and shredded when carved This is unforgiveable The carving table was overseen by the usual surly being who really needs the refresher course on customer services The state of the meat might have contributed to his mood  Yorkshire puddings were       sturdy If your teeth are anything other than firmly rooted and your own then you will struggle You will not struggle with the vegetables Broccoli was yellowing and limp cabbage soggy carrots soft and drying out round the edges  roast parsnips limp and soggy new potatoes starting to dry out on the outside Roast potatoes were hard in parts mildly crispy and totally tasteless Gravy was luke warm and needed an injection of something a humane end to its existence might be appropriate  As a carvery goes this was up there with the worst If a fiver is all you have to spend on a meal then make other arrangements 
neutral, Just a personal point of view but I think this place could be so much better if they sorted out how to serve the customers and organise the staff more efficiently the system they use is laughable why they can t do table service I have no idea a French style cafe service would work so much better And the picture here is clearly not from this place Looks like ripon race track Surely that is false marketing 
neutral, A taxi driver recommended this one to us The restaurant looks like it could do with 100k throwing at it but Kumar has a great pedigree from working in London We like Indian food and appreciate it s great variety but no matter how good the food is we do need a nice environment to enjoy it in Flavours suffers like many Ramsgate restaurants to much competition keeping prices unprofitable and investment down 
neutral, Came in with friends for a catch up decided to have a quick meal Not very quick Food was ok but nothing to shout about Would return but level of expectation is low So if it improves then we ll be happy 
neutral, i wanted a table for 1 and was stuck at a table obviusley used by people wanting takeaways 2 people sat at my table while waiting for food They brought the wrong main dish at 1st and not really sure if my main dish was actually what i ordered Some scruffy fella on the next table kept talking to me about all sorts of stuff so i just ate my food and got out asap Not the best value for money but was really busy 
neutral, The staff gave the impression from the start that they wanted us in and out of the premises quickly as it was a busy new years eve They were abrupt and impatient when taking the food orders The food was served quickly and was of average quality the staff were wanting to clear the table before everyone had finished their courses 
neutral, We chose this restaurant because of the TripAdvisor ratings but we re very disappointed with the food quality We both had Haddock with gnocchi with sauce with whole grain mustard The haddock was dry and the gnocchi was stodgy almost gooey There was no trace of the mustard Service was pleasant and quick The setting was nice although some people on a nearby table were seated opposite the door and complained about the draft when the outside door was opened as it led directly on to the street 
neutral,The restaurant had a good atmosphere tasty food busy vibes and good views from the window but it is disappointing to see endangered bluefin tuna on the menu - although the meat supplied to the restaurant is farmed and they have longer terms plans to remove it completely from the menu which is reassuring 
neutral,The first trick is trying to get a seated Often arrive at the door and wait more than 5 minutes for someone to come over Once seated it depends on who serves as to how your experience is going to go There are certain staff members there who don t seem to show much interest in the guest they are serving and just want to get people in and out There s a lady that works there called Lou and if you get served by her you are bound to have a great visit She is so polite and always goes out of her way to welcome you I will say that there has been a change of management that has been for the better The new general manager is really focused and whenever he is working the organisation of the team and how the evening goes is noticeable That said I think the quality of the food is always perfect It s just a shame that you never know what service you are gonna get until you get there and that s why I ve scored it how I have done so 
neutral,Enjoyed the food but when we arrived we sought out the only table that would take the three of us which was a table for six Confirmed if this was ok which it was but was asked to then share with other diners 
neutral, A dull cold rainy Saturday in Rye We and our friends were looking for a nice warming lunch We were lucky to to find space for four Edith s is quite small At first we were disappointed that hot meals were not really catered for Unexciting jacket potato soup and one or two others Tea coffee and scones and cakes seemed to be their forte Today we were in luck because a warm quiche was on the special menu One of our party is vegetarian so was happy with the soup I spied what I took to be the last slice of bake well I was told not worry as there was more out back I ordered the bakewell but when it came it seemed smaller than the slice I saw No matter it was adequate Good quality food and friendly staff I went to pay and treat my friends only to be told cash only no credit cards accepted I can be unobservant but I saw no signs announcing this None of my party spotted it either My choices were scurry down the high street in the rain or borrow money from the others I chose the latter As long as one knows what to expect from this establishment I would recommend it and may visit again for the excellent scones 
neutral, we went out to eat here before a night out in the east end i heard its one of the better curry houses on bricklane i had a madras and sag aloo with rice and garlic nan it was a good meal I ve had better nans elsewhere the madras was pretty good not as spicy as it should be  there service wasn t great but they were very busy to say the least I wouldn t mind going there again next time i m in bricklane but there are lots of other places i d like to try out on the street 
neutral,One of the many restaurants down Station Road it seems Indian might not be the food of choice down that neck of the woods as it always seems to be fairly empty in there That s a bit of a shame as the food was pretty good and it s an okay sized restaurant so has potential to be a lively place I had a chicken chat starter and Lamb Tikka Balti for main with Keema rice Decent sized portions and the cobra was kept flowing by the waiters which is always a plus Good service but you d expect this on a quiet night Very good value for money 
neutral,Visited New Years Day Not busy but not empty Staff were in short supply but pleasant Food was as could be expected in a pizza place but most things were only luke warm Big shock was the prices A pint of peroni at 5 25 seems over priced and standard pizzas also expensive Would go again with a taste card 
neutral,I ll start with a question Why do restaurants recently seem to delay bringing you the bill long enough that you have to send up a flare to get their attention This was what I remember most about my trip to Clowes The food wasn t bad but fairly typical and expected The prices are excellent and a fair reflection on the food I had and especially the service I got After waiting for about 30 minutes after the starters were cleared I was more than ready for my main it was another 20 minutes before I got it This also came after we were told 2 minutes she of course meant 20 All this happened with the staff popping over once to lie about the time it will take to receive our food  Oh and back to my first question wow did it take a long time to get the bill I mean 15-20 minutes after clearing the plates no question if we wanted a dessert or a drink Just ignorance for 20 minutes A friend went to tap someone on the shoulder for the bill 3 hours in total we were there having 2 courses 
neutral, Lovely evening with my wife to be We both had delicious fish and chips couldn t be faulted The service was great and I wanted to leave a generous tip until I asked the staff who it went to and I was appalled to discover 40 of the tips go to owners of the establishment who are apparently rarely seen 
neutral,This is a good place to eat and have a drink as long as you don t mind television and sport Everywhere you look there is a tv The place is always well patronised and the staff are friendly Sometimes it seems more staff would be appropriate at busy times We have dined here a few times and it has always been enjoyable 
neutral, This dining room tries hard to deliver a fine dining experience but falls short despite its rating in the Michelin Guide I had the tiger prawns which were well presented but underneath the presentation very standard fare The pork belly again looked good but the skin was burned rather than seared and the texture fatty and a bit glutinous The dessert proved to be a bar of rather mediocre chocolate ice cream with some nuts sprinkled on top Service was charming but rather random throughout with long waits and items forgotten  I don t mind the slightly idiosyncratic decoation and the slight atmosphere of faded Victorian glories but this restaurant needs to focus on the basics of impeccable service and food if it wants to charge double the price of the St Crispin Inn across the road where the welcome is warmer and the steak and kidney pie unctuous 
neutral, Went to The Greenwich Tavern for Saturday Brunch Staff were helpful including arranging an off menu order Pub has a nice ambience and for its location at the gates of Greenwich Park does not feel overly crowded Service was fine but the order for my food was inaccurate - the item I wanted removed was included and another was left off Poached egg was rather overcooked Otherwise it was OK 
neutral, The welcome here is great  Just because it s an  independent  coffee shop does not mean it is a quality coffee shop Unfortunately the coffee was very average All the cakes etc are served with squirted cream and chocolate powder sprinkled over  to cover up their staleness Unfortunately not impressed 
neutral, Went here in a bad mood following a night at a local hotel Half slept and really not in the mood  However the food was fresh tasty and just what we needed to lift our moods Well done to staff and owners for an enjoyable breakfast at reasonable prices 
neutral, Have been here before for Sunday lunch and was impressed but not so this time Had a gourmet hot dog  not sure what was gourmet about it though A chewy sausage on a crispy roll for 14  Soup was 6 50 Bread was really good though Not suitable for those who find difficulty climbing steps as there are over 100 to climb 
neutral, We ve been to Pizza Express all over the UK for the past 20 years This one is not the best It doesn t have the groovy feel of other Pizza Expresses This is in part to do with the layout and acoustics It doesn t look as much like a stylish Pizza Express if you compare with York or Manchester or even sleepy old Lytham The service is impersonal the food is always OK  It is not the best the salads are always really awful in particular  The service is OK the food is OK 
neutral, I ve rarely been to a restaurant with such cheap furnishings decoration and and tableware The lighting was a single Habitat-style paper-lantern on the floor casting dreary shadows and bringing to mind eating in an unfurnished bedsit someone had just moved into Wall-decoration was courtesy of a graffiti-artist and I have not seen ultra-cheap Duralex tumblers in such quantity since school-days Also not had to drink wine out of such since I was at college although the bottle itself at 20 for some very average house-wine was not very cheap No doubt the idea was to create some supposedly asian shabby-chic designer look at very little cost  Might suit some but I felt like I was dining in a garage It might have been OK if the food was great but it was a fairly ordinary version of the noodle stuff you get at Wagamama though not unpleasant The mains were not very dear though the side we had as a starter was more so at 1 for each of five ravioli-like parcels Service was friendly and efficient 
neutral, Had dinner at Dumplings Legend recently All diners were shoved into the front section near the window an old trick so table for two was cramped Service was passable but brusque Hot and sour soup vegetarian only was lukewarm and uninspired Mixed starters were hit and miss - the prawn toasts were moist and tasty but the salt and pepper chicken was like rubber Spicy pork siu loung bao were quite tasty but underfilled A la carte meat fish options looked horrendously expensive Table was not cleared after the food was taken away it would have been as simple as replacing the paper cloth so we were left positioning our elbows amongst the scraps of food You can find better experiences in this neck of the woods 
neutral, We have visited here many times either for a romantic dinner or for business meals  The last two times have had disappointed service The food has been good but both experiences let down by bad service  Not all the staff looked happy to be working and were not attentive to either what stage our meals were at or whether we were trying to get their attention  Good to see them supporting a local distillery though Silent Pool Gin is wonderful  The food is on a par with their sister pubs but service is significantly poorer It is clearly not an individual doing a bad job but a culture or management issue 
neutral, Food is very continental maybe a little up market the bar is very good and the bartenders know a lot of cocktails 
neutral, We had the sausage and mash at GBP6 95 and a pot of tea with a little bag of ginger bread biscuits whilst we were waiting The total was nearly GBP20 When the dish arrived not a long wait we were really disappointed with the quantity The plate was huge and filled with tasty gravy in which there was a small saucer sized portion of mashed potato topped with three Lincolnshire pork sausages What there was tasted very nice indeed although it wasn t piping hot but it was ok However there were no other vegetable and we thought that it was a bit of a meagre offering for the money It certainly needed something extra We could see the other dishes coming out of the kitchen and some of them looked quite substantial so maybe we just picked the wrong dish or they just forgot our veg  This was a one off meal in the cafe for us because we don t normally eat there as the food has always been a bit expensive we re pensionrs so we thought we d give it a try after the refit but we won t be giving it a second try  Sorry Clumber Cafe - reduce your prices or make the portions bigger 
neutral, I could write two reviews for The Gable a day time and a night time  Day  I ve had lunch here 4 5 times on a Friday On a couple of occasions the food was atrocious On the other occasions it was excellent Not sure what to make of that The service is bang average in reality and they could do with an extra couple of people during periods They could also do with smiling which rarely happens  Night  I ve spent many a time in here on a Thursday night Typically the atmosphere is excellent and you end up never leaving The new decor and club downstairs is an excellent addition however they have now taken away the live band on Thursday night - WHAT This is madness as people used to fill the place to have a good time listening to an average band play other peoples songs  All in all the The Gable will always have us in it s web as we are local but naturally there could be vast amounts of improvements 
neutral, Was looking forward to our pasties as we have in the past but alas we were disappointed The standards seemed to have slipped pasties were only average lacking the usual seasoning and crispy pastry 
neutral, This is a restaurant is within a hotel and in general a little disappointing unless the hotel is running a special event Breakfast is average with most of it pre- prepared and left for long periods under heat lamps The service is relaxed and some what unpredictable That said not everything to do is on the menu so if you don t see what you want it is worth asking  For an evening meal the menu is fairly small and does not seem to change and they do not seem to offer daily specials The service is very variable because they do not assign the servers to allocated tables so all staff cover all the tables which means everybody thinks somebody else is dealing with it - which is not always the case Has potential but in need of a re-think 
neutral, Restaurants in hotels are usually a bit hit and miss This was more miss than hit Service was a bit brusque and my spicy lamb dish was very one dimensional My friend s chicken dish had much more depth of flavour 
neutral, Went with a group of mates and to sum up everything the meals were average Nothing to shout home about but i wouldnt rush to go back 
neutral, Recently visited The Golden Fleece during my stay in York when exploring Must say wasn t overly impressed after hearing all good things about it Ordered a pint of Carling which tasted off so complained to a member of staff who tried some of it from the tap She said it was fine yet I disagreed and she then said that it might be the glass as residue is sometimes left from the dishwasher She then poured me a new pint but wasn t even a full pint and I didn t get an apology Whilst sitting there a group of 15 Spanish people came in some drinking some not wanting to yet the staff said to them that if you aren t ordering even a soft drink that you have to leave the pub and can t sit there and wait on friends They weren t loud nor causing any harm and the pub wasn t exactly busy and needed the seats for paying customers I found this quite shocking the fact that they wouldn t say it to a mother who had 2 children one of which wasn t drinking anything and they never got asked to leave Just found this a bit off putting the fact that my girlfriend wasn t really wanting a drink whilst in but I got her one anyway which was for the best or we would have been chucked out Please explore I don t want to put anyone off but just wasn t for me 
neutral,The pub itself has a lovely atmosphere with plenty of seating which is well spaced out The menu promises a lot but doesn t quite deliver Food was not very warm when delivered and flavours not great I had pigeon for starter which was very over-cooked and tough and kedgeree for main which lacked any seasoning Service was very slow and the waitress who I presume was new didn t take the order accurately All that said the price including the discount voucher available on their website was reasonable I think this restaurant has promise but isn t quite there yet I will probably give them one more chance 
neutral,Have visited Kitsons before and revisited on Sat 6 July The restaurant is dull and needs some lighting to improve the ambience The main course was very acceptable but the sweet was ordinary small and overpriced The service throughout was very slow - we ordered coffee some time later the waiter apologised for the delay and said the coffee would be five minutes After another long wait the waiter came and said do you still want coffee  At this point we decided to forego it and left- Raymo
neutral, Living in Isleworth I ve tried the Coach & Horses quite a few times and desperately wanted it to be better To have a good pub with good food just a few minutes stroll from home would have been great but sadly it was not meant to be  To their credit they re clearly trying very hard Attractive d€÷cor with  quirky touches   tick Interesting menu with elaborately titled dishes  tick Amusing quotes stencilled onto the walls tick Good looking food  tick Repeated assertions that they are  passionate about their food   and that they use only the  finest ingredients    tick  Unfortunately it ends there The food is presented well but it just doesn t eat well So far I ve had an overpriced undersized overcooked steak I ve had a burger that was so overdone and dry that it was immediately sent back before being told by a staff member that it was somehow my fault that I wasn t able to enjoy it as it was supposed to be cooked I ve had sausages and mashed potato that was so utterly devoid of any flavour that if I d been blindfolded I wouldn t have been able to tell you what I was eating Friends and family have had similarly disappointing dishes  And I ve never ordered a drink at the bar without first being ignored by a staff member who was otherwise unoccupied Is this the first lesson taught on day one at beer-pouring school I could be cynical and conclude that it is just a slick marketing exercise to flog cafe food at restaurant prices to people who should know better but I think that would be untrue and I do believe their motives are pure But rather they simply lack the skill and ability to deliver on what they promise and the end result is just another example of style over substance  On the plus side there are enough guests at the nearby Hilton looking for a slice of English pub culture and local middle-class families seeking a Sunday afternoon venue to host the kids and grandparents that the Coach & Horses will continue to enjoy their success and believe their own hype and good luck to them  On the down side it means they will feel no commercial pressure to do better and picky buggers like me will need to look elsewhere for a decent meal  Annies at Strand-on-the-Green is 2 miles away similarly priced and light-years ahead in terms of quality and flavour 
neutral, Visited 17th August 2013 with my wife Early evening c5 45pm before going to the Theatre Service was quite slow in terms of taking orders and delivering the food We decided to share some razor clams one the of the specials as a starter When they eventually arrived after my order went somewhere else there were just 2 on the plate and they were just about Ok maybe a little overcooked Main course arrived soon after - my wife had some pasta with seafood which she described as Ok and I had a steak with peppercorn sauce It was delivered with a garnish of half an orange  Like something out of the 70 s The steak was pleasant but add in a bottle of wine and 2 coffees for c 75 it wasn t a good experience and a place we won t visit again There are lots of restaurants in Islington and this needs to do much better in my opinion if it wants to be in the top one s It does display a TripAdvisor award but not quite sure how it managed that     
neutral, Nice location near to Oxford Street and Selfridges and at edge of pedestrian street Food mostly crepe based including several vegetarian options Mozzarella and Ratatouille crepe was tasty and a good size to satisfy hunger Prices not bad for what is a tourist location 
neutral,Visited midweek early evening 3rd week of May There were 9 or 10 of us popped in on spec so to speak and although the place was ticking over the staff found it difficult to cope The service was very slow we had to remind them for drinks several times and he got it wrong twice he had little English The staff were nice though but not very attentive On arrival we were placed at a long table in the centre of the room but after a drink meals ordered poppadoms eaten and waiting for starters a large group came in and our party among others were moved to accomodate them as the staff had forgotten that the large table was reserved Once this group came in our service got worse The food is passable Indian fayre but there are much better Indian Restaurants in South Shields I usually go to The Star of India which I cannot fault so Iam afraid its goodbye Cafe India hello Star 
neutral,Our first visit to Boomham s new Thai restaurant in the Royal Oak pub on the High Street An extensive temporary menu with some unusual dishes and an extensive veggie menu We shared a fish cake starter and had 3 main courses from the veggie menu plus jasmine rice The food was very good and the veggie options were not full of tofu as is often the case If you want tofu you should chose it There was one waitress who did well to cope as the restaurant becomes busier Orders for drinks were taken by the bar manager publican Only two real ales on offer - greater choice would have been welcome The food was very tasty BUT portions for main courses were not generous and we left thinking we should have ordered more starters or a 4th mains between two  We were given a food bill to be paid at the bar We were then also given a separate bill for our drinks One bill for both would be helpful There is also a takeaway menu available I think we might try this next time We ll certainly visit the restaurant again - it s well worth giving it some support and as a new enterprise it may well iron out some of the glitches we experienced 
neutral, the place has improved but at busy times between 7- 9 at weekends it seems that that some of the staff just want to hide- their seems to be a difficulty in the use of the tills which adds to the slowness- perhaps thats why they always ask if you want a double as most regular customers will realise that will give them ten minutes of their lives back which would otherwise be lost 
neutral, Went to this restaurant for a dinner with a friend of mine We have been warmly welcomed by the staff and get a table immediately Zoe the waitress was the star of this dining experience Professional very polite Starter was boring Sprats and an ajoli sauce with a few vegs decorating the dish  back to the 80 Main course the seafood grill Salmon and mussels overcooked 22 95 GBP for a main I was expecting a wow factor dish more vibrant fresh fragrant however although I have received a decent dish for me was definitely overpriced for the quality provided Toffee Apple Panna Cotta Peanut brittle was the hero Dessert tasty creamy and the textures were definitely there Made in a small glass ramekin was very nice and clean However the service was a bit disappointing Just the way it was served to us by the waiter It is not professional to grab the ramekin on top with the hand and serve it to a customer Attention to details is important  Good ideas however some fundamentals need to be improved 
neutral, The interior decor and feel of the restaurant is good The food is well presented and staff are polite The food is ok to good for a hotel that is at the premier inn level Don t expect fine dining or amazing flavors however it is nice Make sure you book the restaurant has many empty tables but was asked to come back in 30 minutes and they could fit me in Strange Overall I would make this is 3 8 as its not very good but it s better than just average  
neutral, Visited this pleasant pub hotel close to Steel Rigg on the Roman Wall from our home in Bardon Mill Five of us ate The bacon sandwiches pretty good Scampi and chips for 8 95 over priced and very indifferent Staff friendly Some gorgeous Thatchers cider This has the potential to be a fantastic destination pub for the locals and visitors alike but need to improve their menu and quality of food 
neutral, Staff are in a world of their own not helpfull at all Could use more cleaning Staf dress code unaceptable for Mc 
neutral, Used this pub a lot under the previous management and was excellent  Our first visit under the new team was a little bit of a let down While the food was really nice - I stuck to the specials board and the blade of beef was great  The service was very slow On a week night when it wasn t particularly busy 2 courses took almost 90 minutes and our finished plates took over 10 minutes to be cleared away  As I say food was good 
neutral, Revisiting my teenage after Mum s funeral went for a drink with the family around 8 00 p m Pub was crowded but easy enough to get served Staff pleasant but a bit overeager when attempting to collect glasses that weren t finished with None too clean but it was busy 
neutral,Not the usual sort of place we would have chosen but we had been invited by my wife s family so at 7 30pm last Saturday we arrived Even at this time the queues to get in were out of the door so first point here is it s best to book The place was packed noisy cramped and food was everywhere different choices from all over the world Small plates mean that you can t overload but you can go round and round as often as you like  So would we go again no would the rest of the inhabitants of Sutton Coldfield definately ideal for family get togethers and reunions but sadly not for us 
neutral, Many friends have said have you been to La Nostra so to celebrate a birthday we made a last minute reservation  other tables occupied including one by friends who had asked if we had every eaten at La Nostra  The service was poor the wine I ordered was not house wine and was over 20 I was not asked to taste and just poured  this occurred with the second bottle  I asked for fresh glasses but between the owner and the member of staff they did not have know how to handle wine properly  The starter was small but very good my main course was outstanding and I will return just for that but I don t want to see staff and the owner chatting with each other and ignoring the customer  but the food is a winner 
neutral, Yesterday we had lovely food - it s great value But the long-standing female bar staff member was incredibly rude to my guest I stood at the bar and heard her gossip and criticise about my friends I really wish the new Manager would get a grip on his rude staff 
neutral, 2nd visit to Grantham Arms and gave 5 stars last time but that was then and this is now Food was very good but despite the staff being friendly and polite the service was poor The facts not an opinion  Arrived 7 30 for an 8pm booking Taken to table at 7 55 and given menus 8 20 had to ask staff to take food order Ordered 2 botlles of red wine but only one left Offered Malbec instead Choose a different red also to find that was also the last one Offered Malbec again During the evening had to chase up the staff with either drinks order or dessert order In summary great food let down by poor service Unlikely to attend again 
neutral, Dropped in without a reservation accommodated us after a short wait which was good for a Saturday afternoon  Menu wasn t the best little choice went for specials Beef & Beer Pudding and a steak steak was cold so we had to return it but they dealt with that well but nevertheless should never have left the kitchen beef and beer pudding average After dinner coffee described as Colombian & Brazilian Fairtrade beans blended to gives a milder less bitter lavour profile it was very bitter It should be much better given its location 
neutral,This seafront Indian present an ambitious and inventive menu -- ranging from traditional dishes such as motar paneer to kangaroo I m calling it nouveau indian as the presentation and combination of ingredients brings together the presentational innovations of mainstream restaurant cooking -- such as attractively swirled sauces -- and unusual combinations -- such as spinach and potato dumplings with prunes and cashew Reading the unusual menu which was very obviously put together with love and imagination I became very excited -- and perhaps had high expectations However I could not have predicted the particular way in which this otherwise excellent restaurant disappointed It was that there was an extraordinary amount of sugar in the mostly mild creamy dishes we ordered Only one of the dishes tasted savoury which was a deliciously tender tandoori duck starter No problems with that But the rest of the dishes tasted bizarrely sweet I said as sweet as custard my partner disagreed that it was quite that sweet but we both found the sauces unpalatable and only ate them rather than sending them back because it was fairly late and we were absolutely starving It s important that restaurant reviews describe dishes accurately so I ll be specific about what went wrong for us I do think that probably this is a great place to eat if you avoid ordering anything mild and creamy and stick to hotter tomato-based sauces We had Hara Bara Kofta which is described as spinach & potato dumpling stuffed with dried prunes and a cashew nut and fenugreek sauce The dumplings were beautifully constructed and not a surprise that they had a sweet edge but the sauce was horribly sweet We also had had muttar paneer which they spell motor poneer This was nicely cooked but it s impossible to separate that from the really overpowering sweetness of the dish a real shame We also had bakara begun -- fried battered aubergine in once again an overpoweringly sweet sauce The duck as I mentioned was very good but the lemon rice -- perhaps our tastebuds were overcome by the pudding-like tastes of the main dishes -- also tasted as though it had been sweetened When the waiter asked if everything was OK we said actually no that so many of the dishes had been sweet He replied that it was necessary to have sugar in a creamy sauce and that was that They didn t seem interested that our experience had been so problematic If I was in Herne Bay again I would be very tempted to eat here again but would question the waiter closely as to whether sauces had been sweetened It s all a great shame as the cooking was so close to being very good indeed I d more or less say it was great in fact but just spoiled by using for our tastes far too much sugar I cook Indian food myself and while it s true that sugar can figure in creamy korma type sauces this would be in ratio of about 1 teaspoon for four portions I ve given average as a rating -- but truly our experience was both five star and one star 
neutral,Group of four out for a meal we booked after reading good reviews we were disappointed The starters were ok plenty on the plate but we had problems with the main courses One steak had to go back 3 times before it was ok the others swapped to get them ok Steak and kidney pudding was dry but with plenty of veg and gravy The atmosphere in the pub was flat there being very few customers it was also cold as the heating was out and only a convection heater was on 
neutral, I was excited to find an independent coffee house in Mcr Then I saw the barrista s dirty finger nails It is tiny place so the blokey bike couriers felt a little intimidating coffee decent I like the outdoor seating Nearly good - but needs a bit more thought 
neutral,I had breakfast here on the way to a conference It was very expensive for what it was but I thought I would give it a go  The tea was delicious as was the bacon and egg The sausage however was a tad chunky for my taste and the rest a bit standard  Perhaps it was my own fault for having high expectations but all in all it was no better than a good hotel breakfast That said places like the merrion hotel in Dublin manage to elevate the simple breakfast to higher heights than managed here 
neutral, We went here for Xmas day and although the food was good for Xmas day the service wasn t great We were all served our starters but he kids starters came out 15 minutes later and the same happened with the main course with the kids meals coming out a lot later Quality of food was good But service needs to be improved 
neutral,Another visit to this establishment not my choice and was again disappointed by the quality of food Meats and fish overcooked school meal presentation and a mix of vegetables- some over and some undercooked  The staff are friendly enough but that does not really compensate for the uninspiring food 
neutral, Recently visited for lunch with friends and we were impressed with both the decor and the menu The food was reasonably priced although some dishes were rather steep for tapas Our waitress was very nice and attentive when she could be but we could only feel sorry for her as it was a busy lunch she was running around like a headless chicken whilst what we assume to be the manager guy in suit stood and watched The drinks were reasonable and the Malbec was lovely Would have been a better experience if it had more waiting staff or the manager had stepped in and done some work Good food good drinks POOR Management 
neutral, If you want a cheap night out then Channi s at the top of Stratford Road is OK but only OK The food was not brilliant the yogurt dip thick and tasty but not sure tasting of what  the Aloo Gobi was more cauliflower than potato and the peshwari dripping in honey and too sweet All in all the best thing was the company and the Cobra beer 
neutral, I visited Kayla last month and could not fault the service or the restaurant itself However when the food came it was at a luke warm temperature and something I could have made myself at 1 10 of the price I ordered the carbonara which was very bland and overfilled with Bacon lardons which made me feel ill as they were so salty  Overall a lovely place for a special occasion  one off but not likely to go back 
neutral, This was my second visit to Biltons in the past year The first time was October 2015 I called in for breakfast which was really good I was I was impressed with how they had done old place up from its Dray & Horses days when the place had been run down over years - however  I am not for changing names of former pubs and and such would prefer the name to have stayed as it was On my second visit I was not so impressed It was a Saturday night the place was full and the setting was rather cosy but I did not find the food so great and the chips were particuarly poor - lacking both colour and flavour On a positive note my son really liked his burger which was tasty far better than the steak I ate Overall the setting was the best bit This place gets good reviews locally - perhaps I went in on an off night I would not say never again for me vut I personally would not rush back 
neutral, Went here for a mid week lunch time meal have to say the experience was fairly average perhaps somewhat less than what I expect at other Prezzo franchises Service was slow waited for a few minutes to be seated which is understandable after which our drink orders were taken immediately and we were offered garlic bread which came before any of the drinks Our drinks order then arrived in two lots considering we only ordered four drinks all of which were pretty standard they should have come quickly and all at once  We then had to watch as the chefs rung the bell multiple times for someone to deliver our food I understand that there was a large party in but surely this could have been accounted for earlier I had the Chicken Caesar salad which was nice perhaps could have done with some anchovies but wasn t overdressed as Caesar salads so often are My partner had a Calzone which he thoroughly enjoyed no matter how sad the garnishing salad was  We asked for the bill once our plates were cleared and then waited about 10 minutes for our payment to be taken it was all rather poorly timed perhaps they deserve another chance 
neutral,I used to always walk past this place and think I d love to have a breakfast there  So one day myself and a friend popped in I honestly had the best breakfast I ve ever had that morning It was amazing  I constantly return in the hope that I ll have the same experience as my first I have visited the place roughly 15 times I d guess always for breakfast However every time I re-visit the place something else is wrong something always lets you down Below is a list of some of my experiences  - The bread seems to always be rock hard to the point where it hurts your teeth when you bite it  - I once arrived at 11 40 twenty minutes before breakfast was due to stop and the lady was removing all of the breakfast menus She told me It s only lunch now sorry  I had to say to her I want breakfast  it says you serve breakfast until 12  She then spoke to the chef and sorted it out with him when I got my breakfast that morning it wasn t the best it tasted like it had been laying there for hours  - One time I was told we don t have butter  Which is absurd I had butter the first time I visited so why had that changed Every other time I go now I get butter but it s always really hard- it rips apart the bread when you try to spread it  - The staff really don t know how to make coffee I asked for a 1 shot latte recently I clearly said plenty of milk The lady came back to the table with a cappuccino in a latte glass This isn t the first time this has happened it seems to happen every time I visit  One of the things I love about the breakfasts are the small potatoes they re to die for The last time I went I ordered the Gigante as usual When it arrived it had chips on no potatoes The lady said to us there are no potatoes are chips okay  Is this some sort of a joke I suppose it has to be okay if you ve already put them on  The chips were a terrible substitute surely we should have been notified prior to receiving our food  My friend has found egg shell in his scrambled egg twice  I remember one visit the kitchen door was left wide open and all I could hear was house music blurring out  I love house music but when I pop out in the morning for a breakfast it s the last thing I want to hear  One time I received my breakfast and it had no beans on So of course I asked the waiter if it should have beans on He replied I should think so yeah   Reading back over this review I m saying to myself why do I ever go back It is genuinely because the first breakfast I had here was immense Not everything is bad obviously The sausages are unreal herbed potatoes and bacon are perfect  Every time I go in for breakfast the place is DEAD It usually has another 1 or 2 people in The Gigante Breakfast isn t cheap at 8 95 it is more expensive than most of the competition in the area If you re charging 8 95 for a breakfast with no drink it should be worth the money on a consistent basis and the service should be far better than my experiences  The reality is if this restaurant can rid of its inconsistencies it could be the best place in Liverpool for breakfast No shadow of a doubt  The management need to sit down with their staff and sort it out One day you go in there and get an amazing breakfast the next day you go in there to show your friend how nice it is and you re faced with disappointment  Sort it out Bella Italia 
neutral, Having been passing by this place decided to pop in for a tea with cakes and was hugely disappointed What decor and name might suggest to be a luxury the service and quality of the food provided are more suitable for a budget cafe Macaroons are the worst I ve ever tried really chewy and lacking a crispy crunch I had a dirty fork on the table so raised that issue with Paco who just mumbled some apology and brought the clean replacement No attention from the staff and they call it a luxury place  Will not be back any soon and definitely won t recommend On the positive side decor is lovely 
neutral,A warm welcome looked to be an encouraging start but we were lead to our table In a cavernous space at the back of the pub The food ordered at the bar  we had a drink and waited for the starters to arrive One of the diners had the spicy tomato soup which was indeed spicy and tomato but was so thick you could stand a spoon up in it Black pudding croquettes were a different story and very tasty Mains looked good but on the whole were under seasoned and a little bland A couple of things could really help this place 1 Waiting staff and 2 Don t turn the heating off at 9pm it was Baltic by 9 30pm 
neutral, Visit on 10 12 12 Ate here with friends prior the boxing and found staff welcoming The service was prompt and the restaurant was buzzing Given how busy the place was the food was served within 30mins and the quality was what you would expect I had the Chicken Americano pizza The cocktails were quite tame and overpriced I did also have to complain about my flat Budweiser lager Waitress was very good and friendly 
neutral, went on a busy Saturday lunchtime    food was ordered and arrived hot and tasty a couple of vegetarians in the party were adequately catered for 
neutral, If there was a Good category between Average and Very Good then this would be the best fit Trading Boundaries can get very busy on a Sunday afternoon We were lucky to get a table and there was some nice jazz playing  To be fair they were rushed off their feet so did well to cope The food and drinks were largely fine but some pancakes had to go back as they were cold One of us ordered chicken so I imagine they simply got the timings wrong When they came back they were good  I like the ambiance and the service is usually very good Always nice to do a spot of shopping after lunch It remains on our list 
neutral,Food is still very good but the portions seem to have got smaller Not a cheap restaurant but worth a visit 
neutral, Good food but spoiled by the large number of takeaway customers coming into the restaurant and stood around waiting for their meals Not a great experience at 8pm on a Saturday but very good at quieter times 
neutral, We stayed here for our wedding night having hired part of the venue for our reception All the staff were excellent at the Montcalm and Chiswell Street Dining rooms and everything was great until breakfast the next day The breakfast is served in the Jugged Hare which is a favourite of ours in terms of decor and atmosphere but unfortunately this was rather tarnished the morning after the wedding The morning breakfast is not cheap  30 to be exact and for that I was expecting excellence Sadly this was not the case Clearly something had gone very wrong as there were tables covered in used plates and cutlery and a lot of disgruntled people it became apparent there were 2 wedding parties in the room  My 80yr old Grandmother had to wait 15mins for a cup of tea the breakfast buffet was full of EMPTY serving trays as the queue snaked around the restaurant You were supposed to be able to order your eggs any way you liked but this was neither communicated by anyone there were no waiting staff to be seen nor being paid attention to as people were frankly taking whatever they could get their hands on as they were starving I m sure this isn t usual trade as how they could continue to charge 30 per person if they got as many complaints as I heard that day I ll never know A real shame and a tarnish to an otherwise great experience 
neutral, My wife and I visited El Borracho on Valentine s night We were off to Spain the next day so we thought it might get us in the holiday spirit On first impressions the place looked very elegant and tastefully fitted out However the maitre d that showed us to out table was sullen to the point of surly - it wasn t exactly what I would call a warm welcome The same indifferent approach was extended by the waiters and our attempt at speaking a little Spanish fell on deaf ears  As for the food - well it was nice Now nice is OK but it s also instantly forgettable  We started with some bread and tomato which was very good and we had a bowl of very nice olives I then ordered the pork belly and scallops which again was nice Soft scallop with soft tasty pork its a classic combination My wife had the mussels in saffron and hazelnut which she said was very nice We also ordered a portion of tortilla some patatas bravas and a salad to share All of which were very  and I think you can guess here  nice  So what s the problem you may ask  Well the problem is twofold Whilst the food is authentically Spanish in my opinion it doesn t reflect modern Spanish cuisine I have had the most exquisite modern tapas in Spain food that really blows the mind but this was more of a traditional take on Spanish food a colour by numbers And I m afraid instantly forgettable I m even struggling to think what I ate as I write this review  But worse than that is the atmosphere El Barracho is a big place and as such it generates  to its determent - all the ambiance of an airport terminal restaurant This was not helped by the surly attitude of the staff which didn t bother us or spoil our evening but would have made the place seem a little happier and perhaps even inspire me to return  So alas whilst the place is nice I probably won t go back 
neutral, Food was good but nothing else Service wasnt friendly It was bit expensive Charging 5 star but serving beer in a can  Not as expected  
neutral, This restaurant is trying to be a stand alone establishment but is really attached to a boutique B and B on the outskirts of Chester It thinks it is great but I don t It is style over substance and the venison was tough as old boots and judging by the way it was exchanged for the lamb this was    my fault We ate here only because we were staying at the guest house and it was convenient it is near nothing except other cheaper more honest lodging houses and a ghastly Sizzler Steak House type chain pub  which would not be out of place on the outskirts of a Hull Council Estate  Good Points  Wine List 
neutral, This restaurant offer a very delicious dishes especially kebab  nice decoration  lovely staff but a little bit expensive I recommend it for special events 
neutral,Sad to say that in such a key position with a captive audience in the sunshine this restaurant could do a lot better There was a queue gathering of maybe a dozen people and at least seven staff wandering aimlessly behind the counter No one was eating in the restaurant To be fair everything was being cooked fresh but with such a queue a little bit of prediction would have gone a long way We ordered fish and chip and chips and probably waited a good 15 minutes as did the people in front of me Someone behind got their chips first so not sure how you prioritise customers Although freshly cooked the fish was a bit greasy and good have done with draining the oil before serving similarly the chips Staff seemed hopelessly disinterested and pretty clueless about what their role in the place was Will probably try around the corner next time shame because it s so full of potential This experience was mid afternoon so no excuses about it being near closing time 
neutral, We thought we d give this a try even though we have been countless times to the absolutely superb cinnamon lounge  Decor was unusual but very good modern fresh and spacious Menu looked very varied and excellent so we had high expectations  The food and service were good but not exceptional and the portion size very small compared to other similar style restaurants This made it effectively expensive and I also left hungry  In addition they forgot a dish and I had to remind them about which they then thought was acceptable to serve when everything else was eaten without an apology  But despite this it was tasty and well intended so we will visit again and see if it improves before giving it a miss permanently 
neutral, Its average food it doesn t need to be much else capture audience with the hotel next door Lovely staff food can be a bit slow coming out would I come back here again no unless staying in the hotel next door is the honest answer but did I have a bad meal and get poisoned no Its just very average 
neutral, I use this fish bar quite a lot abnd the food really is hit and miss One day you get nice chips and the next you get soggy mess Fish is always nice but very expensive 
neutral, came here with 5 friends last night knew from the website that the food would not be the most exciting but were looking forward to a meal with friends rather than a gastronomic delight We we not disappointed nor surprised The starters mainly deep fried did not look home made but were tasty all the same apart from the mushrooms which were watery the mains were big and again tasty and mine brie and cranberry wellington looked quite rustic The chips seemed an odd shape and tasted   well odd too Service was prompt friendly and accommodating and the beer selection was apparently good although two publicised beers were not on We were not rushed but did decide to leave when the music quiz started up good value in that 6 people ate well for &lt  100 
neutral, I would rate this pub a good rather than average A stones throw from London bridge and sat on the Thames the location is very convenient There is a good selection of drinks including plenty of ales if you re so inclined  It gets very busy so it can be difficult to get a seat though it isn t usually difficult to get served Especially nice in the summer or for a spot of lunch  Average doesn t do the pub justice but very good without having eaten there seems too generous 
neutral, Popped in for a quick lunch and ordered 4 dishes and a couple of beers The staff behind the bar were helpful and informative The range of beers is very well put together  When the food came it tasted fantastic - very tasty and well presented  My only concerns were 1 the price - given what s available in the area I did not think it represented value for money The portions are very small and we 2 of us went away hungry despite spending about 20 on food 2 one of the guys serving was very surly and unfriendly  Overall great food and beer if you ve got deep pockets or just want an expensive snack I ll probably not be returning though 
neutral, Used this pub restaurant for 1 night while staying at The Premier Inn opposite It was fully- booked on the first night so we booked for the 2nd night I don t know if it s always this busy or because it was just before Christmas Lovely building inside& out Good service The big disappointment for us was the frozen chips& they had no sirloin steaks This would prevent me using this establishment in the future Such a shame The garlic bread& fish we had was delicious 
neutral, Good atmosphere Nice friendly staff Ok food fine to eat if you re in the hood not a destination  
neutral,A group of seven of us met for my Mums Birthday The table was a sensible size for our group Service was ok but a bit of reminding was necessary to get the items we ordered The food was reasonable and filling though my burger looked quite lonely on the plate Atmosphere was good Overall it was good but there was nothing that would make me particularly recommend it 
neutral, Drop in for coffee as it started to rain slow to be served machine always take time coffee could be lot hotter tables clean always a lot of people in there 
neutral, We have been to Pinocchio s a couple of times with our son and his partner they think that it is great but we are not as thrilled It is OK but to my wife and myself we have been in a lot better The last time we went there was a big group in having a party and the noise was terrible We could not have a conversation for the noise next to us 
neutral, Good atmosphere food below average and does not reach the american diner standard it is trying to hit Flavourless over done and boring Staff are extremely helpful and its good night out would be excellent but the food is a massive let down 
neutral, We ve enjoyed eating here many times before - the food is exceptional - but this was a Friday evening and two large groups of very boisterous women made such a racket that we were obliged to eat up quickly and leave  Hard to know what the current staff can do under these circumstances I appreciate The restaurant has changed hands in the last year or so - the previous owner an ex-policeman would have sorted the problem I m sure  We will return but not on a Friday or Saturday evening 
neutral, The Masons is a no frills cheap carvery In terms of value for money it is quite good but the vegetables are normally a let-down They always have a few real ales and the prices for these are very good 
neutral, I want to start of by saying that the food is insane and the new venue is great and works much better than the navigation Good points  We just walked in on Valentine s of all days and it was moderately busy We sat at the bar and asked the host how long for a table we was told 30mins we didn t mind 2 3rds down our pints and we was sat already great The burgers themselves are insane and so are the sides The pulled pork on the blackmore was incredible The wine was also nice for only 12 00pounds The not so good part   When ordering food the server was prompt and polite I ordered wine to asking for sauvingon blanc he s response was a pot of what  Then persisted to bring 3 different wines to the table none a sauvingon Eventually we got the right one after he said  I no the food not the wine I don t want to sound facetious but after working in the industry myself it s our job to know and came across a little unprofessional I get that it s an unpretentious laidback establishment but it seemed that product knowledge was lacking  Other point to say was underneath the restaurant there are contractors working loudly obviously unavoidable but loud and distracting noneless  Overall love the venue and the food and will be back just think staff need a little homework in learning the menu  
neutral, First impressions not good Directed from car park via the tradesmen s entrance past kitchen and rubbish No welcome by the staff No elderflower or ginger beer The one dish I had fancied from the website Jumbo Brixham Scallops was off Ordered 3 specials from the board - an asparagus and chicken bake and a cannelloni Took 40 minutes to arrive from ordering unacceptable for a daily special Fortunately we were not in a rush The food was fine 
neutral, Visited after work recently  but have been going to the BGI for years  New menu review  The food is of a good standard here but you will pay a premium for it - expect to pay 40 a head for 3 courses although they do have set menus for 15ea  There always appears to be more staff walking around than customers which is surprising as it took 45minutes for my main to arrive  Must improve 
neutral,Myself and my partner managed a last minute booking  We had come in after a very hot day I was casual wear and treated like I should of been in a suit so rather than being greeted with a smile and happy to see us we felt unwanted Upon ordering soft drinks we were given glasses that were barely 1 4 full as they don t have draught but yet still charged for the privilege of tenny bottles and didn t seem to concerned about giving us such small drink and questioned why were puzzled again lack of customer friendliness  So we just ordered tap water instead  The staff were efficient and the food came very quickly that I have to admit was very good  The food itself was the best I have ever had but sadly by that stage we just wanted to leave  We were in a rush to get back to Manchester so decided against desert and ordered the bill Sadly rather than a small chocolate coming with it it was literally just the bill  In a competitive town these small details count and although the food was beyond brilliant the friendliness of the waiters was not  I don t even know if it has wi fi as I did not feel comfortable asking 
neutral, Visited the Burger Shop for a friend s birthday The look and feel is very Shoreditch-y new term but feel free to use it  Exposed galvanised walls and wood works made the interior feel hip and trendy  That will draw people in that s for sure  The staff are top rate At no point did anyone at the table have to ask for anything Our table 12 people were always tended to above and beyond the call They made the time spent there enjoyable  The food was a bit of a let down The burgers and wings were bland the cheese on the hot dogs was unpalatable and the onion rings were large chunks of whole onions I ve had better van food I expected much more from a place that is supposed to be setting trends in the area  I do hope the quality of food increases the Burger Shop has a lot to offer 
neutral,Hmm coffee and tea passable surroundings superb staff quick smiling and attentive slices of cake we had definitely on the small side but reasonably pleasant Have to say it cost too much for what we had Would avoid in the future and go to the place in the park 
neutral, Service is good Staff go above and beyond for you Food however is mediocre at best and expensive Used to be particularly good  Lovely environment and staff But better pubs in the area for food 
neutral, Had lunch in this restaurant in the busy Hyson Green area The service was friendly and the menu genuinely Portuguese with bifana prego and fish among the dishes We enjoyed the bread and olives and the pica-pau for starters and chicken piri-piri for mains To drink we had a glass of wine and a Diet Coke and the bill came to just under 20 We had expected to pay more but were charged only for one portion of the chicken dish which was a pleasant surprise The coffee was also good Perhaps it s a bit mean to quibble but the cafe was quite austere and lacking in colour and the tables were very small If I were in the area I would call in again but I wouldn t drive for an hour to get there which is a shame as I love Portuguese food and it s a rare find in this part of the world 
neutral, We arrived there on a busy Saturday evening without having booked so we were lucky to have been found a nice table for two Very helpful and friendly staff but they seemed rushed off their feet The olives did not arrive with the drinks and we had to remind out waiter By the time we they arrived the starters then unfortunately arrived straight after the olives The main course was average and we asked for more water but it was never brought The bill had an automatic 12 5  optional service charge added which whilst we paid we felt was excessive and would have preferred to leave 10 cash for our waiter Overpriced for a chain 
neutral, This is your typical airport bar albeit with quite a lot of power sockets for lap tops etc which can often be an issue in other airport bars Drink is the usual draft fair food nibbles and not much else although you can always just buy a sarnie in Eat and bring it in  but if nothing else it has interesting views of aircraft landing and taking off 
neutral, Not many pubs have their own vegetarian menu so was impressed being one  Food was delicious Was so impressed that I organised a bunch of friends to have a meal there I thought I would help them out by getting my friends to pre-order their menu selection - this was NOT the idea of the pub but my idea trying to be helpful However on the night one member of the party couldn t come as she had a fall from her horse and was in hospital The dragon landlady insisted that we pay for her meal If we hadn t pre-ordered there would not have been an issue We won t be eating there again Shame as if the Landlady had been a little sympathetic she would not have lost 10 customers 
neutral, Went on an amazon local voucher which covered two courses each and a glass of prosecco for 29 Along with the bare echoey walls and high ceiling the long tables arranged end to end reminded us of a school dining room not at all the venue to choose if you want an intimate dining experience  Despite its 9 price tag my starter was truly tiny Though the rib-eye steak was tasty and properly cooked the chips with it were like railway sleepers and certainly didn t seem to have been triple-cooked as claimed whilst the vegetables incurred to an extra charge  We had a pint of lager each and the final bill including a 12 ® service charge was close to a further 29 So even with the voucher not an inexpensive evening out Okay it s Clifton so it can t be cheap but I dislike service charges added to the bill and 12 ® did grate somewhat  A reasonable evening then and the food was quite good but we won t go back even on another voucher 
neutral, first time here and had heard good reviews atmosphere pleasant in small informal surroundings and attentive staff however food let down - may have been change in chef as friends enjoyed many meals there 
neutral, We had planned to go to the Maypole opposite but it was closed for a private function so came here instead Huge choice on the menu including steaks However we were slightly concerned at how cheap all the food was We went for fish and chips and scampi and when they came they were edible but you couldn t endorse them any more than that We strongly suspect all food came straight out the freezer I had a pint of Landlord s Timothy Taylor and ale I have drunk frequently in other establishments It has never tasted as poor as this one did Not sure what the problem was with it but suspect that it was just very slightly too warm  Staff were all pleasant and helpful and service was fine  I probably wouldn t go back on account of poor food and drink unless there were no other options available  
neutral, Seems a bit hit and miss Friday night take away ordered online delivered in reasonable time however warm not hot and oil had split through the bag Free Popadoms and onion salad bits Driver relatively friendly Positives tender meat and decent portion sizes Negatives Had a discount through hungry house otherwise can be a little bit pricey warm not hot and the Currys tonight where a little bland not complaint worthy but neither complimentary Previous takeaway delivery from Balaka have been much nicer Will give them another go as have had lovely tasting and hot takeaway delivery previously 
neutral, Stale Tyrrells crisps and staff that find it difficult to engage with their customers by merely being polite friendly and professional Nice fire 
neutral, The food like in all Nando s is great The ambiance is truly unique to the chain of restaurants and the staff only help to enhance your experience However it seems to have suffered from its own success - this Nando s is probably one of the busiest I ve ever been and being a student my Nando s experiences are very extensive and as a result there is a very long waiting time for being seated and then for food 
neutral, The food was very good everyone enjoyed their meals and the lunch menu is good value The staff were very nice but there was a lack of them We had to wait a while to order and the food took a long time to come I would recommend if you re not in a rush or don t mind waiting but I won t be going back as this is the second time this has happened 
neutral, Made a reservation for Saturday for four people The Inn at Shipley is nicely decorated and has a good atmosphere The place was very busy with lots of diners We waited at the bar for a while without being acknowledged but eventually managed to order a drink and get shown to our table Our guests joined us and ordered their drinks and we surveyed the menu We have eaten at the Armoury in Shrewsbury and also the Combermere arms part of the same chain I think plenty of times and so we were familiar with the menu I ordered the jerk pork belly followed by Rump steak My food was good but my partner ordered the crispy beef salad which she found very disappointing The main problem with the evening was the service which was terrible There seemed to be lots of youngsters running around like headless chickens with no coordination or overall sense of direction The table behind us were also equally disappointed and we overheard them complaining bitterly about the service I appreciate that restaurants sometimes have staff shortages but diners should be made aware of this when we were seated The Inn at Shipley needs to up its game 
neutral, We last visited the Capannina a few years ago and received a very friendly welcome into its warm and comfortable d€÷cor We had been tempted by a themed music night and the place was full  The staff were efficient but friendly The garlic bread and starters were hot and tasty My wife s pasta was good and I had ordered steak It had been flash griddled and although a decent size the outsides were burnt so much so that I had to cut them away to make the steak edible The accompanying vegetables were only warm not hot  We wanted a rest before dessert and were pressed repeatedly if we were ready to order We eventually decided not to have desserts We were not asked if we wanted coffees or any other drinks  This was an enjoyable evening mostly due to the music and it was a shame the food was not up to the old standard that we remembered We re not sure if we would go again 
neutral, I haven t been to Pizza Hut for many a year What caused me to break my duck Well followers will be keenly aware that my spouse is a thrifty individual When she was alerted to the fact that the lunchtime all you can eat option is available for a miserly 6 99 she was all over it like a rash  We dined on a weekday and were quite surprised to find a queue awaiting us upon arrival Now I appreciate plenty of punters were chancing their arm on a cheap midday feast but it seemed as if the gentleman responsible for getting bums on seats was going about his business at a somewhat  relaxed  pace  A short while later we were shown to a table and given instructions to effectively crack on at our leisure By this juncture my tummy was rumbling like a cement mixer so I wasted no time in positioning myself in close proximity to the salad bar pizza hatch  I had heard from a good friend that the Pizza Hut salad offering was not to the standard of a well know pub chain that specialises in grilled poultry and their name means  one who reaps   Whilst this summation wasn t exactly wide of the mark I was pleasantly surprised with what had been served up  I proceeded to load my plate with the obligatory lettuce cucumber grated carrot peppers coleslaw potato salad blue cheese sauce bacon bits etc I was surprised to see jalape€¤os available A bold yet inspired moved I made sure to fill my boots although I probably went over the top and ended up consuming one of the fiery devils with virtually ever mouthful of salad  I will deal with my traditional gripe at this stage the cucumbers left a lot to be desired I would suggest that they hadn t been cut up by a dab hand Such was the inaccuracy of the slicing one was left with a bit of a messy pulp rather than even shapes Small matter but easily avoided and I feel games could be risen in the preparation department  Onto the pizza my maxim in this area is that pizza in a restaurant should taste at least 3 times better than something I or Mrs S can pop in the oven I have to report that sadly I couldn t take this view of what I gobbled at PH Whilst it was nice it didn t blow my considerable socks off notwithstanding this naturally I smashed a lot of it down during our visit   Concluding remarks it delivers what is says on the tin If you re looking for a bit of a binge on average tasting pizza for an exceptionally low price then happy days If you re more of a connoisseur when it comes to circular flat bread with tomato cheese et al toppings and just happen to have an economically focused other half you will probably leave a little disappointed but still bursting at the seams   The staff are friendly although expect to be left to your own devices 
neutral, We went today and ordered from the Lunch Meal Deal the food was OK it was hot but it was fairly bland we didn t complain we wish we had  the staff seemed more concerned with speaking to the Captain who arrived during lunch time surely if you want to speak to your staff you d come before they were serving lunch  
neutral, We had a real rollercoaster of an experience at river Thai I wanted to book a meal for a table of 8 for my birthday I love Thai food I love rivers This is both Fantastic  When I asked to book a table of 8 they said they took a five pound deposit per person for any table over 5 people I found this very unusual in Shrewsbury You may expect it in London And I wouldn t have thought they would have been open long enough to warrant such a strict policy from previous walkouts I quite simply said that I didnt have anything on me with which to pay that I had 8 people who would all be there at the stated time and unfortunately would have to go elsewhere should I be asked to pay this amount This seemed to change their mind  I then got a phone call later from the manager saying he was sorry but they shouldn t have taken that booking then explained the policy again But then he said not to worry because they were actually quite quiet that night To my mind I don t feel it was necessary for me to be told this  As for the food and the experience We arrive at 8 45 our booked time ordered drinks which came promptly and then ordered food at 9 Food came approximately at 9 45 This felt at the tail end of acceptable waiting time considering we were one of two tables The dishes don t come with rice or noodles which I would find okay if it weren t for the fact that the dishes ranged in price from about 12 to 16 pounds Then 3-4 on top for a side of rice or noodles  Understandably a river location will have higher prices but this simply felt too much for me  The food itself was very high quality came out hot seasoned very nicely No qualms about that The plates were full but difficult to eat with rice as there wasn t much room  Service was attentive toilets were nice Lovely balcony  All in all I didn t come away feeling great A combination of mixed messages about booking long waiting time and high prices mean I probably wouldn t recommend this That being said the place was decorated wonderfully good service and tasty food If the prices were cheaper I may well consider coming again but I know of other places of similar cuisine that I would prefer 
neutral, The pub looks like any other with no individual charm The menu is quite standard The service was quick and the food was of reasonable quality The food was tasty But I had to send my curly fries back as they were hard and a side dish ordered 5 mins after my main food arrived I probably won t return 
neutral, We visited on a midweek evening The meals were well presented but small quantities We have eaten at the White Horse in the past and were a little disappointed Many items from the desert menu were not available and the staff explained they had had technical problems with the freezer 
neutral, The service I feel was average the food though lacking in quantity was fine BUT the glass that my Pepsi came in was not clean particles stuck to the inside and outside did not want to make a scene as it was a 30th birthday do the cutlery could also do with refreshing  looking as though they could do with a polish Not the worst place by a long shot     
neutral, Food fantastic- as per every cheeky nandos one ventures on Was greeted with a cheeky smile and shown to our seats along with my girlfriend and 4 others we sat down on our table  Which was sticky and took away from this cheeky delight and then I went for a cheeky number 2 in the little boys room to be greeted with everyone s worst nightmare The toilet seat was no where to be seen After finding it on the floor I had to pick it up at which point I m touching cloth and have to do some DIY and assemble the loo This took away from the experience I did return 3 weeks later for another cheeky meal and the toilet seat had been reconnected Will eat again 
neutral, We ve eaten here a few times always at lunch time The food is good but the atmosphere is lacking a bit However there is plenty of parking at the rear Good value 
neutral, Being a lover of Brazilian Restaurants having once lived and worked in Brazil I was very much looking forward to trying an alternative to Bem Brazil in Manchester  I have to say that the quality of the Buffet was great and it was pleasing to see lots of traditional Brazilian dishes available it actually reminded me of a great Churrascaria in Brazil called Boi Preto which is quite upmarket and has a good name  Having said that I felt the service and atmosphere let it down it does not have the Brazilian feel that you get from the staff at other restaurants and whoever was behind the bar had obviously never tasted a real Caiprioska before as these were very disappointing who would think you could get Lime Sugar and Vodka so wrong  If your looking for some good quality food and don t mind feeling rushed to eat then give it a go but for anyone that s been to Brazil especially to the state of Bahia where dining is a slow and enjoyable then there are better choices 
neutral,When this placed first opened we were excited - it seemed to be a first of its kind in Derby A quirky little caf€÷ with an interesting menu and a nice vintage style  It started off brilliantly and we frequented quite regularly We thought the sharing boards were amazing - ploughmans cheese platters or even the basic bread variety The service is always perfect here too - the staff are like beautiful machines But then it all seemed to go wrong   and I just wonder if it became a victim of its own success I could be wrong and I m prepared to stand corrected but I am sure as is my partner that the food portions shrunk and the prices went up The last time we went was a few months back now and we shared a ploughmans which was close to 20 for two people Now I know this isn t a Wetherspoons pub but I expect more than a few slices of ham sticks of celery and a couple of slices of pork pie for 20 It was incredibly poor value  In the past we have commented on how the various boards for ONE PERSON could be enough for two   now it seems to be the other way round Its a shame because I love the style of food served here but I cannot bring myself to spend those prices Maybe I m just tight Right I m off to the Standing Order for a beer and burger 
neutral, Having read the reports we were visiting our son in Plymouth and decided to give it a try We arrived on time for our pre booked table On admission of the staff the tables are big and not a lot of room between guests We attempted to order but no fish of any kind was available I also ordered a drink but this had also run out not a good start The steak was presented and was good as was the rice and chips My wife s chicken salad was plentiful but minus a lot of chicken she didn t t enjoy it We were not asked if the meal was ok  My wife had to grab the attention of the staff member to order coffee my son and I were not asked Potential of the establishment is obvious but will cease trading if the service is not improved 
neutral, This is a typical Brewers Fare pub which serves food and drinks at very reasonable prices - especially in the weekday afternoons They never ending soft drinks and coffee deals are really good especially for the driver 
neutral, One waitress working in restaurant was amazing Shame the food did not match her efforts The food was eatable 
neutral, This is a much loved Greenwich watering hole along with bar food There are better food options in the area however it is not bad The main thing is the lack or uncertainty about what the bar is meant to be and what vibe it gives off It is rather confused at times Sports are shown small smoking area and pool tables upstairs Could do with a bit more personality seems to have been lost for more than an hour since changing from the Auctioneer 
neutral, We had a 9 15 booking on a Saturday night so were the last table to arrive We were greeted warmly and told that as a group of four we could try everything on the menu which we opted not to do The dishes were listed in order of size from smallest to largest with no distinction between starters and main courses The choices were unusual with no fish just crab or roes and the meat choice was mutton or teal Two of the dishes our veggie friend wanted were unavailable so she was left with a very poor choice although they did apologise profusely and gave her a free course of the Pollock roes The quality of the food was fine although not exceptional The wine list was very good with some interesting wines at fair prices The service was excellent The overall experience was however disappointing It seemed as though they were trying to be a cross between a tapas bar and a restaurant and not quite getting there 
neutral, Average at very best There was a rather large group of us but I was still expecting the food to come out hot Only way i could ensure this was by pouring gravy all over it We all went for roast dinners and the beef was very nice but there was not enough in the way of vegetables and the roast chicken that some ordered looked more like a starter as the portion was so small Its a classic case of nice tasting food but tiny portions Might be ok for 60+ year olds but anyone that has a decent appetite will walk away still feeling hungry For the price paid we expected more  8+ for a starter and 15 for a roast Wont be coming back in a hurry If its a roast dinner you are after I would suggest going to a nearby pub 
neutral, We went to Bank for our first wedding anniversary on the recommendation of a friend The booking system was easy enough  On arrival we entered the restaurant and it was very obvious where we needed to be A lady behind the bar then directed us to the back of the restaurant We were then taken to our table out the back This area was lovely with a nice view of the canals and NIA There are overhead heaters if you get a bit chilly Our server was very polite and friendly The initial service was good There was a slight mix up with my starter but that was resolved quickly Our food was good and the wine was also nice We thought this would be a great evening Unfortunately soon after a large table arrived close by And from that moment on we were pretty much ignored We didn t receive a deserts menu for around 30 minutes Then we didn t receive our deserts for around 20minutes And to top it off we had to go and ask for the bill As we were sat waiting for that for around 45 minutes This was very disappointing And pretty much ruined the evening for us Because of this I wouldn t be recommending here to friends and won t be quick to return 
neutral, My wife and i went to this al-a-carte restaurant last night expecting great things what a disappointment first of all the table paper place mats and paper napkins how bad is that for al-a-carte Service very poor when taking our food order i asked for a second round of drinks waited ten minutes with empty glasses finished up going to the bar myself Being a special birthday we ordered a bottle of chablis to go with the meal when it was brought to our table she said would you like to try a bit I do not know about anyone out there but i have never heard that said On a minor issue the butter dish that was brought to my wife for her bread roll had a chip in it all in all very disappointed I know some of these things might be petty but if you are paying over one hundred pounds i would expect better 
neutral, I have been here several times and its good but slightly basic The staff are never very positive they sort of doing what is required and that is all The atmosphere isn t very welcoming there is rarely much music playing Luckily the food is good I have never had a bad meal 
neutral, More of a small restaurant than a bar Too bright for my liking Good beer if a bit pricey Steak and ale pie tasty gravy but not enough meat No atmosphere 
neutral, Its all gone a bit expensive at QSF Cheapest wine at 20 a bottle says it all We had a good meal not amazing but with the wine and premeal drinks it was just short of 100 For 2 people Food was good starters well presented lots of french bread Main course of the steak was quite good but the fillet was 6oz no bigger and i was still hungry at the end Not too many people in on a Friday night so I wonder if theyre increasing the prices to cover the drop off in business 
neutral, Hadn t been to Masala Zone for a while for no reason other than we ve been enjoying trying some of the latest batch of eateries that have recently opened on the already abundantly served Upper Street strip however an e-mail featuring a special reopening offer tempted us to re-visit this one time favourite  The restaurant has undergone a makeover and looks quite stunning during our visit the staff were as attentive as ever and the tray served Thalis were beautifully presented and tasted delicious  Sadly the owners seem to have forgotten the original appeal of authentic street food at affordable prices during this transformation resulting in for us at least a slightly synthetic and somewhat over-priced experience Great food great service but just not quite right Maybe there s a lesson to be learned from the recent closure of very grand naamyaa bangkok cafe  
neutral, great venue lovely new place lots of staff and thats the problem All that staff and we still had to wait to be served The food took ages and was nice but overpriced May visit again but only as a special occasion as can not pay that all the time Could do great just need to iron out their efficiency and pricing 
neutral, We were so looking forward to going back as the food service etc is usually fantastic We wanted to take my husbands brother and his wife and had been raving about the place all day We got a table quickly despite being advised of a 40-45min wait It was very busy as usual but our table was ready in 15mins Great Sat down and ordered drinks The place was roasting hot My drink came back incorrect however it was tonic instead of sofa so no biggie and I was so thirsty I didn t care We ordered our food and our waiter was could not have been more attentive or helpful a guy named Joe  Our food arrived My order was incorrect so it had to be sent back My in-laws food arrived and both meals were stone cold They had to be sent back By the time their food had arrived we d basically finished ours so not great timing Our waiter was very pro-active and couldn t have apologised enough He d already sorted out a discount and removed our 25 starters Not a great experience this time and we were really disappointed Will give it a break before we try it again 
neutral, Beautiful old pub in sunny Lactodorum  a confused pub come eatery  for a pint very pleasant mild mannered old English pub  for food corporate chain of microwaved come slam in the oven for a qwick heat up cardboard  marked up by one star due to character and another because it s a pub that serves beer silly - 
neutral, I made a Dinner Reservation for 3 They asked for a Credit Card Number which is not very unusual What is however very unusual is that when I checked my account later that day I noticed that the Restaurant had taken  30 out of my account I do object to Restaurants doing this It is fine for them to take a Credit Card as Security  i e if there are no shows  then it is probably acceptable to take money for a cancelled reservation but to take money 4 days before the Dinner is simply not on I do not think that any Restaurant is justified in doing this This has of course soured my visit very much and probably tainted my view of the whole experience as I was still fuming when I went there for the actual Dinner The food was not bad not outstanding but also not bad It also took a little bit over 20 Minutes until we managed to place our Order although we asked several times to place an order The whole experience mainly due to the upfront payment spoilt the whole evening somewhat 
neutral, The meal was very tasty but when one asked for English meat one just got a vacant look One can get Irish or British or Scottish meat but no English meat Can one let me know when one is going to put English produce on the menu there are lots of producers of good English meat they must be exporting it all    meal was very tasty but the portion of meat was very frugal and was not worth 8 95 and one did not offer the free ice cream sundae 
neutral, The whole point of branding is that you know what to expect before you go in This is a good Starbucks I go there a lot But it is rather like many others Which I also like 
neutral, We ve been in Rosemary s few times before in earlier years so went in for lunch There was a disinterested lad and a girl who seemed to be doing most of the work After placing our order we waited about 30 min for our food The pot of tea for two which barely filled two tea cups had been delivered earlier and had all but gone Whilst we were waiting people sat at tables uncleared from previous occupants and waited quarter of an hour for a scone to be put on a plate The lad shouted across the room to a couple that fruit scones had run out rather than go over to them When I asked the guy in the kitchen how long the food was going to be he just seemed annoyed at me and totally unapologetic We weren t the only table where meals arrived at different times - with other tables served in between The atmosphere was pretty terrible because the customers were generally unhappy It s a shame because the food s good and the choice is good better than Koffee and Kreme next door 
neutral, The food to be honest is not bad here Especially the grilled food Did not enjoy the curries here My only gripe is as with many restaurant in this area is the restaurant is always dirty inside with sticky chairs and tables and disgusting toilets Management sort it out 
neutral, We found the Rhone Valley Wine Lunch disappointing One starter and one sweet were served in exactly the same style the only difference being the colour of the macaroon and the flavours At first glance it was as if the starter had reappeared but the macaroon had turned green We thought this a lazy attitude for a Michelin star restaurant The pre-desert amuse -bouche was a strange combination of flavours The bavette of beef was chewy rather than tender The courses appeared too quickly and we felt rushed Having been to two top restaurnamts in Berkshire during the past month this was definitely a let down  We would mention that we have dined at l Ortolan on many previous occasions and not felt dissatisfied 
neutral,Let s be honest we all go to a Hungry Horse for value for money food & they do do good value food The food s not great but it ain t bad either Generally The Sunnyside is your standard Hungry Horse big noisy full of kids running around I had the beef steak & ale pie which was good full of meat no fat or gristle decent pastry My wife had a rump steak cooked rare but was quite dry & a bit fatty My daughter had the macaroni cheese which was OK she ate it all which is always a good sign  We did have to wait a long time for the food 30-40 minutes  which was a bit surprising because they weren t overly busy But you can t complain when the macaroni & pie were priced at 7 99 for both meals & the steak was under a tenner This place isn t for fine dining but for those on a tight budget & unfussy about the surroundings it does the job 
neutral, Bardsley s has become a bit of an institution in Brighton and gained a reputation of being the best for miles around From my experience over the past few years and recently prompting this review I have come to the conclusion that they are trading on this past reputation as the food is far more expensive that other fish n chip shops the portions are quite small and it really isn t any better than anywhere else In fact I ve sometimes found their chips to taste quite sour old  The food at the one next to Sunny Foods in Beaconsfield Road is better as is the one in the Dip at Hollingbury the one in Patcham and the one half way up Southover Street I don t know their names but they are far better than Bardsley s and a lot cheaper too I suspect that people go to Bardsley s because they did when it was the best alongside 7 Dials which I think went years ago  and they haven t ever challenged that belief since No fish n chips in Brighton or Hove gets anywhere close the quality of the places on the seafront in Hastings but this place really isn t our best effort 
neutral,Came here with friends was pretty late but fairly busy Friendly staff and nice food Although presentation isn t what is stated on the menus pineapple rice in half a pineapple was actually just spooned into a bowl and just 2 prawns come on ice paid 9 for this rice The duck main was delicious though I just didn t like the surroundings rice inside the tables with plastic fruit isn t really my cup of tea Although I would return due to the food and service I received 
neutral,It s alright Manchester city centre really does lack a decent chippy and Wrights really is just the best out of an average lot The one thing Wrights has going for it is its central location so I do find myself choosing this one over the rest You can also sit inside which is good  The chips are usually quite nice Again nothing special Same with the fish With their portion sizes personally I feel they could be a lot more generous  I ve eaten a lot worse but I ve also eaten a lot better Tourists wanting to try a truly traditional chippy are better looking elsewhere i e not in the city centre 
neutral, Lots of pasta small amount of mussels and prawns and over sauced with tomato However the staff were helpful and charming 
neutral,We went for Sunday roast that was a little disappointing  Lots of it but very much pre-processed cut meat and overdone Yorkshire in a flood of gravy I guess it was kiss for the price but would look at other options locally
neutral,This is the first eating establishment you come upon when you clear security at Gatwick North Terminal As a result it is mega busy all the time and the staff are under considerable pressure hence the untidy nature of the eating area We arrived at about 6 pm on a Sunday evening and nearly all the tables had a Reserved notice on them - I have no knowledge of why but when we asked for a table for four they looked around chose a table and whisked away the reserved sign Like all Wetherspoon establishments you have to order your food at the bar and have to collect your own drinks to take back to your table One of our party ordered a tea which was stone cold by the time our food arrived and no offer of a free refill Food was well cooked but took about 15 minutes to come Beer was cheap as always Advice - Good if you have a long time to wait for your flight but if time is tight then move on through the departures hall and go upstairs to the myriad of eating establishments on the mezzanine floor which tend to be quieter the further away from the entrance from Security 
neutral, Surroundings and menu looked beautiful despite this chose pigs head and black pudding with a fig glaze Black pudding and Crockett were warm in places nothing hot This set alarm bells ringing Chose roast beef and Yorkshire pudding for main course Roast beef was beautifully cooked but Yorkshire pudding was burnt on the outside undercooked on the in which was sent back Staff were attentive and dealt with thi straight away Potatoes appeared to have been cooked previously and then somehow undercooked in the middle We were given extra sauce with our new Yorkshire puddings this was acrid and had obviously caught in the pan I feel lack of attention stopped this being a very good restaurant This was reinforced with three staff standing over the road smoking and as we were paying the bill the waitress although helpfull and attentive proceeded in cracking every knuckle in both hands 
neutral,A big place space bedecked in a theme of brown - leather wood - and chrome  The burgers were pretty good - but this was pretty basic fare - just an upmarket burger and fries bit on the dry side but reasonably good Some salad and tomatoes would not go amiss hint  No draft beer though some reasonable lagers  At first we thought the waiter was a bit weird bit then we agreed he was just offhand  The coffee was cold Some of the deserts were dry cake in a coffee cup with ice cream on top for 5pounds a head  Would probably suit a group of younger people on a night out who didn t really care too much about the food and service 
neutral, Visited this restaurant with friends mid week and it was far from busy ordered my favourite lamb jalfrezi and to be honest it was disappointing to say the least far too much curry powder used for my liking The standards of cooking seem to have slipped in the 12 months since our previous visit think it will be some time before we return 
neutral, Staying in the Holiday Inn Express you have little choice for evening meals The menu is extensive and always well cooked  If it was with the family it would be better the staff are attentive and polite service can be slow which in a large restaurant as this can be expected 
neutral,Visited Coventry for a wedding and had time to kill on the Sunday so - craving a roast - my girlfriend and I had a look around for a decent place to eat  We found the Blue Bistro after a lot of wandering and when we arrived we were bowled over by the interior and atmosphere it created really impressive looking  Unfortunately we then had to wait half an hour+ for our roasts to turn up which seemed to be the theme for our time there as two other tables waited a long while for their food Not sure why this was we were told half-heartedly that they only had one chef on - I m sure one chef can cope with four tables   but we were provided with a couple of large glasses of red on the house for the wait which was a decent touch  When it did finally arrive it wasn t the most inspiring roast I ve ever had I had the beef which came with the smallest Yorkshire pudding in existence and three under-cooked roast potatoes plus veg Nice gravy but the yorkie and potatoes were a big let down the best part for me   My girlfriend had the chicken which she said was good but that was about it  We shared a creme brulee which was good but left feeling underwhelmed compared to the feeling we got when we walked in  I d be worried if I was in there when it was busy  shame 
neutral, Visited one week after reopening  Food was fine but   where was the joy Restaurant is very gloomy and hotel corporate rather than Italian inspired  More disappointing the food wasn t bursting with the zingy Mediterranean flavours we were expecting and hoping for  Having seen Giorgio extol peasant food and flavours on various TV programs the menu seemed in tune with the hotel - corporate  As a frequent visitor to Italy and a massive fan of the cuisine we had hoped for so much more especially as it is not a bargain to dine here 
neutral, Myself and my wife were wandering around Covent Garden looking for something fairly simple for lunch There were lots of stalls selling meatballs burgers pulled pork etc but we wanted something a little less meaty  In the end we opted for Hola Paella  We ordered a medium and small size based upon looking at the plates they had on show with a chicken skewer each Unfortunately the person serving us didn t really load the plates up so really it felt like we had ordered an extra-small and small  The food itself was very tasty both the paella and the chicken Of course the main ingredient of the paella was rice but the amount of seafood was pretty paltry A couple of prawns and a mussel shell each I didn t find the mussel itself  The amount of seating is limited but given the size of the portions we didn t hang around and quickly vacated our table for someone else If I was given the choice again I d opt for a burger from another stall It s easier to see what you are getting 
neutral, A recent visit to our previously 5 star rated restaurant sadly didn t live up to expectations - the chicken Satays were not cooked properly and one portion had to be be returned 3 times the rest of the food was OK but lacked something compared to all of our previous meals Maybe the chef had an off day but Satay shouldn t be that difficult to get right 
neutral, My wife and I went to Luscombes on a Saturday night The staff are fabulous very welcoming and attentive The setting is wonderful with the dining room very relaxed and not fussy at all  My wife had the Tuna Carpaccio and the Beef which was very nice indeed I had the sardines and monkfish and although nice could have done with a bit more seasoning It may be my palate but Sardines can take a large pinch of rocksalt to crisp up the skins For dessert we shared the banana tart tatin with peanut butter ice cream  the ice cream was heavenly but the tart a let down   the base was just a blind cooked round of puff pastry with the bananas laid on top just before serving which meant the pastry was very dry and flavourless  We also had a bottle of wine water and coffee afterwards and the bill came to 120  So in summary the food is good but it needs that finer attention to detail to make it great and also justify the prices as in my opinion the bill was about 30- 40 to much especially when there are other establishments very close that are in the same market and have already got the package right  Saying this I will try Luscombes again probably for Sunday Lunch I hope that they prosper and achieve the Michelin star that they are obviously trying for 
neutral, We had a early dinner and had the 3-course set menu The food was as expected and we enjoyed much  The server on the other hand could smile and be more interactive than only checking if everything is alright  Thumbs up for the bartender for the great cocktails though  Overall we enjoyed our evening 
neutral, Rubeez was ok Nothing to complain about  The food was good without being remarkable The service was good and the price fair I would go again 
neutral, Having travelled from North Wales for a long weekend to stay with family We went for a few drinks and a meal at The Fleming Arms The drinks were good with real ales But they let themselves down badly we ordered the meals and when they arrived after a long wait they messed up the order which meant one meal had to go back i was told that the meal would be served within about five minutes but the wait was much longer as the rest of the party had just about finished their meal when mine arrived This should not happen when the till receipt was correct but the meals were not the same as on the order It spoilt a good night Never had a problem there before but will think again befor I ever would return 
neutral, We have been getting chips from here for years but lately the fish has not been good nor the chips there are better chip shops in Wisbech 
neutral, Beautiful setting lovely and relaxing views looking over the river The food was very nice what we got but very small portions 3 course meal was just about enough for me but my husband was still hungry by the time we left The service was not bad at all but making reservation was a nightmare they just don t answer the phone I had to go there to make a reservation obviously that would not be possible if you don t live local Quite pricey for what you get but you are paying for the setting so it is still worth the experience 
neutral, There are lovely views of the Riiver Brock if you can secure a table by the picture windows The cafe is a bit like a slightly upmarket motorway services I find the hot food old fashioned in style overcooked and underseasoned There s a decent selection of cold food with the salad bar probably winning the prize for best value Generally prices are on the high side of reasonable Coffee is dreadful The staff are nice but it takes them a while to clear the tables In the Gents the urinals are in the form of giant porcelain flowers You can buy postcards of them if that s your thing 
neutral, I found Caboose because of the 1 on Trip Advisor and put it to my mates Firstly I d like to say that comms was slightly slow but adequate enough we did have a lovely evening and the food was very good but personally I felt the experience left me feeling like I had to make excuses for the place to my friends as it had been my idea  Who charges 5 corkage but equally doesn t sell alcohol  Don t see how that is fair but accepted it as per of the experience  toilets are available but are portakabins shared by other street food vendors in the immediate vicinity  the alternative was to wall to a nearby pub they have an agreement with  Starter was really nice and Main amazing with some great slow cooked beef and pork on offer aides were equally good  dessert however were Bakery bought brownies with shop bought Ben & Jerries ice cream  I appreciate this is a prime shoreditch brick lane east location but the 35 per head my meal was didn t live up to the hype despite being able to play my music of choice on their iPad  Do go but just be aware of the circumstances wouldn t choose to go again 
neutral, Have been here several times before On this occasion we went to a theme night Midnight in Paris which cost 20 per person in addition the cost of our meal and drinks The 20 included a glass of sparking a rice ball and chicken liver parfait on a small piece of toast I was expecting more for 20 My starter of mushrooms was tasty but there wasn t enough I had a vegetarian main which I fedback on the night to say that some of the veg were very undercooked and I felt my comments were ignored My apple desert was not particularly memorable Would I go to another theme night there  Probably not Would I eat there again I d probably give it another go at lunchtime when the prices are more reasonable to see if they were having an off night Having eaten there several times before the food seems to be very different to what I ve experienced before and sadly not for the better Overall I didn t feel full after eating a 3 course meal it was expensive for what it was however on the upside the staff were on the whole very friendly there was a nice atmosphere and I still had a good night out with my friends 
neutral,Have been there Not once  Always the same story  1 a long queue to the bar if you are without a reservation take your card details in case of cancellation etc  2 have to pay for the entrance 20 person if you are going to come after 10pm 3 always crowding - no space to dance & sometimes difficult to breath  4 great presentation of cocktails nice but costly 5 majority of people are completely wasted 6 lots of expats 7 many pretty girls but it is doubtfully due to of no light and alcohol cocktails 8 very long queue to the sort of clock room   But if you are there because of your friends who don t care about mentioned above and you share their lifestyle etc then you are very welcome 
neutral,Excellent service average food that could be good with more attention to detail relaxed atmosphere reasonable value for money
neutral, We have visited The Old Bakery several times before and given it glowing reviews our last visit however was a disappointment  The service was as usual very efficient and friendly we were well informed by our servers and the wine package was explained in a knowledgable fashion we had a lot of friendly banter with everyone that served us so situation normal  The food however was well below standard in my opinion it lacked the wow factor that we had come to expect from the establishment which appeared to be the result of cost cutting in the ingredients used I understand the need for cost control in order to maintain profitability but not at the expense of customer dissatisfaction  We did not complain but left a little bemused by what we had eaten certainly if this had been our first visit we would not have returned however having eaten there in the past we hope that this is just one of those nights and that when we return again it will be back to it s former glory 
neutral, Have used this venue twice a year for last 11 years and until this latest trip have never found fault But and it s a big BUT since refurbishment last year all the more mature waitresses seem to have been replaced with younger staff who were overwhelmed  We have until now never been turned away for not booking especially when staying in the attached Premier Inn but on this occassion we were made to return in1 2 hour this is was despite counting get at least 12 empty tables still empty when we returned Then 1 2hr wait to be given menu and place drinks order Another 1 2hr before food order taken then 3 4hr wait for starter superb main was very poor and late eating made for uncomfortable night sleep  Breakfast was totally different familiar mature server Pat like being in two different restaurants Only problem we were still bloated from late dinner to do breakfast justice  Come on Befeater get some experienced waiting staff back 
neutral, Stayed here for three nights as working in the area bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was very good too I stayed in room 4 which had recently been refurbished I did stay over the weekend and they had a band on which I could hear in my room but to be honest I was so tired it never kept me awake If working in this area I would stay here again Also has free parking and WiFi Which is a bonus 
neutral, Went on Friday    to be told they run out of LOBSTER like really that s like so not cool spoilt r evening   
neutral, having been to this restaurant before we was looking forward to a nice quick  but not in a fast food type of way meal    the place was busy as usual and after only a small wait for a table we sat and ordered   the wife went for a veggie burger and myself the classic burger with bacon and cheese the food arrived and we tucked in only for the wife to find a lump of black stuff upon which closer inspection we found the rest of the charcoal lump that was stuck in the middle of her burger  i told the waitress who was very apologetic and immediately offered a new burger and a refund on her original meal   the replacement came very quickly along with another offer of any food or drink we liked but sadly my wife had lost appetite and only ate half of her meal Its such a shame that a small mistake can put you off a place but i dont think we will be back for a while at least But other than this its a nice place with a different selection of burgers to try 
neutral, Good service but not much food selection nice views and local beers friendly staff  average food portions nothing spectacular would reccomend if going for lunch or you enjoy the scenery 
neutral,   that night when both of us had acid reflux we think from the black pudding mash that went with the belly pork  As it is quite expensive I shall think twice before revisiting 
neutral,Yes the food was quite nice nothing special The restaurant is very nice inside very quiet when we visited so no atmosphere Maybe we just booked the wrong time slot The waitress was very helpful and tried her best to meet any requirements we had Just felt overall this was overpriced
neutral, As it goes with F & B the food is good as you can expect They do have a few nice breakfast options like American Pancakes Parking is easy and the setting is nice 
neutral,Found this pub by chance whilst taking a Sunday afternoon drive The pub was very busy but had plenty of parking There were lots of things in the garden such as bouncy castles ect if you had small children We had not booked but the staff were very friendly & helpful & although the place was packed we seated seated very fast We had different starters that were ok the mushrooms in Stilton sauce did not work very well & we all settled on having a Sunday roast which came up nice & fast considering how busy they were The food was not that great great to be honest although the setting & the staff were very nice 
neutral, We went to this hotel restaurant after evening racing expecting that it might be a little lively In fact it was a little like finding oneself at afternoon tea in an old-folks home The restaurant itself is a bit away from natural light which does not help The staff were fine but not overly cheerful The food was what passes for sophisticated in English market towns i e not very but very average in quality Perhaps we were unlucky in our choices or perhaps the accountants have attacked the chef s budget The wine was expensive for what it was  Sadly this is probably the best there is in Newmarket a town which seems very keen to cater for those who prefer spicy and oriental food - late night drunks perhaps   
neutral, We visited a few weeks ago in a party of 10 for a Sunday lunch The food was good not excellent The setting everything was quite lovely Staff were attentive and service was good Our main courses were Beef or Lamb Like I say food was good but nothing special The cost was 13 95 for 3 courses it wasn t expensive although not cheap either At that kind of money I was expecting a similar meal to that on offer at nearby Beckworth Emporium near Sywell My afters was fruit crumble and custard which had tinned peaches in it - it really was quite horrible perhaps my taste So in conclusion the food was OK but would I go back probably not Unfortunately there are in my opinion better places to lunch on a Sunday I would rather pay the extra  or two and have a really excellent meal which sadly this was not 
neutral, Popped into here one evening to have pizza  We ve a Pizza Express local to us and it is delicious everything comes out beautifully fresh and flavourfull  So when the pizzas arrived and we started eating to find out they were OK but nothing special and no as good as what we can get at home we weren t overjoyed  Service was rather slow too plus sitting on the terrace outside on the first floor we were getting mugged by wasps who arrived soon after the pizza was delivered  Overall you could do better elsewhere 
neutral, Lured in by the 30 discount off food the restaurant is sort of upmarket TGIF with waiting staff perched at the end of your table taking the order nice ambience busy on a friday evening Bit noisy staff nice n friendly with plenty of seating in booths  but if the place is going upmarket then someone needs to tell the Kitchen to up their standards Thai fish cakes made with salmon not too authentic sounding or tasting fajitas ok but no better than TGIF pork belly inedible bit greasy bland  really horrible  to be fair the dish was taken off the bill but that s not the point really it shouldn t have been allowed to leave the kitchen   or the pig even  Conclusion Go there for the atmosphere but don t expect even gastropub food The bill even with food discount is still likely to be in the 40s per person 
neutral,After all the good reviews we got a takeaway Pasts was ok not much sauce or meat Not sure why it is rated so highly as it wasn t a bargain either 
neutral, Six of us went for dinner on Saturday night I had the langoustine tortellini pigs trotter and the pistachio souffle They were all good but they all seemed a bit half finished not quite rustic French or fine dining The main definatly needed some veg and I don t expect to have to order a side to make up my meal If it was in a GastroPub then it would have been fine Our main complaint was the service - it started off well and then seriously tailed off - whether it was because we stopped ordering wine at the end of the main 3 bottles already finished I don t know but we had to get their attention to order dessert having been left for 15 mins then with the 15 mins reqd for the souffle the evening was seriously dragging I don t want to be rushed when eating but 3 hours is stretching it a bit Had been looking forward to this for so long and really wanted to love it and was left disappointed - we all were a bit Had I only paid the 39 for the fixed price it would have been good but 110 a head  Now afternoon tea at the Langham the next day - that s a different story - amazing food and service   
neutral, Disappointing visit not their fault but screaming kids at 9-15 am 3 September 2015 is not the start to the day I want I was later surprised that customers were allowed in with a very small dog not a guide dog in the coffee shop and Bistro - not good 
neutral, Living in London Cote is a familiar sight They deliver with service but rarely excel Better than the usual chains pizza express strada prezzo etc  Their desserts are worth trying I ve been a few times and would go again 
neutral, We stayed at the adjoining Premier inn arriving early se decided to grab some lunch before checking in on entering the restaurant at 12 10 we were told they weren t ready and to sit at the bar After around 20 minutes other people entered and were seated in the restaurant area so we found a table and waited and waited but no member of staff brought us menus but proceeded to serve several tables around us my wife approached a waitress and asked for menus with which she replied as we had been sat at the bar we were only drinking the staff need to talk to each other When we did eventually order and the food arrived it wasn t great cold fries also the area was very dirty seats need a thorough clean  We had reservations about breakfast as we had pre booked however we were looked after by Ben who was very professional and received exactly what we ordered Maybe the breakfast staff should Train the lunchtime staff in customer relations 
neutral, Great location with a fantastic view over the Minster valley  Staff polite and helpful with plenty of outside seating available Excellent selection of beers and ales including Erdinger Alcoholfrei which has to be the best non-alcohol beer out there  
neutral, Been here few times b4 about 6 months ago seemed 2 have gone down hill abit food came out warm was not in mood 2 complain was enough food shame as staff was nice but than went 2 bathroom toilet had no locks on any doors+was no hand wash which I think is bad 4 restaurant 
neutral, Have eaten here many times Very nice if you can get a seat outside overlooking the river on a nice day Food has always been good staff always very friendly Quite expensive for a pizza restaurant I would say However my main complaint would be about the people who let their noisy children run around the restaurant The staff really should do something about this 
neutral, Arrived at 8pm on a Saturday night without a reservation Was asked to grab a drink in the bar area and expect a 25 min wait which we were ok with  Nice table comfy seating ordered drinks The drinks din t arrive so after ten minutes I called another waiter and re-ordered We had the a la carte menu rather than the buffet Food was very good lamb chops to start Tikka Marsala for main The problem was that we waited 35 mins between courses and were offered no apology  Think that they struggled to cope on a very busy Saturday night with what seemed like a minimal number of staff  There are a number of quality eateries on the same street Next time we ll either try the v=buffet or venture over the road one of its many neighbours  Paid 63 for two of us inc 4 large beers and a bottle of house rose wine 
neutral, It s not a bad restaurant but it s not a great restaurant and it s the only place you can go if you fancy Thai in Dorking and to my eyes that lack of competition has resulted in complacency The place just isn t special enough It s fairly small inside and can get really busy especially at the weekend when the well-to-do come out to celebrate their birthdays The food is fine but uninspired It tastes like it should but is pretty much choose your meat choose your sauce and add rice or noodles There isn t much more too it than that and there should be That was fine 10 years ago but to really impress the Sang Thai needs to inject some new ideas into it s food it s presentation and it s staff or the restaurant is going to age into retirement alongside it s customers 
neutral, Bring mentioned in the Michelin guide I thought we d dine well here The starters were very nice crab cakes and breaded camembert really tasty food Desert was very nice too chocolate mouse But the main courses disappointed  I had the cote de boeuf with chips which came with a supplement Asked how I wanted it cooked I explained that I usually have rare but what ever the chef thinks is best   you can have it how you like love   was the response so I stuck with rare My wife went for the fish and chips When it arrived the steak was very big but a bit thin and probably medium rare and a bit chewy in parts And of the 6 or so trendy chunky chips at least a couple were not cooked and hard in the middle If you re going to do chunky chips please get them right Fish was fine and very large but again a couple of under cooked chips  I know this is pub grub but the fuss about the mention in the Michelin guide made me expect better Staff were very friendly and the service was good Maybe I got a bad bit of meat and spud 
neutral,Good time with friends and cheap shots but the local tart who shows up at your table to offer free drinks only then to subsequently charge 4quid a round is somewhat annoying 
neutral,Standard price standard  formula  middle of the road Innkeeper Carvery Penty of off road parking and pleasant staff less crowded than many on Sunday afternoon or evening and they do always keep everything piping hot  [Kids can eat free with a paying adult]
neutral, One thing to underline  the food is good Pricey but okay Staff are good but they need more of them  8 covers in our party all eating and finishing at different times Poor Only ordered mains Two waiters  with a tray each and it would be so much improved And not cocking up the order The business model of customers ordering is okay  but not without an order note book This is fundamental surely More staff  to serve Give covers an order pad  real or interactive Add a waiting area or bar as waiting area  you ll make money - honest  Disappointingly ranks 3rd out of the 5 similar establishments in the city  Not in a rush to return 
neutral, Went to the crooked billet for lunch today yes it was shocking   Long wait for not the best food but in all honesty it is just fried spirit grub What really should we expect sun shining beer garden packed with council estate kids staff run off their feet shocking honesty of today s world of working in hospitality   One thing that stood out for me young ginger lad ran off his feet but amazingly compromising obviously trying his best didn t get his name but well done you sorted out what could of been a disastrous lunch for us you turned it around young man who ever you are thank you 
neutral, Ordered a takeaway from the merged Spice Merchant Pagea on Poplar Road The Mixed Grill  6 25 starter was a pleasant enough array of meat to start my Indian odyssey off on However I was underwhelmed by the Garlic Chilli Chicken  7 35  Fried rice  2 50 and Garlic Naan  2 50  Feel ashamed that I cheated on Imlees in Moseley by trying something different whilst my wife was away and this was compounded when checking that the collection discount of 10 at Pangea compared poorly to the 20 at Imlees Whilst the food here was okay I think there are better pickings not too far away 
neutral, Went to Caffe Nero during a shopping trip with 3 other people It was busy and whilst I accept they want to get drinks out it might help by getting the tables cleaned a bit quicker Coffee was ok That is all  
neutral, I think we may have been unfortunate picking a night to dine in the restaurant when it was understaffed There was 8 tables occupied but only the one server and as charming as she was she seemed way out of her depth  I was in a party of three and we all ordered the set menu for 3 people We had to wait over 45 mins for our starters to arrive and when they did it was only for two she apologised and we then had to wait a good 10 minutes before the third starter arrived Reading the reviews on the quality of the food I did expect the starters to be better than they were After finishing the starters we then waited over half an hour for our main meals which tasted better After waiting a while again we asked for the desserts and she looked confused and had to check the menu to realise that these were included in the set meal When they finally arrived one of them was missing the vanilla ice cream and we were informed with a smile that they had run out The drinks especially the wine were on the high side  As I mentioned the server could not have been more friendlier but having to wait patiently so long for our food especially when you can see the kitchen preparing take away orders while you are sitting in the restaurant ruined what should have and could have been a really nice pleasant evening 
neutral, We were luck enough or so we thought to get a cancellation and move from the packed bistro into the main restaurant overlooking the harbour All was well until the waitress supervisor came to take our order At first all was well and she asked whether we were ready to order She then realised that we had swapped from the bistro and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not residents had not booked and were walk ins  Therefore we would have to wait and would be put to the back of the list She then walked away and asked another table whether they were ready to order leaving us in a state of shock and anger We were treated like second class citizens just because we had not booked in advance How shameful  We complained to the manager and to be fair he did apologise having witnessed the event and gave us some wine on the house restoring some of our faith 
neutral,Spontaneous lunch arrangement having visited previously without any issues seemed a justified idea Arrived and was told to sit wherever we wanted apart from the booths on the far side Waited far too long to be brought drinks and noticed my glass seemed to have mud on the side I asked for a clean glass which was brought back to me topped up- standard customer service with an apology  Food came which was very average but we did order from the lunch time menu so was not expecting anything outstanding I found a hair underneath my chips having already had a dirty glass I was going to let this slide being British and as this does happen occasionally  As I approached midway through my glass of the black stuff my partners eyes widened A thick black ring of residue around the inside middle of the glass How was this not spotted after I had already complained once about a dirty glass I could no longer let this slide  I expressed my concerns to the waitress who went to speak to a manager offering no initial apology The manager who had previously swapped my glass came to offer apologies and standard compensation for the meal and a voucher for a return trip 
neutral,Went there last saturday 16th May afternoon   Architecturally its stunning with great views from the terraces & balconies  Service was appalling we were not ordering food  just beer took an age to get served  the staff seemed more interested in chatting to mates & each other When we did eventually get served the beer was dreadfully dispensed & the staff didn t seem to know the procceedure  disappearing for minutes on end to get change & glasses etc  The first Pint I ordered was clearly off Cloudy & stank  I reordered  the second beer was end of barrel  Third time lucky I ordered same as friend  We found table on roof garden  But ended up leaving the beer it was awful  We went back down stairs to see what else was on offer & ordered 2 more pints of different ales  Mine wasn t great & It didn t clear so I took it back & chose yet another  My friend drank some of hers but again it wasn t right  Maybe it was opening week teething problems but staff training etc should be sorted & keeping Ales in fine fettle is a must 
neutral, We came here as a random drop in whilst working nearby Staff were efficient but we didn t see a single smile the whole time we were there The food arrived quickly - we had one of the set banquet options The food was nicely presented but nothing special it was decent enough but it could have been a standard takeaway The portions were a good size though and we certainly didn t leave hungry The location is very pleasant with views across the river although access to the restaurant is up a few flights of stairs  Our meal was very good value - 65 for 2 including beer and coffee 
neutral,Visited for first time and ordered starter olives and bread majority of olives tiny Main course Calzone whilst the content was good pastry was burnt round the edges and on the base When this was pointed out to the waiter his reply was I ll bring you a raw one next time  3pounds 50 corkage a bit steep particularly as bottle was a screwtop By the way debit or credit cards not accepted Considering this is supposedly an authentic Italian restaurant their performance leaves a lot to be desired 
neutral,Just back in our holiday cottage after a visit to River Cottage Canteen The rear dining hall was busy & noisy with one or two very young customers not being too happy as it was obviously way past their bedtime Service was efficient throughout the two hours we spent in the Canteen The menus are detailed on large blackboards hung on two of the walls Six starters and six main courses with no sign of chicken or beef anywhere to be seen  The food was fine - we opted for mussels and capaccio starters & for the mains - line caught grey mullet & a major salad comprising sugar snaps heritage tomatoes thyme baked ricotta & hazlenuts  Overall a satisfying experience with no frills but good value for money 
neutral, Good place for business lunch with wifi Limited 17 for 3 courses inc a glass of prosecco Not enough diners to create any ambience but the food was relatively tasty 
neutral, We visited the restaurant the food was good however one of our steaks was uncooked so had to send it back When the bill came there was a 8 service charge on it which was a ridiculously large amount We didn t think it was worth that much so asked for it to be removed and left a 3 tip ourselves The music was loud however I had no problem with that 
neutral,The venue was bright and something out of an ikea magazine The service can not be faulted The corn fed chicken will now that is heavenly coupled with the slightly spicy sauce The combination is great and the chicken wings five piece starter is great The pulled chicken broiche roll is just average which was disappointing as my rating would have been higher The sides have to be paid for separately and are on the pricey side Would I go again yes and with the chain possibly opening in shoreditch London  watch out chicken here I come Warning the sauce is fantastic and is just right 
neutral, Barnsley is a Cotswold gem of a village and the pub should be equally so However there is a Jekyll and Hyde quality about the place which ultimately disappoints  although you can t help but think that strip away the pretension and that gem is bursting to get out A fabulous summer s day and the courtyard garden just aches for customers to fill it over a classic country pub lunch And there the schizophrenia kicks in  1 2 out of 4 beer pumps out of action Not for the first time   so what I hear you ask does anybody seriously believe this a classic country pub 7 85 for a 250ml glass of Valdivieso merlot available on the high street so hardly unique left me wondering if I had been served by Dick Turpin Admittedly the follow up glass of chardonnay was very good value  The menu is not exactly the most adventurous you will ever come across but if this was a country pub there would be no complaints However either the food must be beyond reproach or there must be more of it to justify the prices charged Sadly the latter rules Rump steak was tasty but to quote my wife a struggle to get through  Chips were light and tasty and the sauce although thin was equally so But it s a steak dish and if the steak does not stack up then what is the point Plaice did not quite fall off the bone but it was at least fresh New potatoes and green beans qualified easily for a game of hide and seek The beurre noisette was all beurre which left a slick on the plate and palate It s not that this was a bad meal but rather that it could have beem so much better Instead there is an element of a place in which one must be seen but let s not focus on the food too much Totally overpriced for the quality of the cuisine and the portion sizes I am convinced it could be better if it got over itself and delivered a better dining experience for those who just want a great pub meal 
neutral, I ve driven past this place loads of times and have never been tempted to go in The outside decor and general look of the place is a bit off-putting Eventually my wife and I tried it this evening and it was average in every way possible I had a decent pint of beer but my wife s lager was served in a dirty glass and tasted vile The food was average though not pricey but the menu was very flowery for pub grub The bar staff were friendly but the waiting staff were abrupt verging on rude and weren t particularly good In all it was uninspired and other than popping in again for a drink maybe it isn t somewhere I would rush back to 
neutral, We had a great meal with freshly cooked food which was well presented  We returned a couple of weeks later to be told it was too late to eat in but we could have a takeaway The fish was freshly cooked but the chips were not fresh They refused to cook more chiips because they were about to close Surely the standard should be the same what ever time you arrive and order food 
neutral, Food wasnt all that found most of the food cold plus all the chef needs to put smile on the face as if like there happy to serve you was abit dissappointed with that plus once i got to the dinning floor was lost didnt no were to go to after 20second later waiter came up to me which felt abit embarassing while everyone looking at you when ur lost but i love the decor how it was done 
neutral, Service and staff are very good The food is not bad The ambience is lacklustre and the piped music persists so they as the place fills up it is difficult to converse 
neutral, Food was very nice but the restaurant was very loud and the atmosphere wasn t particularity suited to intimate dinner for a date 
neutral, My wife and I dined here to celebrate her birthday We had not eaten at Chiquito s for a few years and her choice for the day was a good Tex Mex   We remembered from years ago that this place was usually very busy so we were amazed to be the only customers there on a Friday lunchtime at 12 00 Service was quick very attentive and very friendly they even gave us a helium balloon when I mentioned the birthday - very sweet There was one small glitch my meal arrived with chips instead of the salad that I had ordered it was put right very quickly Maybe I should have done a Michael Winner and insisted that the order was written down instead of memorised  -  Drinks My wife had a Margharita and later a Long Island Ice Tea I sampled both While they both tasted nice it was pretty clear to us that the alcohol levels were minimal so 5 50 a pop was a little steep My lemonade was fine  Food The big loaded chili nachos to share starter was very nice not the best but certainly not the worst we ve had The toppings were good Sadly the portion size was relatively small One main courses was fajitas The super hot skillet on a wooden tray was impressive and even scarred the table underneath My wife liked them despite the flavours being a little bland The salsa and guacamole were unimpressive and not as good in our opinion as the shop-bought variety and again there was not a lot of them  I had chicken quesadillas thin strips that covered half the plate with salad Tasty but not a lot of it and very little chicken filling  Ambiance very quiet as we the only customers for half of our visit I saw what looked like ripped  patched bench seats Gents toilet hand soap dispenser did not dispense anything waiter said it may be stuck he will go fix    All in all we had a good time Maybe the portion size is Chiquitos well-intentioned effort to improve the health of the nation reduce alcohol levels and food waste etc Or it could be that they just want people to order more side dishes and deserts We ordered from the main menu not the lunch menu the lunch menu was cheaper with presumably even smaller portions  Considering everything above I can only justify three stars  My tips if you are hungry plan to order side dishes and or a dessert If you enjoy alcoholic drinks choose something that isn t mixed 
neutral, We ve been here a few times - when we ve been able to get a baby sitter It does a good job of serving thai food - the starter platter is excellent but the service can be very slow always really friendly though  
neutral, My wife and I are frequent visitors to this restaurant and on previous occasions have never been disappointed with the food or service in fact highly recommended this restaurant to many friends and work colleagues We visited the restaurant again very recently my wife chose the sea bass and King Prawns Chefs special which was delicious I ordered the chicken pate for starter which was nice and chose the BBQ Beef Burger for the main meal The burger was a cheap nasty frozen type which was tasteless the waitress did ask if everything was OK in which I did express my disappointed She did offer to replace the meal but I declined The waitress did go to speak to the chef returned and was full of apologies but no explanation as to why the meal was poor The food is generally very good and we never have qualms about paying the inflated prices and always left good tips But being charged 42 50 for a bar meal without ever receiving a small gesture or offer of a discount really disappointed me  I will sure to have the same cold attitude next time I pay the bill 
neutral, busy when we arrived  But I thought the atmosphere was quiet for the amount of people in there the choice on the menu was limited and not much choice if you don t like meat could do with more fish choices on the menu 
neutral, A great little braissere in the centre of Manchester serving very nice food at amazing prices Good wine list so an excellent inexpensive dining experience Staff young cheerful attentive and helpful 
neutral, Booked for a group of a dozen friends Problems began when they claimed that we had booked for a table of 20 when I had rung the day before to correct the number to 12 meaning we had to stand around waiting awkwardly whilst they changed over We were then left with our menus for a very long time before ordering and then again our starters took quite some time to arrive One friend had to repeatedly chase up his order of vegetarian momos By the time we had finished our starters and were waiting for our mains it was 18 30 having arrived at 5 The food itself was admittedly absolutely delicious but the whole process around actually getting it could have been improved in many ways and it left most people feeling pretty cranky especially as the slow service was putting many of us in risk of missing our train home None of these problems would have been huge in isolation but it added up to a pretty frustrating experience 
neutral, Love the decor and it s good to see something like this in Sunderland Food was average- I ve had better I ve had worse Overpriced for what it is but the decor and central location make up for that 
neutral,First impression was nice decor well presented surroundings  The staff were very friendly and efficient The menu was adequate if rather short on main courses and the chilly heat ratings need to be more accurate  I love Indian food and the Kharai Chicken 2 chilly rated barely reached a 1 for me compared to my local restaurant but quite nice none the less Have a good look at your bill too There were 11 in our party total cost 185 60 in BIG BOLD numbers at the bottom However on closer inspection the small print  just above showed the actual bill was 168 85 with a suggested service charge gratuity of 16 75 again in small print  Obviously its the big bold numbers that get your attention Now I dont mind giving a tip but I do object to being for want of a better word tricked into it A nice place but now where near the best place I ve eaten   sorry chaps 
neutral, Went here for a meal with my wife in early February It was quiet relaxed and we received a warm welcome The place had a nice ambience - really liked the decor inside Unfortunately the food did not quite deliver I had seafood linguine which while tasty was not plentiful by any means - very small portion  too small My wife had liver - she was told it would be pink which my wife said would be absolutely fine as this is how she likes it but they needn t have bothered as it turned up cremated  Both hungry after mains so we pigged out on three desserts between us which in fairness were delicious The staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable just let down by the kitchen 
neutral, We visit the Living Cafe Maidstone several times a week It is a great cafe with a lovely atmosphere At the weekend they have the B team serving They don t pay attention to the order spill the coffee when serving and don t apologise  wait for the coffee to get cold before bringing the cakes and then don t include the special offer when adding up the bill Shame because it is a really nice place during the week 
neutral, Eaten here few times not to bad but service is terrible they over book then can t handle it   Food ok burgers etc   would go again but when its quite 
neutral, Never been to a smokehouse before Giving an average rating until I visit another to compare the two Food was very reasonable though Left feeling very full 
neutral, I have been going to this pub for several years It provides basic food which is cheap and sometimes tasty The pub itself has TVs for watching Sky Sports so if you don t like football be careful when you visit The pub caters well for students and has a large outside seating area Not surprisingly many people sit outside to smoke - please look outside in the summer if you are with children and check on the number of smokers I will go there again for fish or a burger 
neutral, Went here on the Monday night half price day All well and good but the popadoms had to go back as they tasted like they were cooked in old oil After we sent the second lot back we gave up on them  The food was OK but not memorable The portions were on the small side I suppose half size on half price Monday I walked out feeling still hungry a first for me normally I am well stuffed after enjoying a curry  The owner was a nice guy and tried his best 10 10 for effort 
neutral, We had Christmas lunch The overall package was enjoyable largley because of the charming efficient staff and the general atmosphere The quality of the food was good except the Yorkshire puddings were over cooked burnt and as a hearty eater i would say the maincourse portions were modest The presentation was done with care and the service was friendly and efficient Over all we had a good time  However for somewhere of this potential quality charging these prices the gents loo is a joke 
neutral, This is a pleasant Italian restaurant not far from Hammersmith Broadway and not that far from the Olympia Exhibition Halls  This means that in the evenings the restaurant becomes very busy and unless you have pre-booked a table it may mean you joining a queue at the door  This in turn means there is a knock on effect or subconcious pressure for you to have your meal and drink and leave as soon as possible within reason I mean by this that you can enjoy a leisurely meal however once you have eaten and your plates are quite promptly cleared away your bill is soon on your table regardless of whether you have finished your glass of wine or bottle  Having said this I must say the staff are very pleasant and helpful and they do not ask you to pay the bill on the bills arrival but its arrival does make you feel your time is up and you should leave as soon as you can I can quite understand the reason but it does kind of take the edge off the visit  Regarding the menu it is of average Italian fare with the addition of a few dishes of the day on a board with nothing to really excite one You can enjoy a wide range of Pizzas Lasagne Risottos with a good selection of wines  Overall a pleasant dining experience and this was my second visit over two days on an Olympia exhibition stand but just average  I 
neutral, This little farmshop is in a great location sells good produce but the cafe which was once great has sadly gone downhill The coffee is still very good but the food is either good or terrible and the cakes are average but were once awesome when they made on site I don t know why it s dipped but I hope the standards rise again as I miss the the way it used to be 
neutral, A few days ago I visited this restaurant the food was of a high quality and the female members of staff were very attentive to the needs of the customers I have noticed that a member of staff no longer works at the restaurant from my long years in the catering trade goosd staff should be held on to If I had a criticism to make about this restaurant is about a male member of staff who seems to think that he owns the place I overheard him shouting at the staff in earshot of the customers this is very unprofessional When I owned my restaurant I would never embarass my staff in front of the customers 
neutral, We enjoyed the food on offer and the ales are nice - however the place although done very nicely is a little sterile for our liking worth a visit though 
neutral, Been a few times and the food is hit or miss with little middle ground  Chicken wings are a speciality and can ve delicious but I once received a bone dry overcooked portion with no sauce and the waiter practically called me a liar when I said they were  Beer atmosphere and decor are good though so generally ok 
neutral,We had the carvery with a choice of three meats Gammon beef & turkey The beef was too well done for my liking The price was reasonable  8 95 My daughter and granddaughter both ordered a crab salad which when arrived the crab was off If you can`t tell when food is off before sending it out is a bad sign 
neutral, My wife and I went here at the invitation of our Daughter and her family The place is typical Chain of Pubs with Restaurant  with divided areas to allow a little privacy All perfectly OK  Our service on this visit was slow and it was not particularly easy to pacify a small child who needed feeding The starters arrived and we had asked for the child s meal to be served with them OK again  Then the main courses arrived My ribeye steak was totally inedible Asked to provide it rare it was certainly overcooked but more importantly it was all gristle and fat When asked if the meal was satisfactory the waitress was advised of the my problem with this meal but also of some other problems It was probably the worst steak I had ever been served To her credit she advised that there were problems in the kitchen at the time and as a result we were not charged for my meal and we received an apology from the manager  I will always like to visit somewhere again if there has been such a problem as it is all too easy to be considered poor when it could be a one off therefore returning again with my family I have to include the fact that the meal on that occasion was perfectly OK and the rather sour note from the earlier visit was eliminated My concern was that they were aware of problems and felt that they could have been avoided  The restaurant is very popular and I have difficulty in giving an average score when in truth it was very poor on one visit but then very good on another 
neutral, Have been here a couple of times before going to the cinema Staff were friendly enough and the service was quick As with all Pizza Express branches they make a decent pizza and the prices are fine Nothing really to fault here but nothing amazing either So all in all a good meal at a decent price 
neutral, I joined a birthday celebration here in a party of seven The table wasn t ready when we arrived but only had to wait for a few minutes The staff were friendly and the good service lasted all night  However the food was average which was slightly disappointing I had the steamed pollock dumplings to start and the lamb shank for main course Both dishes were over powered by the high level of spices used and therefore lacked subtlety My fellow diners also thought there dishes were overpowered by the spices However the wine list was good and we enjoyed especially the Argentinian Merlot 2008 
neutral,Lovely new restaurant in Redditch a much needed variant on the usual selection of fast food and Indian places Food was great with large portion sizes Staff were friendly if not a bit nervous it was only their second day open though My only criticism was the 10 service charge added to the bill and then the card machine asking for a gratuity Foolishly I didn t spot the service charge had already been added to the bill don t know any places that still do this as it is frowned up on I then added a gratuity on the card machine as that s the norm Very cheeky indeed hence my reduced rating don t fall for it I won t not again anyway 
neutral, Good reviews so we thought this would be a cut above usual  Staff pleasant enough but the sauces one ordinary with no depth of flavour and the amount of meat per dish small Quite ok but relatively expensive for what we got Good if you cant be bothered to cook but not really a night out 
neutral, We have only ever dashed through St Pancras in the early morning on our way to the Eurostar so when we saw that a guided tour was available we signed up for it The tour was to start at 2 00pm so the four of us booked for lunch at 12 30 and met in the bar at 12 15 The bar is in a quite magnificently restored entrance hall next to the restaurant When you ask for the loo you find it is in a cupboard up two flights of stairs At 12 30 they called us in and led by the ma€¸tre d we filed past about 10 staff at various stations through the empty restaurant to our table Each of the staff in turn greeted us politely Nobody offered to take our coats though  it was drizzling outside so I gave my coat to the ma€¸tre d and was brought a cloak room ticket for it Later when we left my raincoat seemed to have turned into an umbrella as that is what I was offered with the counterpart to my ticket attached I rummaged through the coat rack to find my coat Nobody apologised We ordered a glass of wine each and explained that we needed to be out by 1 45 ie in an hour and 15 minutes time The wine came promptly and we were then left to look at the menu for 15 or 20 minutes and had to ask if we could please order Given our situation we only wanted a light meal One of us ordered the set two course meal and the rest just one of the starters each While our colleague was eating his first course the chef very kindly provided the rest of us each with a little pot of pumpkin soup to accompany him The food was excellent so was the wine  a gruner Veltliner  Getting the bill was a problem but after asking several of the staff who were flitting past we eventually got it at 1 50 p m and so reached our tour just in time  The bill came to 100 so you pay a high price for the opulent surroundings The food is of a very good quality Considering the number of staff about the service if friendly is poor 
neutral, If you are looking for a tasty hot Thai dish on a tight budget then this little place is just what you need 
neutral,We ve eaten at The Navigation a few time and the food is really good A friendly atmosphere and good beers I really like it a no frills pub grub place  We booked in at 6 30 as we were with elderly relatives who didnt want to be out all night Food order at 6 45 the starters took an hour to come The main course took another hour after that The lass behind the bar was friendly but run off her feet The deserts were finally served some time after 9 00 after having to go to the bar to order as the waitress didn t come back This was a Thursday evening and the pub certainly wasn t full As I say a shame we ve been put off But I really want to like it  
neutral, It s Weatherspoons You know what you get Decent ale but bar staff not very switched on knowledgeable Average ding food but value for money Venue fantastic great transformation of a local iconic site You pay your money and take your choice but don t complain as it s JDW  
neutral,It s over priced for what is essentially just a posh McDonald s The ingredients are better though which is clear from the taste but wasn t worth 15 for a burger and chips Ordering was difficult as it was very loud and the girl serving was a whisperer Very pleasant though  In conclusion it was very nice but over priced and the selection of soft drinks is unrivaled 
neutral, The Hoxton is all about the location where residents need to jostle for space amongst to the Shoreditch public This is the place for you if you re happy spending 15 minutes getting to the bar and competing for attention with legions of start-up types  I spent so much time trying to get some service in the vast public areas that a lively atmosphere quickly turned to frustration 
neutral,we visited Cote Reigate with two friends for the first time on Tuesday Lovely spacious layout friendly welcoming and efficient staff and majority of our food was very good with one exception My boeuf bourginonne was tough fatty and gristly and cooked in a very dull watery sauce - very poor  I didnt complain on the night as everything else was so good and I didnt want to spoil the whole evening but I would warn anyone eating there to avoid this dish  Shame as previous experiences of other Cote branches have been pretty decent and reliable 
neutral, This is typical of the modern take on Indian restaurants with very few of the classic trappings and decor - me I like the stereotype Indian feel of some restaurants - so this feels more like a canteen However the food is good and the service friendly 
neutral,This is a pub we have known for 40 plus years We ate here for lunch twice recently during a hot spell and despite being vey busy I could not fault the service or the friendliness of the staff The big problem was value or money The first time scampi and chips was ok but 10 plus for a smallish portion The second visit we had ham egg and chips Again 10 plus for the large portion which was ok but my wife had the 7 50 small portion A slice of ham a few chips and some salad bit of a rip off Walk on past the next door hotel which amazingly does not do lunches on a Monday or Tuesday  the place was heaving to a couple of small food outlets which both looked excellent value 
neutral, We tried the fixed price lunch and thought it was really good value Some of the chilli seasoning was perhaps a little heavy handed which tended to overpower the subtle flavour combinations of JGVs fusion cuisine  The overall ambiance did feel somewhat formulaic and the service perhaps over attentive But we would definitely return We do hope though that on our next visit they have not run out of Gewurztraminer 
neutral, I was told about the restaurant as the pub had won Pub of the Year 2013 and went for a pint of real ale and my colleague had a class of lemonade total 5  The pub opened at 6pm on a Monday and the restaurant opened at 6 30pm We next door for our meal and were the first people in the place We looked at the menu and the specials board and as we were both on fixed expenses just went for the mail meals I had the 9oz steak and my colleague chose the King Prawns and Linguine The steak was cooked perfect and was presented with the steak on top of the rest of the food I paid 24 for the steak and a pint of draught Becks My colleague paid 16 and had a glass of water Overall the food was very good the service was good and as a one off meal then it was good but cost of the food and drink would put me off from going back again 
neutral, Called at the Farmers tonight as like other reviewers we have always enjoyed the food here The fillet steak had by 2 of our party was very good as it should be there is not much anyone can do to spoil a good steak but the rest of the food was average As a restaurant it badly needs a refurbishment along with food spattered menus and dirty carpets it looks generally rundown It would have been impossible to walk in without booking a few years ago i hope things improve soon 
neutral,Our last visit was a lot better than a few months back food better and staff seem happier the fajitas are really good and so is the pulled pork chips will go again
neutral, We were encouraged to go to this restaurant because of the many great reviews it has and because we love Indian Asian food It definitely was different - there was no trace of the usual Western slant on curry however the result didn t live up to the marketing and reviews It would be wrong to say the food was bad because it wasn t but there again it wasn t pushing gastrominic experiences either This said we visited on a Tuesday evening and it was clearly a popular restaurant with locals Different and ok overall but wouldn t bother revisiting personally 
neutral, Service was good coffee I had was also good although cups have no handles which is weird for a hot drink  Rump steak I had was also not too bad but was over done when I asked for medium  Roast potatoes were soggy and gravy was just water which is never a good thing   
neutral, The food is what you would expect from a Pizza Express restaurant - good tasty However the service at this particular restaurant on our visit was poor It took the best part of 5 minutes for our group to be acknowledged by the manager on the front desk - he point blanked ignored us And our first round of drinks actually arrived AFTER we had finished our starters I could maybe begin to understand this if the restaurant was overly busy but it wasn t 
neutral,The refurb is excellent and a wonderful setting with friendly staff Sorry to say really average food though - needs to be addressed Could be so good 
neutral, Popped in for a few breakfasts this week not a bad little place to eat Plenty of seating and the staff were friendly too Quick hint though instead of following the signs to the restaurant which take you up an escalator and then down another one just walk to the opposite end of the store entrance through the doors and you re there 
neutral,St Mawes eateries were all pretty full apart from The View Our need for a couple of snacks and a kid s meal was adequately met My soup was very good but would have benefitted from a decent bread roll rather than slices of cheap bread and butter Service was with a smile but there was a bit of a language problem Decor is certainly minimalist 
neutral, We went to the Peacock and on being served at the bar were told that the kitchens were closed as they were having problems with the gas supply so no food We had specifically gone there to eat so were disappointed that there was nothing available so we had a drink and left 
neutral, Taken by friends as a birthday treat but I won t be going back I had the smoked mackerel starter which was a piece of mackerel plus pate When I asked for some toast with which to eat my pate I was brought a piece of white bread Which was odd but hey ho I followed with the sea bass served with a King Prawn risotto The sea bass was OK but the risotto was very gritty and unpleasant I finished with the cr€—me brulee which was served with     a piece of lightly toasted white bread I presume the chef or someone in the kitchen was taking the piss as I had asked for toast with my pate Your loss 
neutral, My partner and I were staying over night in Derby for the first time and leaving our hotel were wandering around looking for a bar when we stumbled across this place We popped in and had a decent glass of Merlot each Service was quick prices average However we both wondered why the place was so empty on a Saturday night something the staff seemed to be equally puzzled by judging by some conversations we overheard  We noticed that there was live music after 10 and so declining to look at a menu as we had already chosen to eat at an Indian restaurant we d passed around the corner we left Meal over an hour and half later we returned to find a few more people stood around the bar and a Gary Lineker look alike singing his heart out he was very good actually  The place looked good the toilets were very smart and clean and if full would I imagine be quite a buzzy place Obviously can t comment on the food but well worth a visit in our opinion for a glass of Merlot if nothing else  
neutral,Well I went in there last weekend with a vegan friend I m a Carnivor but I thought hey I ll give it a go The food was surprisingly nice and very filling  We wernt approached by anyone until 20 minutes after being in there after taking our order it took another 10 to just bring over the drinks 2 cans of lemonade  2 25 each  The meal came shorly after  2 Chilli Con Carnes my first vegetarian one very filling surprisingly tasty so was all round please with that Wouldn t go there if I was in a rush or on a budget O K - plenty of choice though 
neutral, The venue was super staff friendly but food was just mediocre I had the pork belly and whilst the meat was really lovely the rest of the dish wasnt up to scratch The sweet potatoe fries were dry and coleslaw didnt really fit My partner s ribs were well seasoned but again dry as were the fries  We really wanted this place to be great but it wasn t 
neutral, Hottest day of the year and staying in the nearby Britannia Hovel I really fancied a curry The restaurant was empty probably due to the fine weather I was on my own and was in and out in less than 45 minutes I had Chicken Shashlik with a Madras sauce Couldn t fault it overall was an OK experience 
neutral, A few of us ate here on Saturday night after randomly deciding to go here after yaldings xmas market We went in around 8 and were the only people there at the time Quite worrying for a Saturday night I must admit We all had a variety of different dishes and although they were nice enough I am afraid to say they did all taste very similar and fairly dull and boring By no means not edible but when you are paying good money I do expect a bit more from my food I would say only Slightly better than a ready meal from waitrose Maybe I have been spoilt by turmeric gold in tudely The waiters were very attentive and good but with so many empty tables I would expect that Overall I have had a lot better and won t be visiting again unfortunately 
neutral,Visited The 3 Greyhounds with a group of friends We had been advised that we couldn t pre-book a table so this meant a lengthy wait until well after lunch time This seems a bit crazy but guess means that pub doesn t lose your custom as you have no choice than to wait for a free table  or go elsewhere We had been told by our friends that had arranged to meet here that there were no children s high chairs available & to bring our own booster seat I didn t quite believe this as have NEVER been to a pub restaurant that doesn t have high chairs but I packed the booster seat just in case there had been mixed communication Sadly no mixed communication   there really were no high hairs  Strange that a pub stating at the door that children were welcome until 7pm 9pm in the beer garden didn t actually cater for them  I then needed to change my child s nappy so headed to the bar for the key to the disabled loo presuming that there would be a change table in there Wrong I had to just lie him on the floor Now I m not precious but come on  just go to IKEA & get a few high chairs & a cheap change station & mat This certainly wouldn t make me recommend the place to my friends with kids  or perhaps that s exactly what you want  a kid free pub  The food was nice It was very pricey for what I had but tasty The menu stated that my meal had a salad with new potatoes mixed in   but it had vegetable crisp things in instead Bizarre but nice I didn t question it until after I d eaten it so never mentioned anything to the staff Desserts were tasty but again pricey for want you got  Staff seemed nice enough and were polite 
neutral, I went with my partner for an evening meal and I have to say the night was mediocre at best The owner head waitress welcomed us politely if not a bit too forced friendliness The chef behind the bar mentioned towards his wine choice before we d even stepped through the door which could be worked on  17 for a bottle of wine I could get online at over half the price The food was enjoyable although most of it felt pre-made supermarket foods A good variety of veggie options which is good as my girlfriend doesn t eat meat Overall not a bad place to go for an evening meal if a little overpriced but not good if you want your occasion to feel special 
neutral,Took my mom out for dinner staff not friendly food o k will we be going back may be but not to soon chad 
neutral, There s nothing really wrong with this restaurant but there s nothing to rave about either   The food was adequate in terms of quality - I had crispy duck pancakes nicely presented and haddock chips & mushy peas enormous piece of fish though a little cold good chips and slightly odd tasting peas  My dining companion had a pork terrine deemed OK and a pork steak bit bland  We shared a cheescake which was alright though tasted a bit processed  All this with two glasses of wine came to about 50 - not bad Service was OKish - friendly though possibly slightly too fast In some ways they seem to be trying too hard here - aiming at almost fine dining but missing For example our wine arrived half way through the first course as did an amuse bouche   If I ended up eating here again when visiting Bamburgh I wouldn t be appalled but I think I d prefer to give somewhere else a try   
neutral,The White Horse is a nice traditional cosy pub in a great location Perfect for a pint after a long seaside walk  However for dinner it is average The menu is very extensive and quite appealing with a lot of seafood options but the food is served very quickly which may reflect the production line corner cutting approach They are obviously busy and popular so they ve set themselves up accordingly but at the expense of the quality preparation and presentation of the food - imho 
neutral, We had the fixed price menu Every dish was seriously delicious  we had the two fish dishes to start wow and forced ourselves to have desert as it was inlaced and they were both fantastic Service however very slow and hard to find when you wanted something which took the shine off the amazing quality of the dishes 
neutral, Red curry was tasty but consisted of just four slices of beef & 2 tomatoes in a sauce Mentioned this to helpful friendly waiter who came back and said there s nothing they can do as the portion sizes are laid down by Head Office Food was tasty but I dislike the poor value and having the size of my dinner decided by some corporate bean counter who s maximising profits For somewhere that markets itself as an authentic Thai experience - it wasn t it s just another chain 
neutral, This is a new restaurant located in the harbour of st Ives so a wonderful location Access for push chairs is difficult and wheelchairs impossible I would think There are tables on the balcony so it is even better on a lovely evening Inside it is well done out and there is a sense of space The menu is not extensive which in many ways is good because they could concentrate on quality The food is good lots of flavours and some interesting combinations There are some specials but they need to be written up somewhere so you can compare them to what is on the menu What let the experience down for me was the service They were efficient but not really friendly or confident They left you with a feeling of a quick in and out no frills eatery with slightly more expensive prices When the front of house is organised better then this will be much improved 
neutral,My wife eat here and the food was very ordinary and generally over cooked - i e soft vegetables There are much better places nearby with similar prices 
neutral, Went for a meal with family on a Friday teatime and basically apart from the service it the whole meal was disappointing The food was amateurish at best I had T-Bone steak which was under seasoned full of fat and tasted off Another member of the party had organic chicken and said the whole dish tasted overly sweet All in all a waste of time and money and sadly I won t be going back If you need to pick a Ricci s pick the tapas restaurant it s much better in all departments 
neutral, the restaurant looked impressive the sea food plate starter was unbelievable and the battered fish main course was so fresh you had to check for hooks  the cod melted in your mouth if not on your plate we just popped in to see our uncle Frankie who we have not seen for over 10yrs  who uses this restaurant all the time for meetings dates or just for a meal on his own  he has just moved from london and we now live in south wales so it nice to see him in this nice place he now calls home  the only problem and it is a problem is the toilets they are very poor and very small two people in the gents and the wc can t be used and the hand washing does not exist I only hope the staff don t use it  
neutral, I wouldn t say the food was bad it was just expensive for your standard chain food We decided we fancied something different after work and Chiquito was on the way home Being a Sunday night it was fairly empty but the that staff were friendly and efficient We had starters of potato skins and tacos which were fine but nothing special and our mains of Chilli beef tacos and enchiladas arrived about 2 minutes after our starters had been taken away again it was all right but nothing out of the ordinary With a 2 drinks and 1 side order the bill came to 47 with hindsight we could have gone to the Fountain at Clent of the Chequers at Cutnall Green and spent the same amount of money for something a whole lot better It was ok but we both left feeling that it should have been a whole lot better for the money 
neutral, It is a lot cheaper than paying to go to the top BUT a huge price for a drink and a look at the view For a one off visit it is pleasant to have a drink and look at the view but poor value for a glass of wine and a few nibbles I can t comment on the restaurant as we didn t eat there The view from the Gents is great as well 
neutral, The wife wanted to try a South Indian breakfast on our visit to Leicester recently So we got their for 10 30 when the place opened  The food was all veggie buffet eat as much as you want for 6 99 Not to my taste missed my fry up for breakfast but it was taste for a lunch would have been fine for me  
neutral, They are clearly doing a lot right here On a cold Tuesday evening in November the place was packed The pub is warm and welcoming the staff are friendly and helpful the real ale is good the d€÷cor standard gastropub is rural chic We had high hopes of an excellent evening when we booked in for dinner  But the food was a disappointment A smoked mackerel starter had small slivers of raw mackerel which were rubbery and tasted of nothing but raw mackerel A rib-eye steak was under seasoned and lacked flavour It was accompanied by a bizarre salad consisting mainly of raw grated red cabbage thinly sliced radish and peanuts completely devoid of any type of dressing - almost inedible My wife said her sea trout was nice and puddings were OK but we were expecting better However all the tables wee full so somebody must like the cuisine 
neutral,Lovely view with good beers and wines Food s not bad but then not wonderful or over generous Ok for the price Longest queue for the bar that I can remember Has been good other times If you fancy what amounts to a reasonable bar style meal with a great view over the Solent don t be out off Get the staff to bring drinks rather than waiting at the bar 
neutral, Chose the location due to local references while it will never be challenging for Rosettes the food was well cooked with good flavour portions if anything were over generous  Chef definitely has talent Good choice of wine Service was friendly and attentative making up for service staff s lack of dish knowledge  Will visit again after a positive first time 
neutral, Visited as a walk-in and were welcomed We asked if we could sample the mid-day menu and were graciously accommodated First course was very good we had terrine and melon but when the main course of cod and beef was served you could smell the cod as it was presented at the table THE FISH STANK The person who cooked it and the person who served it must have known It is unacceptable for food at a restaurant of this presumed quality to even leave the kitchen in this state it should have been binned there and then Having said that the replacement fish was very good I would not recommend this restaurant because you might not get the quality food that you might expect from a restaurant under the auspices of such a grand chef Wheelers of St James it certainly is not 
neutral, Whilst the food within Jamies was good it is over priced given its now more attuned to a typical chain restaurant The service wasn t amazing to say the least in fact our waitress was rude didn t smile and was rarely seen - in fact we had to go search for her   If you do attend make sure you don t eat in the basement as it lacks atmosphere 
neutral, We thought we knew Reina so went in for a very early evening meal The waiting was very efficient and attentive with us being the only people in it was immediate when needed but not pressured The Efes is still on draught and quickly ordered and delivered  But by then we realised that the menu had changed and was now as large as one in the average Indian A few of the mainly less interesting Turkish items remained however it has been padded out by many mainly Italian influenced dishes  The three of us enjoyed what we had the Honey goats cheese salad was excellent indeed the salads which came with the sides were also generous The pizzas were unusual suitably thin but lacking in tomato but acceptable My skewered lamb was of an acceptable standard But we missed the unusual extra that the Turkish Reina had  Sorry but York didn t need another Italian Med restaurant - indeed several larger ones have closed - one very recently I have always preferred the ambience of the Reina to other similar restaurants in York but I m not sure it is staying on our list of York restaurants 
neutral,We went there with some friends and their kids It was a Saturday night so probably not the best time for food which was ok but nothing special The experience was ruined by a group of men out to have fun which made the place very loud and not quite family friendly Ok place if you want to have drinks with friends 
neutral,My wife and I chose this restaurant before and had a good experience It is also walking distance from us so I was able to drink wine with the meal The place was quite busy mostly people of our age group - mid to late 60 and over  The service was paced just right and the food was as we remembered - very good but the whole experience fizzled out at ten o clock just as we were contemplating a coffee They started clearing-up and we just felt in the way - we didn t realise they closed at 10 o clock - on a Saturday night We won t be using this restaurant again and will take our business to restaurants elsewhere in our area even if we need to use taxis or I drive but don t drink alcohol We did leave a tip in recognition of the food but the restaurant I would not recommend unless this kind of service suits you 
neutral,Personally a bit disappointed as I was being told by my friends how good it is It was good but not to the extent of very good Might be a bit overhyped 
neutral, My son and I always like to call in to Cucina when we are in Morley as it has a nice welcoming appeal to it  I have never eaten on an evening only experiencing the business as a cafe serving morning tea and coffee with meals so I cannot comment on the evening meals  The restaurant can be busy on a Saturday morning Seats are available outside for which there are patio heaters for cold weather though you do run the risk of sitting next to someone who is outside to smoke with their food  The food in general is excellent It is well presented and cooked well The hot drinks are also very well produced a cappuccino always comes with a small side biscuit  The service is not so good Grumpy staff who give the impression that you are inconveniencing them is the norm The food usually arrives reasonably quickly but everybody from the person on the till to the waitress bringing the food looks unhappy to be there  The cost of the food is also not so good Tea and coffee is about what you would expect maybe a little higher but the food is ridiculous  3 25 for two slices of cheese on toast is very high unless somebody is personally mixing the curds and whey in the rear which I seriously doubt 
neutral, A brief review  Firstly - the place is spotless and inviting - really a great example of a warm and welcoming cafe - not a huge amount of space inside but more than enough  Staff were friendly and polite welcoming and seemed helpful  The food given the high ratings had a lot to live up to But I m afraid it didn t  Sausages and bacon were poor quality - perfectly acceptable but the bacon which WAS thickly cut was very tasteless and the sausages were catering quality at best One other review referenced this and it hasn t changed from then Ketchup and brown sauces despite being in premium-branded bottles I suspect were not the genuine thing and had been refilled - although of course this is only my impression and may be incorrect If this was correct however if prefer them to use a good quality own brand like an Aldi rather than the watery and sour tasting catering sauces  Overall - it is an ok place if you re hungry and in the vicinity - there are many more poorer alternatives but I think the overall rating for the place is incorrect in my opinion 
neutral, I find over the summer months we will be happy to walk across the road to the park and enjoy breakfast or a snack at this little cafe It can get quite busy when there are bands playing in the band stand but the staff are efficient and polite  It s a cafe rather than a restaurant and there are planty of food  menu choices to go with The owner also runs the cafe in All Saints in the middle of town 
neutral, We came for our special showtime evening on 4 June 2014 The staff were very good and plenty of them We enjoyed the show but our meal was not to the high standard we had come to expect from previous visits We found both the special showtime menu and the al la carte menu to not offer sufficient choice for us We do intend to come again but hope the menu choice will improve 
neutral, The restaurant is part of The Green House hotel so as residents and reading previous TripAdvisor reviews my wife and I booked up a table on Saturday evening We had a drink in the bar prior to going through we came out bang on time and waited to be seated The restaurant manager asked if we could wait for a few minutes as our table wasn t quite ready  no problem we ll wait in the bar come and get us when you re ready we said We went back in and as she said we d wait for a few minutes we chose not to order another drink 20 minutes later yes 20 minutes later as I contemplated having a word a member of staff walked over to the group of four next to us to take then in to the restaurant As they moved from their seats I overheard one of them say to the other that 45 minutes is a bit much I asked her to confirm what I d just heard when she did so I walked straight round to the guy on reception for assurance I wouldn t be waiting so long He was a nice enough fellow but as he was French his English is better than my French  he failed to grasp what I was talking about I walked back in to the bar and hoped we wouldn t be much longer Someone came for us immediately Drama over It appears they were short staffed On to the food  My wife s 3 courses were very good mine was undone by my Lamb Wellington being over cooked so a little tough  they also failed to supply a steak knife until I asked  the other courses were superb So in my mind if they said they were short staffed and asked us to wait with a drink on the house they could ve rescued the initial situation beforehand food wise 5 out of 6 courses being very good cannot be knocked On a fully staffed day the score would be a 4 if not a 5 
neutral, Don t get me wrong the otter is in a great location but for what you get food wise it was way too expensive I had the lamb shank Shepard pie my dad had the fish pie and my mum had the steak  We have had better steak from morrisons the lamb shank was bland and the fish pie was nothing special  Won t be returning 
neutral, We discovered Austen s by chance but once we saw it was authentic BBQ we couldn t miss out  Service The staff were nice but inexperienced on managing multiple tables so the wait time for bill paying and drinks reordering wasn t very prompt Also a lot of crashing and banging  Food Food was good but the coleslaw left little to the imagination  suggest seasoning to bring out more flavour and less cream  All the mains were great too but they came on a board which wasn t well presented considering the price of the bill total was pretty high  Atmosphere One thing that did really put us off though was that the music was incredibly loud for a lunchtime booking and the staff seemed to get carried away with it  So we couldn t talk and came out feeling shell shocked  Overall To put it bluntly - You re there to run a business that has repeat customers if you want loud music then do it at home but you should make that restaurant space the most enjoyable it can be for the customers not you guys  After food service when it s just bar service Sure put the music up but if I wanted to listen to music really loud I d go to a concert  I m at Austen s to eat and catch up with friends or family so just keep that in mind  Would come again if they got the overall atmosphere brushed up and brought down the prices a little 
neutral,The menu wasn t particularly exciting but my Gammon was fine However my wife chose the Lasagne and this appeared dried out as if it had been kept on a hot plate for some time 
neutral, Ate here with the wife on a Friday afternoon Pretty busy but good service Excellent range of beers and gins but a little overpriced Was also disappointed that they wouldn t serve Jaipur which they had on draft by the pint Both had the burger for dinner which was lovely Overall decent but you ve probably got better options around 
neutral, On a return visit in October 2016 learned the lead chef had left The meal was disappointing with the contents seeming to be of lower quality meat Something needs to be done to restore to the previous standard to induce customers to return 
neutral, My wife and I wanted to take her mother out for a meal at about 5 30pm on a Sunday We decided to eat at 1885 The Pub as my mother-in-law lives in Stainland within a stone s throw of the place  The pub itself was light and airy and the staff greeted us warmly and made us feel welcome The service was also very good but we were less impressed with the food The two ladies chose the roast beef dinner and were asked whether they would like their beef pink or well done they both chose to have it pink I chose from the specials board and opted for the venison goulash with herb dumplings The roast beef was served pink as requested and although it proved to be somewhat chewy there was plenty of it The two ladies described the Yorkshire pudding as being like cardboard and the cauliflower cheese was either overcooked or microwaved and looked less than appetizing The rest of the vegetables were served separately in a little pot and consisted of boiled potatoes roast potatoes carrot parsnip and broccoli  The venison goulash was not only served with dumplings but also with mashed potato I was also served with a pot of vegetables as described above so the meal was in danger of carbohydrate overload The main issue for me was the actual goulash I am not a fan of mustard at the best of times and the goulash contained so much of it that the overriding taste was one of bitterness This is my fortieth review on Trip Advisor and I am fortunate that I ve never had to give either a  poor  or a  terrible  review All my reviews have given a rating of  excellent  or  very good  with the exception of one restaurant which I could only rate as  average  Both the restaurant and the pub have received many excellent reviews from other diners so perhaps it s just a case of personal taste Nonetheless based upon my one visit I can only rate 1885 The Pub as average at best I didn t enjoy my meal so I have no intention of returning in the future 
neutral, Had lunch here with the family The setting is very distinctive The menu was limited but we all found something we liked and the food was well cooked and presented Service was smart and the staff were pleasant and helpful We had tried to have lunch earlier in the week but there were no places and so if you do want to eat here book in advance 
neutral, Paleo is a restaurant on Warwick street in Leamington near the heart of town It is ideally located when people want to organise a night out Parking is not too difficult with a car park within a couple of minutes walk The entrance and the initial look inside the restaurant is quite inviting and refreshing A modern style with a nice palette of red green the use of mirrors on one wall and a lot of wood furniture We were lucky to be there on a Tuesday when it was quite but I can easily imagine it becoming quite loud on busy evenings  The menu ended up disappointing me and my partner The concept of paleo would imply a few more noticeable changes to the regular items found on a gastropub menu but this was not the case here Actually there was nothing really different from any other mid range restaurant in the area We ordered the spicy pork balls for starters The meat was tender and very well cooked It had a hint of cumin but not much else The pickled onion was an interesting addition Our main courses were the salmon and the artichoke Unfortunately even though the salmon was cooked well the seeds or the matcha sauce that were promised were hardly present and had no flavour The biggest disappointment came from the use of pickled spaghetti vegetables which had no flavour but of the vinegar It would have been more paleo and tastier to use these vegetables but raw The artichoke did not taste like much either although the tomato ragu and the halloumi were nice Sides were recommended as just the main ingredient was provided with the main courses  For dessert we ordered a pecan pie which was acceptable not too sweet for a change but the crust was not very tasty The chocolate hazelnut tart was nice with a very interesting crust but the filling hardly tasted like hazelnut The hazelnut ice-cream was nice though Overall the food selection and quality was average and was it not for the use of more exotic spices seeds sauces I would have qualified it of being too expensive  The staff was young but very approachable and friendly The premises were clean and well kept the bathrooms had shared sinks very nice with a granite top and copper -colored taps  and were clean as well  I would not go there again as long as the menu is not improved and more original but this was not a disastrous experience either 
neutral, The restaurant was very busy but the initial greeting was poor as the layout was not great We were shown to our table where we were greated by a waiter who seemed to be in the wrong job - very poor customer service Food was OK but not great and we were not im pressed with the overall experience 
neutral, Had visited a few places on Smithdown and decided to give this place a go Staff were nice and food was good I think it s a little over priced for the quality of food and service but still enjoyed the meal 
neutral, Tried both Nude Sushi Box locations in Manchester Centre I prefer the other one For some reason this is not as good even though it s still okay 
neutral, This was our second visit to the Old Bear inn and after experiencing a fantastic meal the first time we knew we would enjoy it second time round Friendly staff great beer and lovely atmosphere It was clear they had a different chef this time as food was ok My steak was meant to be cooked medium but came out raw inside and stone cold in fact it wasn t cooked at all Waitress cleared both of our steaks to be done again and fair enough the chef came out and apologised Although the steaks still weren t cooked how we ordered Which is a shame The starters and desserts were good and good portions Would go back but maybe something easier to cook and not the steak 
neutral, We have been here twice  First time very nice service was very good we were served by Thai lady But the second time we went we were served by two English girls that really didn t give a dam about customer service  One of the waitresses told the other waitress to  CHUCK US over there in the corner  THAT WASN T THE BEST START FOR THE EVENING The Food was okay again The experience of the to english waitress have put us off going again Though the food is lovely 
neutral, We popped in here for a quick bite to eat and found the food to be nice very original place to eat Only downside was the portions weren t that big it was reasonably priced though 
neutral, Food is nice but often run out of one of the meats  I think the place needs brightening up Being a bit more modern 
neutral,I booked weeks in advance to ensure that our friends from Portsmouth and ourselves had a nice meal We arrived 5 mins early only to be told in an abrupt and scolding tone  your 5 mins early you know  Your tables not ready  We were eventually sat at two tables of different height that had been pulled together amateurish In short bad staff no wine list below average food  compared to Jamie s in York & Portsmouth  don t bother going do your self a favour and go anywhere else Become a gold card member it might improve the service   Make sure you tell them when you book I am a gold card member I did tell them when I booked You get more benefits from Tesco with their club card  Come on Jamie get to grips with this lot 
neutral,I know this is a volunteer team working for the RSPB And yes the shop is excellent for bird food gifts and the extensive range of books on bird issues But the modern charity has to offer more than a simple cafe when competing in the modern world The CCTV of the birds is nevertheless amazing  The Earl Grey Tea lacked the essential taste the bread was a bit on the hard side was it part toasted with the chicken sandwich and not much chicken and not that good  The side salad was rather old fashioned and poorly presented with cheap crisps added The coffee is OK 
neutral, We visited the Cow for four nights running It is very difficult to review as for three of the nights everything was fine i e food and servive but for one night it was abysmal service was non existent and the food was very small portion and poorly presented  Maybe it was the bosses night off So for three nights I would give it 5 stars and for one night one 
neutral, Got a takeaway delivered this evening Ordered chicken gang mussaman a curry that I am very familiar with from another thai restaurant and unfortunately it did not live up to expectation The curry was very heavy on the tomato flavour something which I am not used to in this curry Also had satay chicken average  dim sum bland  jasmine rice just plain boiled rice and what I thought was going to be pad thai but turned out to be just rice with meats in it On the whole rather disappointed In the future I ll stick to Yum Yum Thai and live without the delivery 
neutral,This place has great variety on their menu at a decent price Their staff are lovely but always seem to be busy and rushed off their feet So you might not get the attention to detail in customer service However it is still a place I highly recommend
neutral,The food was fantastic large filling portions But i was served a cracked and chipped glass waiters did not poor the drink for you either We were never asked if our meal was ok at any time Shame as this could be something special My partner asked for one of the sauces not to be added to her meal it still arrived with it on the plate 
neutral, We were advised of a 45-60 min wait for a table for 5 so went to the bar and had a few cocktails After 35 min we were presently surprised to be called for the table The food and drink were very nice not outstanding far from the best Hard Rock food I ve had over the years but more than acceptable The problem which has pretty much forced me to highly restrict what I can do for the rest of my trip was when it came to payment The server darted off very quickly with my card yes taking it away from the table and out of my sight  and after about 2 minutes of not knowing where the hell she was she came back to give the receipt but had to be asked for the card which she didn t have  After she darted off again I d already decided my only option was to cancel this card immediately on exit  This went on for a couple of minutes when she miraculously found the card in her servers pinny which she d checked half a dozen times in the search for this card  Seriously train your staff as this is not acceptable card handling etiquette in the UK in this modern age  Cards should NEVER leave the owners sight as advised in many police identity fraud prevention campaigns over the last couple of years  I m now left without my Visa for the rest of my trip even of she did off any kind of assurances I couldn t trust this unbelievable breach of etiquette  which now causes more than a few issues especially in regard to paying for our apartment 
neutral, We have been to Blackpool Sands beach so many times and have used the cafe on numerous occasions but have never yet visited the Restaurant On the last night of this year s trip to Devon we thought that we would treat ourselves to Supper on the Beach to round off a great week The food was perfectly acceptable fresh hot and the service was very quick However it was quite pricey for what it was with the best example being the Rosemary & Sea Salt Foccacia Bread was 6 99 for two very small pieces of bread  Having said that we would visit the restaurant again the next time we are on holiday in the area The view over the bay and the beach is excellent 
neutral,This former estate pub as become a Hungry Horse Pub Lovely Job inside I will start from the beginning We my wife and I walked in the front door and saw the large bar in front of us which at that pint did not appear to be maned I looked over yonder and there was a table in the far distant wall had a meeting of staff We found a table and sat down and browsed the menu my wife used the toilet and I did after also Still no staff I went out to check my car because we had left our dog in the car On my return the staff suddenly appeared from no where and I said there was no one here a while ago  a voice behind me said you only just walked in I was informed by him he was the manager this I found a little hard to believe because of his appearance I informed the staff it was my first visit to a Hungry Horse Pub they duly told me the procedure on ordering etc We ordered our food Surf and Turf Blue & a Baby Back Rib & Steak Medium also two large glasses of house Merlot When the food came out we were warned to be careful as the food and plates were very hot I am afraid to say that was not the case My steak was over cooked to medium and the Peas look as though they had been on the stove for an hour or more My wife s steak was cooked to well done And in both cases the Steak was tough The Scampi on my plate was very good and the Chicken also I found the staff very noisy behind the bar and the were laughing and giggling which made me a little uncomfortable I have to say The waitress Gemma that took my order was very nice and polite and did seem like she had a station behind the bar We also had a sweet I had the Trifle and my wife had the Knickerbocker Glory both were excellent Would I go again yes I would but the staff need to be shown some discipline About the toilets they looked spotlessly clean but they did smell strongly of urine this could be solved with a little Flower Disinfectant The bill came to 36 25
neutral, Worcester has several small Costas rather than one very large one This review is for the one located at The cross essentially the centre where most people walk either from the station or Crowngate or anywhere else  The restaurant is small though has very high celilings giving a good drinking eating experience and above average expectation of themed decor and is open longer hours than usual for high street coffee shops Queueing is normal much of the time except very early and late on However often runs out of popular food items at busier periods though still has the large comfy Costa seats Staff are generally friendly and efficient bringing hot food to the table without fuss It is let down by poor restroom facilities and people queuing there can be overfacing and detract from user experience if sitting nearby 
neutral,This place has a really nice feel Not what I expected to find in St Neots but we were glad we did The food was fresh and cooked over charcoal on an open BBQ  The staff seemed disappointed that we did not order starters and having seen the portions we could have had both a starter and main Often the food in these style of place are so huge you only need mains but this was well designed  The staff were friendly and polite  The only complaint I have is that the menu was at least 50 more expensive that the online menu This is a bit naughty and what looked good value was in fact quite expensive for what we had It was nice but did not justify the much larger bill than anticipated 
neutral, We had a meal at Mings on Friday evening Menu sounded good so we thought we would try it as we both like Asan food We had a table downstairs and whilst quite nice decor wasa devoid of any atmosphere We ordered a fairly pricey bottle of wine which was served by the waitress pouring 2 glasses on the empty table next to us without inviting us to taste Not a good start The starters arrived and they were very good especially the soft shell crab The main courses were good but nothing special We would not go again as it fell way below the wow factor 
neutral, Recently stayed in the splash landings hotel and decided to take a walk over to the crooked spoon for dinner The Pub looks amazing and is really well themed The greeting from the staff and the whole service throughout were amazing We were seated promptly and then went up to order no problem  Then when it came to the food it unfortunately went down hill The food took over 35 minutes to come out even though only 25 tables were full I had ordered the steak unfortunately when it came out it was cold and chips only warm was a real shame that the food didn t live up to the excellent service standards set out  Alice in the front of house team was amazing and stood out throughout and went above and beyond 
neutral,Came for the steak and ribs at the Fat Badger which normally does good food But the ribs were awful  Some of the worse tasting ones I had had in a restaurant  Definitely won t be getting them again unless they change their recipe  The steak my daughter had was good though And the wait staff are excellent  Thought a 1 80 for a small Sprite for my daughter was a bit excessive too 
neutral, I went here whilst on holiday in the area I was very pleased to find that they don t take bookings and on entering we were welcomed with a nice pub setting by the bar However we were promptly shown to an extension at the rear This was a large echo-ey room with a high ceiling reminding me of a caf€÷ at a garden centre This seems to be so that they can fit in more customers and capitalise off the label of it being Rick Stein s Pub  The food was all very delicious but as you would expect it was more expensive than a normal pub The staff were all nice if inattentive 
neutral, We visit Cedic several times and it s a typical Wetherspoons only problem is it s so cold they persist in temperature down at a very low level as a constant cold draught it s warmer outside 
neutral, We went for Sunday Lunch and had the three course set menu The starter of piquant sweet potato ravioli with fish I thought was superb but my other half was unimpressed The main course of roast beef and Yorkshire would have been better at the London Inn in Stamford for half the price The apple sorbet mouth cleanser was very nice The dessert was a stodgy tasteless bread and butter pudding and custard with a side of wonderful orange marmalade ice cream The ambience was good the service friendly the selection of drinks wide and high quality As you can tell a mixed experience You may well think it s worth one visit to say you ve been to the Pub of the Year buy for 35 head with drinks - plus the drive out to Clipsham - we ll probably decide to stay in Stamford next time 
neutral,I m nine years old and I went to this inn with my family We arrived at this place after not realy finding else and I wished that we didn t come The food was pretty average and we were the only people there so as you can guess the the atmosphere was terrible The only good thing was the waitress  I advise you don t go here
neutral, My major gripe with Ocean View was the location of our outside table It was encroaching on the walkway from inside the restaurant to out Consequently I spent a large amount of time tweaking the table position as various people brushed past me  It would be better if they removed a table from the row to generate more space  We found the service average but the negatives in the review are more than made up for by the exquisite views over looking the bay and cob  The food was of good quality with large portions and competitive pricing They serve a good range of drinks including local ale from the Town Mill micro brewery 
neutral, We d booked but waited quite a while for our table service was quite slow food was okay but nothing special Biggest issue is the noise - don t go there on a Saturday night if you want to hold a conversation with the people opposite 
neutral, Went for a meal at the Retreat for my Dad s 60th birthday Lovely setting and very stylish inside The drinks are very expensive 8 50 for a beer and a glass of wine is a bit steep As for the food I went with a black pudding and bacon starter which was actually very nice For the main I went with the seabass and wasn t really impressed I thought the fish was slightly rubbery and needed a bit more seasoning and the roasted veg was nothing to write home about I d have preferred a white wine sauce with baby or roasted potatoes and green beans The zig zags of chocolate sauce on the plate were also unnecessary and unappealing Having said all that my sister in law had the chicken risotto which was beautiful and the peppercorn sauce which came with the rest of the families steaks was to die for The staff were friendly and helpful especially the Chris Evans lookalike host owner who was very attentive and a good laugh I get the impression that the quality of the food on offer differs in terms of what you have and when you go which considering the expensive nature of the restaurant needs to improve Not too bad all in all but a bit more consitency is needed I think 
neutral,Good portions of filling food Good pit stop for us on a Saturday lunch time Friendly staff and good ale 
neutral, I visited this pub restaurant last Friday for a friend s birthday celebration We had a table for four which was tucked into a very dark corner with peeling paint on the walls One of the chairs was broken so I swapped it for another on an adjacent table  Service initially was very slow but picked up momentum to such a degree that as soon as our starters were removed the main course arrived which was too soon in our opinion However the waitress was very pleasant and friendly and the food was perfectly good pub- style food with very good portions Being close to Milton Keynes means that it is a fairly busy pub and a reservation is suggested at weekends 
neutral, Been here once before they are one of the only places in Newbiggin that are open so late The food is pretty average Prices are good Staff are friendly 
neutral, Called here for a typical English pub lunch with some first time in UK visitors from Taiwan Busy Saturday before Christmas so kept expectations to a sensible level Was helped to find a table for 4 in the Cabinet Room downstairs and all seemed fine Then however had to wait 15 minutes to even be able to order a drink and lunch Food when it came after a further 20 minutes was ok - nothing bad or good to say - just ok Service was not great at all - clearly not enough staff and the staff under pressure didn t cope brilliantly I really wish the management would not skimp on staff - I realise costs must be controlled but I wouldn t go back here because of the poor service 
neutral, This is my local Pizza express I have eaten at this chain for over 25 years and for over 5 years in the Marlow branch which is where I live  The food has always been consisantly good and so has the service We had gotten to know the management team and the staff as we come in so often but there has been a change of management and staff recently and boy does it show  We were in there last night for our ususal Thursday night treat and what a difference the staff make Before I go on our waiter was great friendly and attentive can t remember his name but he was a young guy with spikey hair and a cheeky smile and I have no gripe with his service  We waited about 45 minutes for our food to come and when it did arrive it was served by the assistant manager it was plonked down on the table with no appology for the wait and no would you like pepper or chili oil or another drink as our glasses were by now empty No smile and clearly no customer service skills Both our Pizzas were dry and no where near the usual standard that we have come to expect from pizza express We were so hungry that we just ate them Yes they would have offered to make them again but we had already waited 45 minutes for these dry offerings and would have passed out if we had had to wait any longer to eat so we just ate them  So management please take notice You need to sort your management out on the floor as this would never have happened with the last guy who has now gone to your Henley branch He ran the place like clockwork and his staff were the best Another suggestion is that in the Marlow branch you have a seating area to the rear Can this not be the family friendly seating area That way people who do not have children with them can eat in relative peace without screaming children shattering the ambience  I am not a moaner without good reason - see my last review for your restauraunt but I do expect good service and good food or I will just go else where that can offer me just that I hope that you guys have not gotten so big and corporate that you have forgotten your original values becuase that would be a shame  I hope you guys can sort this out as I have been a fan for so many years but Prezzo is looking the better option lately 
neutral, We recently walked toDartington via the riverside path from Totnes which was beautiful & strongly recommended-its not too arduous Feeling peckish we entered the Venus Cafe which we found to be clean & tastefully decorated in yellow & blue reflecting their beachside origins The cafe was not too busy and the staff pleasant and attentive and not facing the rigours of the summer season which has provoked some negative comments in the past Provenance is the watchword of this business witha total emphasis on organics Expect to pay premium pricing but is this justified From my experience I think not We paid just under 24 for 2 small Americanos 1 breakfast panini with french fries & some salad 1 beef sandwich with 3 potato wedges & some salad The big disappointment was the advertised horse radish with the beef was not available How could such a key condiment be unavailable The sandwich lacked the kick it needed and I found the beef mediocre My wife thought the panini ok but the sausage had a strange flavour These meals were a fairly typical choice for us but we have eaten better for much less elsewhere and was a reminder that organic does not necessarily equate to better flavour or quality Venus probably have a monopoly at most of their locations and whilst I admire their ethos & desire to take beachside catering to a higher level on the basis of my Dartington experience I will probably give them a miss in future 
neutral,A group of seven of us called in for coffee I had an Americano and the coffee was good and we were well served but I would have preferred a larger cup for 2 40 
neutral, Well what can you say Its another Wetherspoons with all the traits that go with it day time drinkers youngsters getting lashed etc etc  Good selection of beers at good prices staff were good 
neutral, ended up here after arranging to meet friends at old orleans which was boarded up just my luck twice in two days went to a restuarant that was no more but thats croydon fast turn around anyway food was ok and so was the price pretty much what you d expect from this sort of themed chain toilets not great though 
neutral, Port Solent is the place where my partner and I had our first date so we like to return here every so often On Friday the 27 02 15 we decided to drive to Port Solent and have something to eat we looked at some of the yachts including the lively lady before deciding to have a pub lunch in the Sir Alec Rose which is a Weatherspoons public house As it was a Friday we chose to have fish which comes with either a soft drink or for a pound more an alcoholic one  Because I enjoy a decent cask Ale I decided to try Harpoon which I have never tried before whilst my partner drank lemonade and lime Its nice looking at the yachts whilst dining and although like any other Weatherspoons house you know what you are getting regarding value for money its a pleasure coming to Port Solent to enjoy the scenery 
neutral, my wife and I often use this restaurant for spur of moment times as you dont have to book in advance we have never had bad meal So saying we do try to go at quiet times I like the steaks & gammons always good 
neutral,Great food if you need to something quickly and want more than the normal soggy sandwich Food is freshly prepared and tastes great It s a little pricey but worth it 
neutral, We use this place on a regular basis gets incredibly busy and noisy if you want a quiet place to talk this isn t it Often have long queues for a table but well worth the wait Great lamb chops really good Chicken Biriani nan breads are also good If you can handle the wait and the noise a great place to eat 
neutral, My Wife and I decided to have lunch out last Friday whilst looking after our grandson 18 weeks old The choice was the Crown at Penn or the Plough and we decided on the Plough as we like Italian food and knew there would be space for a pushchair However we regretted our choice as soon as the food arrived My Wife chose a mushroom pizza which wasn t anything special and I had gnocchi a particular favourite of mine but when it arrived although reasonably tasty was what could only be described as a child s portion for the sum of 13  Anticipating a small wait we were attracted to the Homemade bread olive oil and balsamic vinegar to share as a starter but were speechless when it arrived - basically 4 small slices of panini style bread and oil All for 4 75p I did comment on the starter when paying the bill and asked if all was ok with the meal but received little apology We have eaten here before on a few occasions and have to say had good and bad meals but were prepared to give it another chance It will be sometime before we return 
neutral, Had heard good things about this pub however wasn t that impressed with the grub ok but nothing special  Pub Quiz is good though  
neutral, My daughters and I had a meal at Imli for two of us the food was okay although my Biryani was a little bland One of my daughters had a big problem She found a total of three blond hairs in her curry At first she thought that it may be her own hair but they were bottle blond my daughters is darker When we drew the attention of the waiter to the problem he changed the meal without a second thought but the manager or owner didn t appear to have been told  A nice restaurant but I would always be checking my food for unwanted extras  
neutral,We have been regular visitors to this restaurant in Nottingham and have always been very pleased with both the service and food However our last visit was a little disappointing We have selected the shared starter containing a selection of items on many of our visits This shared starter has now changed the beef ribs and the prawns in filo pastry have been replaced by chicken wings and chicken again in the filo pastry This starter now consists mainly of chicken and for a cost of 15 is not worth the money It felt like the restaurant had changed owners because the food for the starter and the service had changed for the worst The Tom Yum and Tom Kai soups were very good and all of the mains on the set menu A were fine Will we return maybe we may give this restaurant one more try before we cross it of our list Cutting back and trying to save money on the shared starter will reflect on your customer s experience return to the standard you used to be 
neutral, We came here by chance after a visit to the ski slope in Hemel Hempstead I was glad that we did as the food was very flavorful I would definitely recommend you visit if you are in the area but be warned that their portions are very small for example we ordered smoky beef briskets which even though were very nice cost 5 25 for 5 small slivers of beef 
neutral, We went for dinner to this elegant and beautiful restaurant Our expectations for this place were quite high and in my opinon the experience was a little bit dissapointing The service was very nice and attentive but for me the food was just average The starter was an antipasto with cheese and meat very bland Our main courses were a mediocre grilled swordfish and a ryb eye steak well cooked but lacked of the wow factor To be honest I can ‹t understand why those main courses were in the specialties of the menu maybe we chose wrongly To be fair the value for money is ok and not pricey if you compare with other restaurants in town 
neutral, This place could be much better than it is It s very lacklustre You can see the kitchen which I alway like but it made me nervous as they just didn t seem that competent The menu isn t very varied so we ordered fish and chips and the fish was alright but very standard and the chips were not nice at all They tasted like cheap frozen chips  My friend had a pie of the day and really liked it We thought we would have pudding and out of five options two weren t even available and this was lunchtime The sticky toffee pudding looked nice but was very dry it s something that really should be you know sticky  It really seems odd to me that a place would even bother being this average in that area where there are so many restaurants and cafes The chains nearby are much better I like the Strada over by HMS Belfast with the great views go there instead 
neutral,The Floating Bridge Inn is located right opposite the ferry known as the floating road as the ferry is actually classed as a road  The Inn offers outside seating with excellent views on a dry sunny and warm day It is olde worlde and has a good menu but the best is locally caught fish Small medium and large Small with chips and mushy peas at 6 00 is truly great value and served quickly and nice and hot Staff were friendly and are well used to visitors with an apetite 
neutral, The place was quiet at tea time on a Saturday normally I would worry as this tends to be a sign of a bad place but my partner wanted to go in  We went in and most of the staff seemed to be huddled in the top corner of the eatery sitting down and chatting  The place lacked the experience I have had in other towns cities  The service to take the order was slow but the food was there very quickly  Again not a good sign but the food was ok  nothing special  I would only attend this particular one if I had a good enough voucher to get me in  
neutral, The place is clearly trying to do great things offering a special service and working with local suppliers However I had a sandwich served with crisps the bread was not fresh and the crisps had a distinct touch of staleness 
neutral, Not that this matters to me but there were no vego options This upset the missus a little bit My starter was the finest little dish I can ever remember eating in a pub Slow cooked rabbit that had been stripped from the bone cubes of confit potato bound in a rabbit stock and mustard butter emulsion Peaks of acidity from finely jullienne strips of granny smith accompanied with a glazed rabbit leg peking style Absolutely fabulous That was it however Cant remember what the missus had it was rather lack luster She had beef for main which was too rich and I had pork for main which was just average plate of fat Didnt bother with dessert Hard one to call really 
neutral, It depended what you ordered as to the level if enjoyment The fish and chips and the steak were winners and cannot be faulted The haggis and scallops starter was just not very tasty and endured rather than enjoyed The smoked haddock risotto was heavy and far too salty which meant the meal stayed with you for some time not in a good way  I think the chefs need to do more tasting as they go not just serving up as it really is just a fine tuning issue  Wine was good and service excellent but as a regular Loch Fyne visitor both here and elsewhere in the country it was disappointing tonight 
neutral, Nothing special but reasonable food and as much as you can eat vegetables 
neutral, Cool place top beer decent food except cooked a bit well done good service spoilt by kitchen spreading margarine on rolls brioche which overwhelmed any smoky flavour so it would be more accurately called  Samuel Jones Margarine & Ale House   
neutral, Late Sunday lunch 3pm waited 30 minutes for a table I ordered Beef roast the lady ordered a well-done burger as you need to write down what you want I d guess that would left little room for error - How wrong The burger was cooked very rare and had to be sent back I can only think they were that busy they were in a race to get food out the kitchen as soon as possible as the table next to us had to send back two meals as also undercooked one of which was fish for a child In a stroke of irony my beef was overcooked it was to the point of being tough unfortunately that then turned the lunch into a solo dining experience as by the time they d brought the second meal out i d finished mine so my dining partner and i pretty much watched each other eat I had to ask for extra gravy twice and it still didn t turn up The starter was a selection of Italian meats and bread  12 one type of bread isn t a selection nor was it Italian or served with any butter or even oil and vinegar - One starter two mains one drink each - 55 far too expensive for very average food and lackluster service I don t mind paying 50 for a decent lunch but i d expect the little touches like having water or bread brought to the table without being asked and food that was cooked as requested The staff were seating people with the previous diners plates still on the table Personally i d rather wait another two minutes and have a clean table When it came to paying I was asked how it was I confirmed disappointing reiterated that we d sent back one meal but nothing taken off the bill as no-one with the authority to do so was available Dont have someone manning the till if they dont have the authority to do something about a compliant Very disappointed as reviews i d read were very good and i really did want it to be nice it just wasn t 
neutral, I was taken here by associates for breakfast and it says what it does a very nice cafe but thats it would eat here again for breakfast 
neutral, Lunchtime visit As has been said in other reviews you know what to expect here We made use of the 3 course lunch deal for 15 95 per person and this is undoubtably good value The food was fresh and fair quality There were two drawbacks 1 It wasn t busy and whoever drew up the rota s got it wrong The waiting staff were good but only one chef who was working his socks off but we still had a 45 min wait for mains too slow 2 Why do people bring their over indulged and ill disciplined children out and spoil the experience for others Zizzi is a fine reasonable choice better quality probably than its competitors and better value The location in Newark is good but pick your time to go and make sure there is more than one chef working  
neutral,Been twice before and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience Went with a large group this time and felt as if we were too much trouble - food was ok but service and overall attention seemed lacking compared to last time  Was ok but wont be rushing back
neutral,had sunday lunch at the bull hotel food was very good but the waitress was so miserable cutlery just dropped on the table no serviettes was never asked if everything was ok when we went to pay not a thank you or good bye not surprised we were the only ones in there 
neutral, Had a half-decent meal here Reasonable prices and good service No reason to complain about anything It was very empty which might not be unusual for a Tuesday evening but the indian further down the road was so full they couldn t fit me in for at least 3 hours 
neutral, La Cloche is very much an upmarket Cafe Rouge but with an all star cast of French family owner chef and waiting staff - either that or they are excellent at mimicking Gallic natives The table d hote lunch menu at 12 95 for two courses has a modest choice of dishes but we understand that the a la carte menu in the evening is much broader with plenty of choice  Our starter dish for the lunch comprised wedges of marinated salmon - gravadlax  - on a bed of new potato A refreshing beginning to the meal Afterwards we took the minute steak with pommes frits The beef was very good and cooked to perfection Tarte tatin was not on the lunch menu but the chef happily found a portions from the evening menu  For me there were too many foreign wines on the list to the extent that finding a decent wine of French origin was not easy but the Patron was on-hand for sensible advice The Bergerac was fruity and a tad expensive at 30 but the Gaillac Cuvee des Drilles was an earthy libation at a modest 24  Paper napkins did not go down well although laundry costs for linen are not that expensive No doubt the evening service with the a la carte menu would have banished the use of paper napkins All in all a reasonable lunch that will encourage us to take dinner at La Cloche later on 
neutral, I think the title says it all really nice coffee and cake The staff are all very friendly BUT and I am afraid it is a very big BUT the service is agony I have now been twice - early so there wasnt a massive crowd but it really has put me off If you could give 1 2 stars they would have got 2 1 2 points rather than 3 A real shame 
neutral, After deciding to try this place again recently with a friend I can maintain that the service here is very off-putting both times I ve visited waiters have been very blunt and it creates a bit of an awkward atmosphere During my most recent visit my friend asked the waiter which red wine he would recommend to which he replied I don t know and then told her which one was the cheapest Not exactly what we d asked for and a little insulting  The pizzas and pasta dishes are always good and food is great value for money so it wasn t a poor visit but I will always choose their sister restaurant Pinocchio over Donatello due to the more intimate and friendly atmosphere 
neutral, The fillet following a second trip to the kitchen when it returned cooked to my original asking was delicious However it returned with a corn on the cob possitively chilled to the point of inedible I didnt bother to eat it nor complain as my wife  whose Sirloin was delivered at the same time as the first visit of the Fillet was part way through her meal Ambiance was lacking with lighting rather stark and a table where we were on view to a punter sat at the bar in the pub section Poor would be too harsh but would have been my rating if it was just me 
neutral, I had a meal hear and I have to say despite the good reviews the pizza was a crushing disappointment It looked a little like it was bought from the asda across the road Perfectly round very small and not very authentic looking Having said that it tasted fine  Otherwise The service was good staff polite and house red drinkable  If you want good Italian pizza in Kingston go to al fornos That place is far better 
neutral,we booked dinner at Swinton Park s Samual s restaurant for a special occasion on a Sunday evening we arrived at the hotel and when driving into the grounds the impression of the hotels was stunning and on arrival we where warmly greeted by professional very friendly staff and shown to the drawing room This was warm and cosy as it always is we ordered drinks to start with before we sat to look at the menus We do appreciate that this is a country estate and we do expect that a selection of game would be on the menu but there was only a selection of game on both the starters and mains selection a variety of different fish This makes it rather difficult for someone who is not particularly fond of game and not really a fish eater When speaking to the staff the Chef agreed to provide a turkey diner as an option which we thought was fine We where shown to the restaurant and our starters arrived firstly my wife started was a green salad a mixture of salad with cheese curd and a dressing with less than the palm of your had of salad on the plate My starter was wood pigeon and again well cooked but so small it resembled 2 cloves of garlic with a small amount of green and a dressing to the mains i had ordered the halibut which arrived with a piece of halibut about 40mm by 70mm in size on a slice of Cauliflower a small spoon of pureed veg and again a dressing of sorts My wife faired somewhat better with her turkey dinner which had 3 slices of turkey which was very dry 2 Brussel sprouts 1 carrot a portion of layered potato and a small amount of gravy over all my two course would not have amounted to a starter sized portion if both had been combined There was no option for extra vegetables and all for over 55 we have mailed the hotel with no response but as they are a restaurant they should cater to cover members of the public who firstly are not game eaters and not particularly fish eater chicken or lamb would have been an ideal inclusion but not available we asked for the bill and left without a sweet or coffee and called into the coop in Masham to buy some thing to cook when we arrived home we have on many occasions eaten at Swinton Park but not again at this standard 
neutral, On Sunday night the restaurant was very popular and we were lucky to get a table The service was good and the staff were pleasant but the food was slightly bland The slices of chili were not hot and I could not taste any garlic If it is a spicy pizza it needs to be spicy and taste of garlic  I have had really good pizzas at Francesca s but this time it was okay 
neutral, Ate at this restaurant for the first time having enjoyed a decent coffee there previously Service was just about adequate rather than attentive and the waiting staff did not notice that my main course arrived without the potatoes it should have had After I pointed out the omission it took a further 7 minutes for the missing potatoes to arrive and there was no apology offered My companion s steak was tasty but tough and really did not live up to the description ribeye steak It was more like a budget supermarket cut Despite those problems I would say that we enjoyed the meal overall being fairly easy to please and in terms of flavours offer no criticism at all The atmosphere was busy and cheerful but the noise levels bouncing off the bare walls made conversation difficult and became quite wearisome after an hour or so Nevertheless I will probably give the venue another chance in the future but not if it I am with someone I need to talk to quietly or to endear myself to Cost-wise I would say slightly overpriced 
neutral,Stopped off for a lunchtime time snack which was served by pleasant staff in a characterful bar with a roaring log fire Thought the background music an unnecessary intrusion but would visit and eat more extensively when returning to the area 
neutral, Have been to Ryans many times it represents basic but good value for money food in the town centre they serve a good pint of Guiness too Well worth another visit 
neutral, We called in on our way back to the hotel for a quick drink on Saturday night As soon as we walked in we realised its not very Irish It has an Irish theme but feels like a chain of pubs The drinks were reasonably priced for a City centre and was pretty much what you would expect of a pub chain but didnt make you feel like you were in Ireland 
neutral, Down in Leeds for a concert so had a meal out and decided to try Souvlaki The staff were nice & friendly and we opted for the two course and glass of wine for 15 95 per head I tried fish cake never had a fish cake served in batter but it was fine my wife opted for the meatballs which came to the table tepid We spoke to the staff and a fresh meal was offered but a quick zap in the micro was sufficient for our needs It was a bit dry but hey ho onto the main I again tried fish which was lovely but my wife had the chicken with black olives and rice Unfortunately the rice was embellished with bits of olives throughout which was not to her taste We mentioned this to the staff and 10 was taken off which was a good gesture would we return probably not 
neutral, We must have caught them on a bad night based on the other reviews We booked a table and arrived 10-15 minutes early We were asked to sit in the bar area which is fine but not once in the 15 minutes we waited were we asked for a drink nor were we provided with any menus  We were shown to our table but still not provided with menus The staff then asked if we were ready to order   Before the food arrived the table to the right of us complained that the food was cold and the table to the left complained that their chicken starter was raw They argued with the staff for a while as they didn t want their main course but were eventually persuaded to have it  We waited a little longer than we wanted for the food but in fairness the food was good We did however order another round of drinks which never arrived   The staff were friendly enough but the service overall was poor which let the whole evening down  I personally will not be going back in a hurry but if they get the service right it will be a success 
neutral,We ordered a take away The order was prompt The Thai green curry Thai calamari roasted duck curry were all good Only problem is that the restaurant forgot one dish They offered a refund It was just a shame that there wasn t enough food for everyone which made it a bit disappointing 
neutral, The food is good - aromatic flavours well presented The service was hit and miss - easy to attract the attention of staff but after the main course they seemed to lose interest Quite expensive - and service charge already added on bill although which is unusual for Rochester Hopefully the service will improve and then I would recommend the restaurant- at the moment I would say try it and decide for yourself 
neutral, Ordered King Scallops cooked in a garlic chilli and white wine sauce for starters having ordered this on a previous visit however when it arrived it tasted of just scallops and chilli I had to double check with the waiter that there should be garlic in this starter and he said sorry due to the rush the chef left it out so I never got my garlic kick apart from that the rest of the meal was very nice Great atmospheres 
neutral, I haven t been there for a few years because it s on a steep hill which is difficult to climb if you re crippled as I am  I remember it as a very attractive pub with a superb uninterrupted view of the sea - great place to visit on a summer day  The food was average in the old days - no idea what it s like now However when John Bourne was the publican the beer was always kept beautifully 
neutral, We stopped off here on the way home from Hastings and were very disappointed I had a veggie burger with chips and a tea which was 9 20 which I found extortionate for a roadside cafe The portions are average and the service is definitely without a smile The young lady at the counter had a scowl on her face the whole time she served us and even moaned to the chef in front of us that she wasn t getting any tips Surely she should realise that if she gave good service she would get good tips  The chef that brought the food was a tad cheerier but all in all it felt like we were an inconvenience for being there They have a garden area which is empty as they don t allow dogs due to hygiene issues so we had to sit with our dog and toddler outside the front of the cafe We also noticed that not many of the bikers were eating there so perhaps they have found it too expensive All in all it is very doubtful that we will return which is a shame considering we live just down the road and could be regulars 
neutral, We have been to numerous Weatherspoon establishments in the past and have usually been fairly impressed with the food served However on this occasion I found the food to be average at best It was not particularly hot and the service was not particularly quick 
neutral, I went to the cafe again the other day for a quick noodle soup with my girlfriend The broth tasted nice and must have been cooking for a good while as the menu states The rest of the soup was really poor though - undercooked cheap noodles and definitely not fresh wonton The service was also very mediocre surly welcome uninterested service no goodbye acknowledgment at the end of the meal This is the second time i ve been to the cafe and while i know a lot of people really like this place i just don t know what the all the fuss is about It s not that cheap either there are much cheaper asian restaurants in this part of the world that serve far better quality cuisine  Not sure if i ll return 
neutral, We visited on a Monday lunchtime and the restaurant was empty so lacked any sort of atmosphere A waiter greeted us showed us to our seats and then rushed the explanation and what we had to do to order - they then disappeared not to be seen again You had to order and pay at the counter so it s semi-waiter service and like Nando s feels like an upmarket fast food restaurant We both ordered a Taxi burger and onions rings which tasted great but if we didn t have a taste card I would question the value for money Some nice touches include free monkey nuts and free refills on certain soft drinks But unless they have an offer on I don t think I would rush back to pay full price 
neutral,We booked Sutton Hall for a celebration meal on the strength of its menu and location Our main course took a very long time to arrive after our OK starters Three of us had what sounded like the most adventurous dish on the menu These three dishes arrived looking as if they had been under a heat lamp for twenty minutes and were consequently very dry even chip shops manage a moist suet pudding  In a large room we only ever saw one waiter No excuse for sending out food like that-we will not be returning 
neutral, Lovely location for this cafe but sadly the prices are dropping to the pocket for even a basic nibble I paid 4 50 for a small pastie with no side salad or chips or gravy sorry but that s just a rip off  3 50 for a slice of cake yes Victoria sponge  Sorry I will be taking a picnic next time I go I advise you to do the same 
neutral, Have tried this restaurant a couple of times now and really wanted to like it and to be fair did not think it was awful BUT found it to be a bit pricey for what it was and the menu was not to our taste The food was just average nothing special and on both occasions found all the food to be completely overwhelmed with garlic Some may like that but I prefer to taste all sorts of tastes I ordered a camembert which I shared for a starter and a piece of salmon with crispy noodles as a main neither of which mentioned garlic in the description and both of which tasted of nothing else I could not taste the salmon at all and my breath smelt so bad the next day not just a bit either it was awful My husband had the steak which was ok but under cooked to what was asked and as mentioned on other reviews frozen chips a peppercorn sauce was ordered and it took your breath away it was so strong Other members of our party had steak one had pork belly with sweet potato and mustard mash and one had liver and again nothing was better than average Average food is fine for average prices but for two courses with a bottle of wine per couple it cost around 65 per couple which I think is above average The service was good although the plates were cold and the portions were average although we did have to ask for more vegetables which arrived quickly I personally would have liked to see more fish options but it is not unusual for there not to be So to round up all in all an average night for a not so average price 
neutral, We had moored our boat close by on a Saturday evening and decided to give the Waters Edge a try as it had recently been refurbished The evening started well as we enjoyed a pre dinner drink at the bar and were then shown to our table We were both impressed with our starters but the problem came with my wife s main course fish dish The centre of the fish was still cool and wet being slightly undercooked We complained to the waitress who apologised and sent for the owner The owner arrived in a clearly annoyed state and in a brusque manner insisted that the fish was cooked perfectly correctly hadn t been frozen and offered to show us an invoice to prove the fish was fresh that day We found the owners attitude offensive unprofessional and not in keeping with customer care values After all all that was required was for the fish to be taken back to the kitchen and cooked for a while longer My wife was unable to eat the meal we paid the bill got tired of waiting for the change and left 
neutral, Wasn t bad but overpriced for what it was and we were on a groupon  Rubbish selection for vegetarians Hate the font on the sign  
neutral, Pleasant staff and surroundings nothing outstanding but nothing to complain about As we only had drinks we cannot comment on food 
neutral,We visited bella italia on a whim after walking into town from the train station We had large bags to take in and they seated us in a very awkward position where our bags would be in the way  It took a while to be served but when the food came it was lovely and really enjoyable the puddings were lovely too I recommend the cookie pudding  The staff seemed rushed off their feet and it was a struggle to request another drink when you had finished your last one They also forgot to give us cutlery for our puddings and it was difficult trying to get their attention to ask for some  The food was lovely the service was average and the price was expensive for what you got - especially for the drinks  Will go again for the food but may try another one of the chain in another city due to the service 
neutral, Stayed at the cotton arms camp site for 3 nights Good Location Food Beer Bad  1-Failed to tell us we needed tokens for the shower so couldn t shower the first morning In general facilities are very basic and quite far from most camping spots  2-Hard to book emailed 3 times and had to call twice  3-Staff member rude when asking us not to stand by the fire because we were blocking the heat  we had just come out of the rain and wanted a drink and to warm up A smile and some manners go a long way So we left and went to the Dusty Miller opposite for dinner which was excellent service and food 
neutral, I came in my for my meal around half past 8 on a Friday the restaurant was pretty busy I was seated promptly and given a menu the waiter took my order and brought me a glass of water the service ended there  Before eating at Giraffe I wondered whether I would have enough time to do so however the note on their menu stating that they endeavour to serve food within 15 minutes assured me that it would be ok I didn t eat until after 9 o clock I waited somewhere around 35 minutes for my food Luckily I wasn t in a rush but if I had been I would have had to have walked out  The food was actually quite tasty I had the salmon with wasabi rice 
neutral, A disappointing experience from start to end  I booked a table to celebrate my wife s birthday with the children 3 & 2 yrs old  during the phone call I was told we must be finished before 7 to accommodate the next booking I accept this is booking custom but to be so vocal about our presence being an inconvenience was a surprise  The restaurant is well laid out with a great extension which will be amazing during the summer The first waiter was insistent on removing the spare wine glasses as to prevent our children breaking them his words  The specials were not cheap at 25 each but we had heard positive reviews unfortunately our meal was ruined by cold sausages served to our daughter 2 years old  After waiting 45 minutes which I have no issues with the food should be hot and freshly prepared the problem was food served from the children s menu seemed an after thought as opposed to fresh restaurant quality instead serving pre-cooked sausages we sent them back and in few minutes fresh sausages arrived but again these were cold cooked not pink but cold The issues is compounded as when paying 50 for two mains we spent the time distracting our daughter from her lack of food  The special was average A rack of lamb should be a rack I revised lamb chops three individual pieces of lamb  The waitress was brilliant and mortified by our complaint 185 aims to be a premier restaurant but falls short  The children s meals were refunded but if you can t cook children s sausages you shouldn t be claiming for high quality 
neutral, My family have eaten here quite often over the years and generally it is to be recommended  The food is normally very good and our latest visit was no exception However we did notice that they have cut down on the quantity of vegetables and potatoes they were only just adequate  The owners weren t arouind on this visit and the front of house seemed to be somewhat po-faced and distant until it came to pay  The big let down for me was the dessert I very much fancied the treacle tart with clotted cream and remembered the last time I had this I was disappointed that it came cold Who wants cold treacle tart for goodness sake  I therefore asked the waitress if the tart was warmed so she went to check Back she came to say no it was cold So I then asked if it could be warmed so off she went to the kitchen only to return to say the tart could not be warmed  I would dearly have loved to ask what was so difficult in zapping the tart in the microwave for a minute but decided it wouldn t be fair on the waitress not her fault the kitchen staff weren t competent enough to operate a microwave so chose something else 
neutral, food quick we had a all day breakfast but unfortunately they didn t have any mushrooms so replaced with what I liked so I choosen onion rings   it was ok   price reasonable nice staff 
neutral, Good breakfast but wouldn t go back for the evening meal which is overpriced for the quantity and quality 
neutral, Arrived by chance as looking for some dinner whilst staying in hotel over the road No reservation made but this didn t seem to be a problem Quickly seated and drinks order taken Venue was quite busy with a large party but this didn t seem to cause any delays with the kitchen able to deliver Food well presented taste wasn t anything special however Well priced food and drinks 
neutral, A have visited this restaurant a few times but have the say the that last visit was extremely disappointing The food was average and only just warm The service was OK but not spectacular and it was nt even busy  Don t think I would visit again in the forseeable future 
neutral, Food was good especially starters calamari and scallops and desert chocolate brownie  Unfortunately though the service was VERY slow IT took about 15 minutes after being seated before we could order drinks then another 10-15 minutes till they came back to take our food orders Dinner itself was then close to a 45 minute wait After the meal there was another long wait just to get the bill 
neutral,I ate here last night with my wife and daughter We had pre-booked and I would suggest others do because several people were turned away due to it being full  We waited 5-10 minutes for drinks orders to be taken and wasn t ready to order food so the waiter said he d come back We had to wait another 10 minutes for him to return We ordered garlic bread for starter and I ordered a pizza and my wife ravioli of the specials board The waiter advised that it may best all coming together because otherwise it may take along time He was correct because several other tables around waited over 20 minutes between there starters being taken away and waiting for their mains  We had to ask for crayons 3 times for my daughter to do some colouring When they were brought we had 1 felt tip pen and 2 light pink crayons that cannot be seen on white paper So not much good  Overall  it was ok but just didn t seem organised with people having to wait too long 
neutral, Myself and three friends went to Circo on Sunday 20th April The atmosphere was excellent but one of the bar staff blatantly tried to rip me off for 30 of the 50 note that I handed him He was not only unapologetic but damn right rude when I sussed him out We reported this to the door staff so he ll hopefully get the bullet 
neutral,Not our first trip but memories of the ambiance and setting in this idyllic Cotswold inn made a return most welcome  Overall for lunch the menu is fine  the food OK if not outstanding and the service good yes it does seem at times as though you have been sidelined but when it comes it is smiling and helpful  But the Inn has style and a history and is worth a detour  It was a pleasant experience again and we will return   
neutral, I had dinner in chin chin a few months back This time the menu changed and the portion is not as much as I previously had It has greatly reduced I was looking forward going back to have dinner but it was a disappointment Overall it was still great food and waiter was very polite 
neutral,I enjoyed my food  Choosing the nandos for starters and the pulled pork for my main Can t fault the food staff were very helpful always offering drinks One member of the party could not eat their starter apparently was not up to standards at all  A little on the pricy side but as a treat out I would definitely recommend this place We went on a Saturday evening which was quite lively and probably best for friends and couples rather then people with younger children on the Saturday anyway 
neutral,Have eaten lunch upstairs with family earlier in month Food good although table service was a work in progress  Booked for breakfast today and was seated downstairs All staff friiendly courteous and efficient Fairly quiet- perhaps five other tables of diners We mostly went for full English but was a source of major disappointment When cutting up sausages for kids realised they were at best warm rather pale on outside and pink in centre Turned out this applied to all of us Then realised that the food was generally cold and potentially undercooked Staff were quick to remedy and could not have been more apologetic Overall experience was the proverbial curate s egg good in parts Come on Pierre we want you to be a success 
neutral, Been to this particular branch a couple of times an have never been let down by the food it has always arrived hot and fresh and portion sizes have been somewhat generous HOWEVER the one negative that alway gets in my way is the staff not all of them however  Just a select individual who deems it fun to speak rather bluntly to individuals and not take into account somebody with autism for once I followed this up and emailed through to the main company with name of the said staff member in hopes that it will be looked into  Such a shame as otherwise this place would get 5 stars take away this element and the place is brilliant with very friendly staff and good quality food 
neutral, Visited with family for a meal the food was not very well cooked and not hot enough surly staff who were very slapdash in their approach Will not be visiting again 
neutral, This was our second time visiting Sushi Samba and in the interest of full disclosure I have to say we were really impressed on the first visit with the atmosphere service and food This time was a different experience entirely The atmosphere is of course the same and still impressive - the views alone are worth a trip up the lift It s the food and service that fell far short this time though We went for an early dinner on Saturday and were seated around 4 30 The restaurant staff still seemed to be preparing for the evening rush and I suspect this is in large part what led to the poor food quality and weird service  We started off with a round of appetizers consisting of the pork belly and the wagyu gyoza Both tasted ok but were served luke warm - room temperature really We ordered salmon rolls for our son which he enjoyed and the black cod and fillet from the robata grill for mains along with a couple of the sushi rolls The fillet like the appetizers was served at room temperature We d ordered it medium rare and it was that but felt tough as though it had been sitting for a long time The cod was actually very nice and one of the few things we really enjoyed The rolls we ordered were all decent and the one with shrimp tempura and chili mayo was actually quite good  We also ordered a couple of pieces each of yellow tail and salmon from the nigiri sushi selection We asked our waiter if it was possible to get it aburri style - flame seared on top He at first told us no not possible because there was no grill at the sushi bar A different waiter overheard this and said it was in fact possible so the initial waiter confirmed our order of sushi and returned several minutes later with salmon and yellow tail sashimi We explained that we had ordered the sushi rather than the sashimi and he took the dish without comment and returned to the kitchen coming back several minutes later with the proper dish Overall the food was just not up to what we expected from the place - especially given the price  The service as well was strange Our waiter seemed impatient most of the time We spent a minute discussing which main we wanted and he was shifting from foot to foot looking at his watch the kitchen other waitstaff etc and generally giving off the impression that he had better things to do We told him the first main we wanted and he said very good and walked off - so we had to call him back to give him the rest of our order and when we did he seemed quite irritated One of the strangest parts of the meal was when shortly after our appetizers arrived the cleaning staff came in and started mopping the floor around our table The smell of bleach was an extremely unpleasant accompaniment to the meal but none of the staff found it even slightly strange that they d be cleaning around us while we were eating I saw another table that was boxed in against the window by a wet floor sign at one point  As I mentioned at the start of this review I think a number of these issues were due to the staff preparing for the evening rush but this is absolutely no excuse If you re going to keep your restaurant open between lunch and dinner you should be prepared to give the guests that visit during that time the same quality of food and service as you would at any other time And mopping the floors between tables that are seated is just weird and unprofessional 
neutral, An okay experience Lovely building though a little pastiche - would have been a fabulous space before which ever firm moved in and ripped out the original features to replace them with driftwood Food arrived VERY quickly almost too quickly   slight worry that it may have been microwaved Okay price though a little onthe steep side for what it was My triple-cooked chips I almost sent back for another cooking Nice wines Worth a visit 
neutral, Service was slow Staff were not very interested in customers Our group shared 5 different starters and they were all very nice Quality of main course dishes was variable I had lamb with rice The lamb was meat on the bone tender but not seasoned The rice with nuts etc was dull unseasoned luke-warm sprinkled with very few nuts and a few tiny pieces of mince Good quantity but uninteresting for a meal out Moderate prices and BYO alcohol are the positives We had a Lebanese meal in another town a few days earlier and that was very good quality and so we were expecting better 
neutral, Being Turkish Cypriot I think its safe to say that I know when your at a good mangal The food was very seasoned well very tender and the lahmacun is definitely up there with the best I have had being in Cyprus Turkey or here  However I don t want to harp on about the food and would rather focus on something that lets this place down  The service here is AWFUL I headed to the restaurant at 8 30pm on a Friday night without a booking and was told to come back at 9 30 After walking around for half hour or so me and my friend cam back to wait at the bar and have a drink We were greeted by the same chap who seemed surprised to see us 9 00pm He looked at his watch and said  I told you 9 30  Not the way i want to be greeted at restaurant  After finally being seated we had to get up and walk over to the service point to get menus as no one served us Twenty minutes later and we finally were served I ordered lamp chops which come with rice and salad however didn t want the rice so asked for a large salad instead I was told that this couldn t be done as the till wouldn t let him remove rice from the order  After waiting for an hour the food was finally served and was up to expectations Great food as usual but the service needs to be looked at  NOTE TO MANAGEMENT  You really should treat your staff with respect in front of customers Threatening to beat the s*** out of them whilst customers are around perhaps isn t the best idea 
neutral, Relatively unadventurous kids 17 and 14 but 17yr-old wants to travel in the Far East next year and a v cautious wife I ate well they didn  First off no alcohol Second off only 10-20 of tables full on Saturday night 9pm so none of the atmosphere other review spoke of We felt a bit scrutinised by the staff but we really enjoyed ourselves Fresh salad cut with coriander in the cold rolls was gorgeous the warm soggy rolls another of the starters were fantastically flavoursome 50 of the beef tough but everything v flavoursome The 17yr old liked her crispy fried free-range chicken and steamed rice the 14yr old found the belly pork too much - thank The Lord he d had bangers and mash at Goddard s earlier Wife ate spring rolls and probably found that enough Quite limited range of the menu but everything done well and full-on authentic Vietnamese  56 for 4 but quite a bit of our food went back uneaten 
neutral,Used to eat here often when visiting my Mother Last couple of visits have seen slow service and average food D€÷cor is very tired - urgently needs a refit
neutral, Not a very friendly inn restaurant which lacks atmosphere The food was ok but not cheap We sat in the bar area not the restaurant for our meal which might have been a mistake as no other customers appeared 
neutral, The 2 courses for 12 95 is definitely worth the money but don t expect wonders  The grilled Halloumi was a huge portion for a starter but had no colour from the grill  The Kleftico was fine but not a patch on Olive Tree s up the road  The Beef Spicy was remarkably dull Not spicy beef wasn t great The reviews previously suggested more unfortunately it s hype 
neutral,My wife and I visited the coffee shop for lunch on Wednesday 19 3 14 They seemed to be short of staff it was lunch time and not overly busy as we arrived at 12 45 We waited and waited for what seemed to be an age before we were visited by a waitress For some reason there seemed to be confusion by some of the staff Plenty of toing and froing But not much happening Our order was taken but not placed at the kitchen This was most unusual and as regular visitors we have never seen that type of problem before We hadn t got too much time available so unfortunately our experience lasted probably half an hour longer than we would have liked However I must say the food was excellent So it s not all doom and gloom Hope it was just a one off 
neutral, Good Points To quote Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction These are indeed Tasty Burgers although I don t know how they compare to Big Kahouna burgers And I didn t have them for breakfast The staff are attentive the parmesan and truffle oil fries are heaven Bad Points The tables are a little crowded 
neutral,We were greeted most warmly and offered a spacious table near the front window The table linen was delightfully crisp and the room itself was nicely decorated and airy Our pappadoms drinks and starters arrived promptly The house red and white wines were good value and matched the food well  Unfortunately the food itself was a disappointment bland and poorly spiced The Tandoori Mixed Grill showed very little charring with the result that both the chicken and lamb seemed strangely stewed Perhaps the tandoor was not up to full temperature The pilau rice was very plain almost like plain boiled rice The lamb bhuna was better and the meat tender and succulent  In short this could be an outstanding restaurant if the cooking was considerably better The service was excellent professional and friendly and the room itself had character and interest What a pity the food itself was not very good 
neutral, My partner and I dined here on a recent weekend stay in Mudeford The restaurant is very attractive the staff efficient and friendly although not an Italian waiter to be seen The fish was excellent sea bream cooked in a tomato based sauce sealed in foil However the accompanying roast potatoes were I am sure reheated and therefore hard and unpleasant My partner was less impressed with her choices and her mushroom starter course was below par So on the whole pretty average 
neutral,My wife is Filipina and to be honest we did expect a bit more from this restaurant It could certainly do with a spruce up The food was adequate buko pie was excellent  Prices are certainly on the high side to the quality of food presented There are many restaurants like this in Cebu itself - adequate without being inspiring so maybe we were looking for too much 
neutral, Been there for my girlfriend s b-day service as ok not too bad but could be a little bit better for the price of what we paid How the Italian like to say  Mamma Mia so expensive I would recommend another place if just want to have pizza pasta and a glass of wine What out for your wallet lol 
neutral, Great spot in the middle of Hungerford town decent selection of drinks standard food service a little disinterested though It is never good to feel like an inconvenience Will return and hope to feel a bit more wanted as it is quite close to us 
neutral, Went tonight for a friends 30th It was busy as one would expect for a Saturday evening well I d expect it to busy but obviously the management didn t  It s the only pub restaurant I ve seen where there s more people stood up than sat down The queue to order food was about 20 orders deep as was the queue for people waiting to be seated All this time there were about 8 staff walking about serving food etc and just two behind the bar serving food and drink customers I almost got to the point of walking out and going elsewhere  When I eventually got round to ordering the food the staff member that served me was a bit rude insisting I ordered one thing when I actually asked for something else  Once the food was ordered it came pretty quick so the cooks did a sterling job there  I went to the bar after we d finished our meals to request the child s jelly and was assured it would be with me now  I actually waited 20 minutes for it to arrive and was even more shocked to see it was a prepacked jelly so God knows what took so long  I m happy with the cleanliness of the place and the atmosphere but my overall experience was just average 
neutral, The restaurant was very busy we sat outside as we had the dog with us We had 4 meals quiche chilli soup and 2 jacket potatoes Unfortunately due to how busy it was the meals took 20 minutes to arrive and were cold and had elements missing At the prices paid you would expect more 
neutral,After wondering around York for the morning we wanted a breather and a nice cuppa and found this The atmosphere was great inside due to the decor and music  We played a game trying to find the songs we knew off the notation paper which is utilised as wall paper  We ordered tea for two as well as a bagel which arrived a little over done however still edible and a toasted breakfast muffin The staff were very friendly and it was not too crowded so great for a little respite from shopping or exploring 
neutral, The food is good for what you would expect from a chain pub nothing dazzling with the standard fayre of steaks burgers fish & chips Good bar so plenty of choices of liquid to wash down your surf n turf  
neutral, Six if us had lunch here and whilst we had a good time I would say the restaurant is at best average Firstly the toilets smell either of bleach or worse Toilets are very poorly maintained We were the only group in for lunch and when three if us ordered a dish the waitress returned to say they only had one left I also ordered a desert that when arrived had not set properly and was inedible They did offer another foc and a coffee on the house to compensate The atmosphere was very dull and the staff looked really bored and uninspired  To summarise there are lots of restaurants in the locality that offer better service food and atmosphere This place has a load of potential but its missing an attention to detail and a focus on the customer Would give it another try to see if its a one off as some of the food was great 
neutral, Food good and reasonable prices but you may have to wait for a table on a Sunday as it gets very busy They do a good breakfast at a good price and you can top up on rea and coffee free 
neutral, This is a meal revue not a residential review The event was a large and significant birthday celebration lunch and in the run up the hotel had been nothing but attentive and proper On the day we had been allocated a separate and quite lovely room and it became clear that the hotel had taken so many other lunch bookings there probably wasn t an option Sadly and despite advance information nothing had been done to accommodate one of our party s coeliac condition apart from a couple of pieces of very ordinary looking bread nor for another s egg intolerance The food was OK but far from outstanding and given the stable the hotel declares itself to be in - the Gidleigh collection of Andrew Brownsword hotels - and its ambitions for its own Michelin status it s got a long way to go The staff were all unfailingly lovely thank you for clearing up the glass I managed to sweep off the aperitif table  but forgot things and if I dare be brutally honest didn t understand English well enough to know what a Cointreau coffee is A couple of wines from the house list were very good indeed I d love to say we d go back because the setting is quite beautiful but we re spoilt for choice in the area and there are better places to eat Oh well never mind we were largely well looked after had fun and were pleasantly surprised at the overall cost 
neutral, Ok first please let me say this   LAMORNA cove itself is a slice of heaven I could happily just sit and enjoy the views all my life the coastal walks are a delight though can be a tad tricky at times the cafe is a tad expensive but us tourists are always being fleeced one way or another and the food and cakes are exceptional so I ll let that be now     The owner of Lamorna though is a different kettle of rotten fish  The toilets probably have never been cleaned and I d take your own toilet paper if I were you it s always empty  The car park attendants are doing there best to black list the place and have A levels in rudeness seriously if you park here take a picture of your car between the lines and two of your ticket as they will try anything to fine you  The wharf also has been left severely damaged by the storms and no attempt at repairs made  he has also built a lovely breeze block wall across a lovely property this you see as you enter the cove and is a total disgrace as it spoils the view as you enter in simple terms Lamorna it s self a jewel locals very friendly  owner and car park attendants a disgrace  
neutral, Very excited by what I saw when walking passed and tried the following day  Food was good but took a while to arrive  Waiter seemed over worked and rushed  Food reasonably priced  Would return but not in a rush 
neutral, Had a late lunch here following a visit to the nearby Imperial War Museum and took advantage of the lunchtime deal - pizza and a glass of wine for 10 This is a good offer the pizza was a good sized ham and tomato and came with a very generous glass of wine The welcome was warm and friendly my only gripe was the optional service charge of 10 which was already added to the bill I don t mind leaving a tip if it s been earnt but I do object to having the decision made for me 
neutral, Helpful staff pleasant enough with quick service Sat at bar by revolving food server Everything seemed nice and fresh Good value 
neutral,This is the on site eatery for the Premier inn at York North Nice friendly staff but a very limited wine and food menue and a tad pricey ie cod and chips 10-95 and no white zinfandal wine on menue ok as a one off but in my case once was enough 
neutral,I live in Sprotbrough where the Boat Inn is and with experience I will only use it as a last resort The food there is only average the drinks are very expensive around 4 for a pint of lager  I believe the Boat Inn owners think they have a captive audience and it is idyllic on a sunny summers day down by the river and lock etc The staff are mainly young people who work part time and can give the impression they don t want to be there To take young children there can be risky as there isn t a play area for them and the river and canal nearby 
neutral, 2 adults 1 child in our party Arrived and were told 20minute wait for a table  We were given a buzzer and the Staff suggested we wait at the bar for it to start vibrating to indicate that our table was available we didn t order any drinks at the bar 5 minutes later it went off and we were shown to our table Waitress then started by saying let me tell you what we haven t got which as we had already decided to opt for the Downtown set menu only left 1 starter to choose out of the 3 listed Oh well ordered this Anyway plus the classic burger all round and bottomless drinks lemonades couldn t have coke as this was one of the things they had run out of  Food and drinks arrived in reasonable time but the waitress did not seem that interested in checking that everything was ok or whether we would like refills of the drinks While we were waiting for the food to arrive we were watching the entrance and noticed that nearly all the people were being directed to the bar area first which seemed strange as there were clearly empty tables and oddly that the ones not buying drinks at the bar seemed to be getting seated quicker than those buying drinks now the cynic in me starts to think Maybe a deliberate ploy to get more money from drinks at the bar  As for the food the starters were ok but uninspiring the burgers did have a good flavour and the chips were ok but we didn t feel that we had gone to a restaurant and had a meal out as there was nothing that made It feel any better than say going to a Burger King or macdonalds for a burger which if we had would probably have cost us less than the 40 00 we did pay  We did not tip the waitress as she only showed any interest in us and asked us if we had had a good day when it was time to pay and presumably the chance of a tip and as their receipt says on the bottom Only great service deserves a tip and whilst we had service it was a long way from being great  It seems that the overall ratings for TGI s is average and we would have to agree In today s world of hard earned money if you are looking for a meal out then there are better places in Poole to spend your money  
neutral,We ve been here several times and enjoyed the quality of the food immensely but our most recent visit with the family was accompanied by very disappointing service We and the two other tables who were seated upstairs all felt completely ignored by the waitresses we spoke after waiting 20 minutes for our starter plates to be cleared  They delivered food but had to be flagged down for new drinks Even after we d gotten the bill we were kept waiting so long to pay more than ten minutes with empty glasses all round that we trooped down the stairs to ask to pay  We d assumed they were simply run off their feet downstairs so imagine our disappointment when we found that the three waitresses working had two tables down there and were mostly just cleaning up and closing down Literally the first time I can ever remember leaving no tip at all in a restaurant A nearly two hundred pound bill for two courses and two rounds of drinks for four people in a visit which took over two hours and we re not slow eaters   Anyhow like I said the food was genuinely delicious Just go when it s quiet and ask to sit downstairs so you can flag a waitress down 
neutral, The Glass Boat because it s a boat is one of Bristol s different restaurants  The food is good the service is good and the dining experience is that bit different  OK the menu always seems to include at least one item that requires a translation - evidence of a slightly presumptuous style But that is not reflected in the genuinely honest approach of the staff  In a city that is now bristling with restaurants the Glass Boat offers something a bit different 
neutral, The venue is nice but I m not a fan of having a TV on in a restaurant I guess it is next door to Stanford Bridge The service is fine The pizzas however are distinctly average It s a real shame because it is my local pizzeria but the pizza express on the kings road is so good There s a pizza express in Fulham Broadway station also but it s appalling If you want a good quality pizza in Fulham go to dominos 
neutral,The restaurant is really rather average for dinner but much better for breakfast  I entered the restaurant for dinner and the head waiter said that he could only accommodate me in 20 minutes time despite being half empty No apology - just cannot fit you in before 8 Only one other table table entered in this waiting period  The other staff were charming and helpful  Where I sat I could hear the head chef shouting very loudly at the kitchen staff and waiters Either don t shout or sound proof the kitchen  My starter of Caesar salad was minuscule although tasty  My broccoli leek and cheese pie was certainly above average with a nice crust and the filling was not overcooked  A pity as I will be staying often in the hotel but will not choose to dine here 
neutral, It s in Rickmansworth but it s prices are in Mayfair A nice pub but scores lower because of the exorbitant cost of booze 
neutral, Sunday early evening and the place is half empty which should be good  but the noise from a large family table 16 echoed around the high roof Nice greeting and quick service too quick as we got another tables drinks Small bits of bread and olive oil as an aperitif then ribs and a salad for starters and fegatini with lamb and mint for mains All very tasty and appetising The prices were a little more expensive than our usual two Italians and the food not as good so it may be another 6 years before we get back 
neutral, Went here for a meal with some friends last night booking was easy enough as i always do this online wherever possible so its good to see the website has this function Have been to ASK before down south when in London and remember it was good but i think this place has still a lot to learn  The place is very modern inside which is nice was moderately busy and service and the waitress was friendly and happy to recommend dishes We ordered drinks and probably must of been 30 seconds we got our drinks starters arrived quickly too Starters were good and very filling A bit of a wait for the mains we actually forgot that we ordered them  Some had pasta other a pizza the pasta tasted funny and a bit off sour on mine and was very appetizing Others did enjoy there pizzas I had the Fettuccine Porchini which was very creamy The menu does have a good selection Quick service average food there are better places to go if you want an Italian in my opinion local to the middle-brook Reasonably cheap with drinks and a 3 course 20 per head Definitely try and see for yourself 
neutral, Make no mistake The Crown and Anchor at Dell Quay is a pub in the full sense of the word It has TV screens with football showing sometimes it has a nicotine stained ceiling dog treats on the bar and a stack of high chairs in the corner Quite obviously catering for the mass market of seasonal visitors in the summer rather than regular lunch goes it gets very busy there at weekends especially if the weather is good  I would describe the decor at The Crown and Anchor as rough and the toilets as unclean On my last visit here while seated near a window I happened to look behind the radiator that was next to me only to see mouldy chips fluff and old napkins trapped behind it  The staff are ok but the service could do with being a little more friendly and personal All things considered the food is pretty good to be honest 
neutral,First visit to celebrate my birthday Excellent welcome and service and they had heeded our request not to be seated around any of the Halloween paraphilia they had around which was appreciated Food good we both had fillet steak they didn t quite get it right on the medium rare and medium front - but nice steak and to much sauce served with it The owner manger was very attentive and concerned that we hadn t got the steak cooked just as we like - we appreciated her concern Overall it was a good experience not fantastic but good 
neutral, Went for lunch but unfortunately missed the carvery and specials We ordered Lasagne and Pork in cider with veg and roast potatoes Food was ok but veg and potatoes were dry and probably left over from carvery 
neutral, Food was what we expected for the price Ales where good and served well Would go back again as live close by 
neutral, A little bit dis- organised waiting for a table a while found our own table very busy place the waiting staff were doing there best but i think they were overwhelmed at times and didnt get much chance to clean up some food on the floor and the tables were lightly cleaned 
neutral, We stopped for lunch  We found our own seats and helped ourselves to menus  When the barstool noticed our menus were swapped for lunch menus - not really a problem however I did ask if I could order from the main menu and was told no - which was then contradicted when another party did the very same thing 10 minutes later and were allowed to  The food is well done and nice  If they can get the service right it would be a wonderful place deserving of another star 
neutral, Have now eaten there twice Whilst the salad bar is good on both occasions I had cause to complain about the chicken 1st visit it was very dry and despite the waitress s denial I am convinced it had been kept hot on the grill The 2nd occasion my chicken portion was so shrunken that I thought it was widgeon I was also put off by the draught beer It should never be served ice cold That temperatures is for lagers I shall not visit here again  
neutral, We had this venue recommended by friends who raved about it Maybe we caught it on a bad day Monday 14th Oct  We were a little early but the table was ready-a plus point Chose the standard afternoon tea It was good but only just good no more than that We had expected above average and felt that two scones were a cheap filler upper even if the cream with them was excellent Those sarnies were nothing special Our waiter obviously went for a break halfway through our tea as the service became a little less attentive We did not enjoy being gawped at by the visitors to The Baths who seemed to have license to wander in and out of the eating area at will take photos and generally spoil the elegance and atmosphere of this lovely place The young lady on the till seemed a bit vexed that we didn t wish to put a tip on our card payment-that would be because we d left our tip on the table but didn t feel the need to explain ourselves to her Overall we were a bit disappointed We would still say to someone try it  but it has a long way to go before it gives Bothams at Whitby a run for their money 
neutral, Four of us in our 60s 70s booked a table for 7 30pm on a Friday evening and were soon seated We sorted our drinks out at the bar and made our selection from the menu only to be told that there would be a 45 minute wait for our food to be prepared  Shame really but I suppose it was a Friday Everything fine waitress friendly but busy so not a lot of interaction Nice but nothing special 
neutral, Been there with some friends for dinner service was nice for a reasonable 16 The big sushi to share platter didn t look as it did in the menu pictures and it had surimi on it 
neutral, Mary Jane s Fish Bar is really in two halves one half is Take away and the other half is for a sit down meal The range of fish etc is very good and the chips are just great Portion sizes are reasonable and the prices are competitive with other similar venues in Cromer My wife and I have been several times but usually with a group all going to Cromer pier to see a show The service is fairly quick so overall I rate it good 
neutral, We loved the drive into Ston Easton winding through the woods until you reach the manor house  We were greeted by a lovely man who suggested we took drinks in the lounge we were given the choice of any of the rooms to have our ap€÷ritifs in - we chose one of the lovely main rooms complete with large chairs and views of the grounds  Once shown through to the dining room we had a chance to really take in the decorations around us - slightly over the top and old hat but I guess they fit the look they are going for The menu offered a good choice - on a whole we both enjoyed all of our courses I thought my wild trout with pickled cucumber was excellent though the confit duck terrine was forgettable Their wine list is interesting and not too pricey the Pinot Noir from Orgeon that we chose was perfect  We took tea and petis fours on their beautiful terrace in the early summer sun It was an all together pleasant midweek lunch it must be said 
neutral, I have not been to the Barley Mow for some years and the d€÷cor since we were last there gives a very warm and relaxing atmosphere Greeted by polite and friendly staff who were very attentive and made us feel very welcome However whilst there is a good selection from the menu the food only warranted an average rating and I agree with Rachel H s review that more time should be spent on the quality of food and not the quantity The food arrived promptly but one of the steaks was not cooked as requested and the gammon and the pineapple had spent too much time on the chargrill  Finally having eaten at another restaurant quite recently and being charged 4 09 for a large glass of Chardonnay imagine my surprise when being charged 5 15 for the same drink at the Barley Mow I could have brought a good quality bottle of wine for the price of the two glasses purchased here 
neutral, The menu here is very good and there is a good selection of cask ales Staff friendly and attentive but if you hit a shift change you can get forgotten  The only problem I find is that whenever we eat here the vegetables always seem to be cold on arrival Even if you send them back they only revert to luke warm Occasionally it is obvious that the food has been under the heat lights for too long but they are very good at replacing food if you let them know there is a problem Overall pretty good but some attention to detail required 
neutral, Popped in for a quick drink as it had started raining staff pleasant enough pub looked tired with peeling wall paper tables needed a good clear down and clean Shame as location looking over the sea front is lovely 
neutral, It s a family restaurant that doesn t want to forget it s still a pub so there s music blaring and a fair number of drinkers in the public bar But the rest of the place is spacious and there are plenty of tables The menu though should be a warning - there s nothing they can t offer steaks burgers ribs curries sandwiches Italian Mexican You just know it s all delivered by a catering van and warmed up specially for you That said the food was tasty enough and it wasn t expensive 
neutral, I was really looking forward to the French Table as I have heard good thing about this place Maybe my expectation were too high but I felt it was a normal high street restuarant with very high menu prices I have eaten in top restaurants in central London who serve great food and paid alot less But on the positive the food was tasty and the service friendly The venue itself is small and tables are very close together which makes the place feel very cramped After seeing the final bill I didnt think it was worth the price as there are other great restaurants in Surbiton charging alot less for their hospitality 
neutral,Have dined here a few times now Food is always good value and good service Restaurant is clean and fresh looking still unlike the Harvester across the road  Standard experience at othe similar chain restaurants 
neutral,Went there to celebrate the new job of my girlfriend and upon entry the restaurant looked the part We were sat in a far corner of the restaurant feeling rather neglected by the service Looking at the menu it seemed very well priced however we were later informed that the burgers were not served with any sides but 6 95 for just a burger is very over priced I opted for the sea bass and my girlfriend opted for the burger and ordered a side of sweet potato fried and garlic bread to start the food was good but the sea bass was small i wouldn t mind visiting again but i would consider other options first 
neutral,Went here for a office lunch in December 2015 I was impressed that we didn t have to pre-order our meal days in advance - a good sign I thought The staff were lovely throughout the visit no complaints there at all The started and dessert was delicious The main was easily the worst Christmas dinner I have ever had The portion was small the vegetables not cooked through properly so it was a huge let down I had heard great things about the restaurant but alas it dint live up to expectations Maybe it was just a bad visit Personally I wouldn t rush back there but if I did go there with friends I would be interested to see if my opinion changes 
neutral, On arrival the car park was packed   and all tables seemed taken but as we were early  not a problem Table fro three   with three starters and three mains For me   the main of Fish Pie was awful  possibly the worst I have ever eaten  Well half eaten Poor quality white fish swimming No pun intended in a watery white liquid Tasteless    and bland All was saved by attentive smiley service   
neutral, Ten years ago this seminal Soho restaurant was leading the way for great Asian cuisine Although still better than most I fear its glory days will be behind it if it does not up its game Don t get me wrong the food is good the service impeccable but I always expect more I will be coming back soon as I live in hope that the spark will come back  
neutral,Friday lunchtime Not very busy so service was fairly good Food O K Needs a total re-paint what paint there is is filthy and needs a good clean inside and out It needs new furniture and carpeting It looks as though they have been to a car boot sale or auction and bouight whatever chairs they could find looks really tatty The carpet is a disgrace especially where the food is brought through I expect to see children but I must admit they aught to be more controlled Will call again when when the work has been done BUT NOT BEFORE  
neutral, We visited late on a Sunday afternoon so perhaps we were unlucky to get dried up offerings but it disappointed The service was friendly if a bit slow but when the food arrived disappointment set in My cheese scone was well over cooked and dry and not very tasty Linda s fruit scone was a bit better The coffee was okay and they did serve decaf tea which was good to see The surroundings are Spartan and the upstairs section is up some very steep stairs Not good for the less fit Average at best 
neutral, This is a conventional Thai restaurant It does not try to be hip or trendy or experimental with the dishes There s Thai decor & waitresses in Thai costume However it is cosy food is passable & service friendly Overall it is good value 
neutral, Ordered takeaway First issue no prices were on the website if you have to ask perhaps you can t afford it - lol  Well across the board prices were more expensive than any other place we ve ordered from in the area - justified not in our opinion Food quality flavours were around good to average and portion sizes a little on the small side  I m use to getting two servings from a biryani  Customer service was pleasant and seemed efficient but the worst mistake placing the order in a paper bag and not sealing the containers properly = stained car seat not amused  Would I eat here again probably not but others may love the style and prices  So despite everything I would say give it a try it s different from your usual indian restaurant 
neutral, Chose The Otter Inn as a halfway meeting place to meet family We arrived at 12 15 and diners were already eating their luncheon choice from the carvery Obviously a popular place for locals as the place filled quickly and a long queue formed Three choices of meat and three prices could be paid for a small medium or large plate Only one visit to the carvery so no going back for more  Not that we wanted to Atmosphere was souless with a canteen  air  about it and the food matched The table was wobbly and bare with mismatched cutlery Very friendly chef however we would have preferred him dressed more professionally with the whites white and smarter trousers rather than track suit bottoms and scruffy shoes Sorry not for us 
neutral, We decided to stop by for a bite to eat after work Things got off to a bad start as a waitress forced her way past us on the stairs like a bull in a china shop We were seated by I assume the manager who talked us through the menu and advised a waitress would be over soon for our drinks order Our actual waitress was lovely and very attentive  We ordered a lemon vanilla martini to drink from the limited cocktail menu The drink was not amazing but it looked nice in the glass We got tap water for the table but this tasted off I think the glasses had not been rinsed properly  My squid and mussel pasta was delicious really flavourful and a decent portion The pizza of the day of chicken pesto this was a major let down The base had a huge amount of crust and the lack of cheese was a surprise It was impossible to cut too Overall I think this place is just a little bit pretentious and I would advise you to stick to your local italians 
neutral, I was attending the Everyman Theatre for their Rock n Roll Panto Having enjoyed the Everyman Bistro before the refurbishment we were looking forward to enjoying a pre-show meal in the Pen Factory especially having read the reviews on Trip Advisor Unfortunately my wife and I were both disappointed with the menu and left without ordering No complaint with the ambience No complaint with the excellent selection of craft beers Paddy I m assuming it must be down to my advancing years 75 I struggled with the menu Maybe a Lasagne for us oldies 
neutral,I have been slightly disappointed by this restaurant I have been to this restaurant several times and it was always very good Somehow the last time they managed to disappoint me Took forever to serve the food and once we received it was not great too  Roti canai was assembled from defrosted paratha  They have so much potential but  
neutral,We ve eaten here a couple of times and the food and service are good This time we were seated out the back by the toilet and kitchen doors It s way too bright out there and people keep slamming the door into your chair as they go to the toilet 
neutral, Good draft beer and a great atmosphere Disappointingly the menu is stuck in a time warp and would benefit from being refreshed Despite its failings its still a favourite Book to eat early as parking is very limited 
neutral, There was a very good atmosphere here with good music being played and we all felt very welcome We went upstairs for drinks becuase downstairs was far to packed A downside maybe was that i felt the drinks where a bit pricey and there was a bit of a wait for drinks as there was only one person on the bar However i would recommend this place 
neutral, went there for a pizza nice base and ingredients Order a Parma Ham Pizza probably they just need to put on it more Parma ham mine was with just 2 slices of ham  But in the end it was good 
neutral,I got the mixed salad box The food is good and tasty However is suffers from that 1980s thing of the veggie option being the meat dish minus the meat I m not expecting more from a stall that specialises in goat meat But basically the salad portion is the same as what the meat eaters get but with air where the meat was I did have a bit of a go at the man serving Standing in line probably isn t the best situation to have a discussion so it probably seemed more of a moan than a explanation The standard options with meat make up a lunch If you take away the meat you don t have a lunch Veggie s don t have smaller appetites I understand the economics but I would rather pay more and get more food As I m typing this I m already feeling hungry and will probably go out again to spend more money topping up my feeding needs So I m willing to part with the cash to feel more full I would rather that money went on more salad than a chocolate cookie Shame - as a good mixed salad and this a good one  is as rare as hen s teeth in the Borough market area 
neutral, Visited on a Tuesday night when the restaurant was rather quiet We were greeted by a friendly waitress who showed us to a table in the centre of the restaurant which was slap bang in the middle of two tables that were very close to our table which made us feel quite uncomfortable I asked the waitress if we could move to another table in the corner which seemed to be free however we were told that it wasn t ready yet  This was annoying as the table was left empty throughout our whole meal and no staff attended to the table in order to make it ready   Food was average Ordered a blue cheese and bacon burger which tasted nice however the bottom burger bun was soggy and fell apart whilst trying to eat This was the same with my girlfriend s burger We had noticed that there was a lot of food sat on the pass waiting to be taken out and staff seemed to be more preoccupied by cleaning tables than serving the food You would have thought being a burger restaurant they would have mastered the art of serving a burger a non soggy bun to accompany their burgers Shame 
neutral, We Have loved carluccio s for many years The new menu reduces the amount of pasta dishes on offer and gives more expensive choices The 2 course lunch deal has disappeared  this may prove a bad business idea given cote around the corner still offers their 2 course deal  The food we had though was very tasty See my pics I had ravioli filled with cheese and lemon  wish they would bring back the sage and butter ravioli see my pictures Would liked to have given the food 4 rating but new limited pasta menu takes it down to three as I can t opt for 3 5 Bring back lunch deal please 
neutral, Staff were friendly but the food was very average my wife s starter only had 2 scollops which were cut in half and my pizza was very average won t be going back 
neutral,Visited the lakeside for a Sunday lunch with family  Goods points Food very nice everyone enjoyed their meals and staff who served very pleasant  Bad point restaurant was quite cold  Disgusting point I went to the toilet which had 2 cubicles one was occupied so I used the other Whoever was using the other cubicle left their cubical and the toilet room without washing their hands When I returned to my table I asked my partner who came out of the toilet before me and she stated a member of staff 
neutral,At 16 95 for two courses it isn t bad value but it really isn t up to the standard the surroundings lead you to expect The menu was limited - fish or beef but this wouldn t normally worry me as I much prefer well cooked fresh ingredients from a limited menu than a huge choice of stuff from the freezer We both chose fish sea bass and sole Both were very nice but the fat cut chips and mashed up peas that accompanied were not great not seasoned and not much taste  For starters we both had the squid served in a limp soggy batter and pretty tasteless but on a bed of really exceptionally good spicy salad I m trying not to be deliberately unfair but they could really do so much more - the restaurant room is great the ambience is great the staff in there are really good attentive without being intrusive  and it s just such a shame that the food is only pretty average  We would eat there again but only if there weren t any reasonable local pubs serving food
neutral, Myself and my partner visited early evening on a Friday and we had no problems being seated The staff were polite and attentive and said all the right things at the right times the only thing was they were a bit miserable But you couldn t knock the food and that made up for it excellent 
neutral, Went with my wife while visiting London First impressions were good- a well-designed comfortable restaurant with a decent atmosphere when full The tables however were closer together than in our local unpretentious Italian The staff were attentive and friendly and service was quick However I have two major criticisms The food is over-priced My starter - a plate of rocket seasoned with cheese with a wafer-thin cheese crisp on top was more than 14 The prices would have been acceptable if the food had some sort of wow factor but it doesn t My main course was plaice The quality of the fish itself was so-so and the basil crust potato olives and tomato sauce just didn t work For 28 it was seriously lacking My wife s verdict on her lamb was that it was very nice but 80 of it was bone The wine list however is extensive and our desserts were good Thank heavens we had a very full and delicious bread basket I don t know how restaurants get Michelin stars but I ve eaten in plenty which are better than this charge half as much and don t have a star Perhaps we were just unlucky on a first visit 
neutral, Good fish seats crammed in The sort of fare I have at chips near my home but costing less  Not bad 
neutral, If you like neon lights and illuminated fish tanks this is the place for you  If however you like a good curry you are best to avoid  I found the food to have very unpleasant sour taste on two occasions of dining here Also the meat used was also very industrialised and was perfectly cubed at 10x10x10mm Service was very mechanical and had little personality  Just to add weight to this comment I have worked in the food industry for over 10 years and many of which was developing Indian food for the grocery retailers so I know my way around a curry menu and also now how industrial cut meat comes in  
neutral, Popped in for a Dinner last Friday night portions of the ribeye steak was extremely small after finishing the wine no more was offered  it s like they were rushing to go home even though was only 10 to 10pm nothing special was not a wow experience 
neutral,Visited here in January with family food was nice but veg was cold We were hurried along with the courses and felt we were being rushed to finish our meals What really put us off was when we had finished the bill was promptly given to us we said we were going to order another round of drinks and sit in the bar so we could pay all at once But as soon as we got up another waitress thrust the card machine into our hands and more or less demanded payment there and then Made us look like a bunch of crooks about to do a runner therefore i have to say its put me off returning again 
neutral,Got take away from here - all pretty standard Staff were stressy though which was a shame A smile and thank you wouldn t hurt 
neutral, First visit here and after visiting a Marston s pub before thought we would have the Sunday lunch which had been recommended from a visit to a different Marston s pub Very disappointed veg tasteless roast potatoes mushy and the chicken came out as a whole chicken with skin and bones not carved like we expected my husbands face was a picture as he can eat meat but has a major phobia about bones It was just like a microwave meal really On the other hand the puddings were great we had apple crumble and sticky toffee pudding Had 2 sunday lunches and 2 puddings for 15 which is a great offer but unfortunately the main meal wasn t to our liking 
neutral,Very nice food duck salad very nice when we arrived the table was ready I felt i was rushed off the table keep filling your classes and clearing give you no time to enjoy it I must say the food was very but should be for the prices they charge 
neutral, We visited early evening before a theatre show even then there was a lovely atmosphere downstairs and very full Unless you are lucky enough to get a booth table you will feel very squeezed in and suffer from a small table somehow it still works  The food was a mixed success I had a wonderful beef dish with amazing side of petit pois both recommended along with the amazing bread My wife had the salmon dish which was by far the worst fish dish she has had for years The Salmon fillet was so over cooked it was bone dry and lost all flavour  If we didn t have the problem with the meal the rating would have been higher as the rest of the experience was very good The staff are excellent efficient with a sense of humour 
neutral, Had fish and chips both were reasonably good Fish was big and tasted ok and chips were no better than average but small portion Very expensive compared to other chip shops and service was incredibly slow 
neutral, My wife and I visited here and were going to have something on the two for a tenner menu but after having a look at the limited options decided to have a mixed grill each at double the price which let s be fair is still not a massive amount for a meal but enough to warrant a good meal  I ll be fair enough to say it was average Edible but certainly nothing to write home about  We probably won t be visiting again 
neutral,Wonderful food but      the service levels are very poor for a restaurant which wants to achieve high standards Having to constantly chase for them to take orders  drinks even napkins  lets them down so much
neutral, Twelve of us booked a table for Sunday lunch My wife and I opted for roast which was OK although the veg was underdone Others had variety of steaks and deserts Pub was very busy as you would expect on a Sunday Showing football on large screen Haven t been here before - obviously very popular local for people living in the Plympton area 
neutral,The restaurant looks really nice and the food was fine But it was let down by very slow service in a restaurant that was not at all full  To his credit at one point the waiter apologised for the slow service saying it was because there was large party on another table it had 6 people 
neutral,Very empty but ok inside Lovely tarka dal Chicken Korma was tad sweet and a stark yellow colour Lamb tikka masala was also very sweet and a very lurid red colour All in all tasty but really must lay off the food colouring 
neutral, We were very happy with the attentive service and pleasant atmosphere The food and drink was good and competitively priced However the issue of a bill with a 10  optional service charge added is a pet hate of mine and it must be said not all nearby Greenwich restaurants adopt this unpleasant practice If you are going to increase the listed menu prices at least do so in a less underhand way 
neutral, I so wanted to like this restaurant so much but overall I was disappointed along with my 3 companions On the plus side I liked the interior decor and ambience of the River Cottage Canteen Winchester  It was buzzy yet relaxed we were able to linger over our meal and weren t rushed through Service was attentive and efficient without being over bearing We started with 2 sharing platters - a Veggie and a meat platter between 4 This was the best part of the meal - plenty of variety and good flavours The mushroom crumble and lamb with beetroot were the highlights For mains I had the fish stew which was good but very rich  i have been spoilt by the Cornish Fish stew at Sheekeys in London which is divine The duck leg was very disappointing and very salty - two companions had this and were both struggling to find anything good The plaice was ok - my friend said it was a bit oily Overall the manis were pretty average Lemon curd posset followed which was a nice palate cleanser but the honey and almond cake was dry  So its a bit of a curates egg  good in parts but overall we left disappointed We did feedback via the  in house form We wouldn t return- sadly 
neutral, A regular haunt Costa in Leighton Buzzard has friendly staff but is a victim of its own success Queues can easily snake through the shop at peak times and patience is a must Finding a seat can be a challenge especially if you are flying solo but if you ditch the usual British reserve and share a table with a stranger some interesting conversations can be had 
neutral,I recently stayed at the Reebok stadium the night before Newcastle United played Wigan at The DW Stadium We didnt want to stay in the hotel and explored the surrounding areas of the stadium and found The Harvester nearby From the outlook the place looked busy but the building work and beer garden needs a good transformation as looked dirty and run down As we entered the place we were greeted by a lady who showed us to our table Not before long we were served by a friendly waiter named Matt We thought it was only right to have a pint of guiness with it being the weekend of St Patrick We ordered 2 rump steaks which when arrived were piping hot and cooked to perfection Overall our meal and service was excellent We felt as though the outside needed a good tidy and lick of paint while inside was nice but may need a refurbishment in the very near future On a personal note we would like to thank Matt for his kind service and if anyone attends The Harvester recommend his services as he was friendly and wouldnt be a problem to go out your way what ever your request 
neutral, As title really we had the 18 course meze and although was plenty of food the food itself wasn t great quality or of great taste Was ok service was good not sure we would go back voluntarily 
neutral,Was not the best steak I ve had for over 100 for just me and my wife  Pleasant restaraunt but I feel very overpriced for the quality
neutral, Wish I could tate this place higher but there were a few minor things that left me a little frustrated  Perhaps there was a staffing problem that Saturday but despite waiting to be seated I was not acknowledged by the one member of staff that seemed to be serving meals to a busy restaurant so I quietly sat myself down and made my lunch selection of soup followed by mushroom risotto I waited ages for the girl to reappear but after about 25 minutes I suddenly spotted a small notice in the far corner that instructed me to place my order at the counter which I proceeded to do  I then waited what seemed an exhorbitant lenght of time for the soup to arrive which when it did arrived with my risotto hence the long wait despite the fact that it was quite evident that I was dining alone  The soup was delicious and when the risotto arrived that was good too and had not demished in quality despite being kept warm for 15 minutes while I ate the soup  Probably just as well I was merely killing time waiting to see friends who live in the village  Do go and try this place I am sure you will have a better experience the food was great had there been just a little extra attention to detail and it would have a been a fine lunch 
neutral, We haven t been to the Fox & Barrel for nearly a year after an average food experience Yesterday evening we returned and five of us had very good starters & main courses This was the Fox & Barrel at it s best However on asking to see the desert menu we were abandoned so took matters into our own hands retrieving a menu from an adjacent table I then attracted the waiter s attention but he declined to take our desert order saying he would be back later When eventually returning he told us a desert order would take 20 minutes to arrive and it was clear by his manner he hoped we wouldn t order He told us there was only one chef preparing deserts and hence the delay We decided to order a single coffee and then left Whilst this was going on the head chef was standing by an adjacent table talking to guests All in all it was a somewhat disappointing experience The Fox & Barrel serves good food at it s best but needs to recognise it has serious competition in the area offering a superior dining experience 
neutral, The service and the people working here are brilliant very friendly but the overall quality of the food was just okay  I find these chains to be a little hit and miss so wasnt expecting great things but had hoped for something better after reading the reviews  Will give it another when next in the area 
neutral, Don t make it to Camden much but was up there the other day wanted a quick lunch out of the rain and Poppies was the first place that I sited The place was booming but one of the many very pleasant staff on hand found me a table quickly and left me with a menu Didn t think to scan it - after all when your in a chippie what else would you want - and ordered a regular cod chips mushy peas and coke  The food came quickly enough and the peas were I must say more plentiful than I had expected and very tasty too The chips were also quite good - double fried nicely crisp on the outside and they didn t congeal across the meal The cod by contrast was a disappointment only a 6 - good crisp batter but the fish was not as flakey as it could be and it must be the smallest regular portion I ve ever seen all things considered I just don t think that the meal warranted the 16 10 bill 
neutral, Sunday lunch so not the full menu Pork was good but the sirloin beef was fatty and grissly - looked like it had been bought pre-cut rather than carved from a joint Service was OK although waiter forgot to tell us about the turkey special Nice inside and good atmosphere and will definitely come again 
neutral,I went there few times for dinner or just for drinks always been a good time Food wise is nothing special but the atmosphere is what makes that place special so the location and the interior I will keep going good cocktails and nice beer 
neutral, Good food spoilt by slow service from the kitchen  We went for a family Sunday lunch seven of us I would estimate the restaurant was about 40 full and the table service in itself was polite and attentive but the kitchen was so slow it took 2hours 45 minutes from point of placing our first food order to finally paying the bill and leaving  I ve eaten here at other times Friday lunchtime mostly and it was a lot better again very good quality and served much faster  Its a fantastic redevelopment of the old smelly pub that it used to be and its been done very well indeed  the speed from the kitchen let it down that day I will go again but I will avoid Sunday lunchtime 
neutral, Booked here as we had a Tastecard and wanted nice surroundings relaxed atmosphere which this place has you can tell by the pictures   Greeted nicely shown to table we had booked waiter friendly Ordered 10oz Ribeye & a Pork dish wrapped in ham & a bottle of Hardys Riddle Had to wait a little while for the wine and the food came shortly after Steak cooked to perfection delicious but pork dish was a little on the small size even for the Wife  although well cooked and presented We asked for the dessert menu but didn t chase it up didn t get it decided against it paid up n left  With the Tastecard offer n tip the bill came to 40 which is fab value but would have been closer to 55 without the card  Loss of 2 stars one for the smaller portions one for the value  Note we had the same bottle of wine for 7 45 at Molloy s the night before  this was 17 85 at Brasserie Brunel - and two mains for under 8 better portions too  Better surroundings at Brunel lovely atmosphere but you are certainly paying for it 
neutral, The Bell is now in the hands of green king group in my opinion it as lost some of its appeal its not the same anymore 
neutral, We chose this restaurant for a meal because it looked very nice - good stylish decor We also chose it because it had a 2 for 1 offer on the sandwich board outside Being a bit cynical about offers I double checked that there wasn t a catch  No  I was told all you had to do was download the voucher code from the website which myself and a co-diner did there were four of us  Service seemed OK initially and we ordered our drinks After at least 20 minutes of waiting they eventually arrived We then had to chase the staff so we could order our food - we were on a time limit The food then took about half an hour to arrive - we had now been sat there for 50 minutes The food was actually very good no complaints there However when we came to pay the waiter said the 2 for 1 deal was Sunday to Thursday this was a Saturday  I informed him that the waitress didn t mention that despite me specifically asking about the terms and any catches I suggested he honour the offer which he did after a little bit of persuasion He then went off to give the waitress a dressing down All in all the food was good but to echo other reviews the service was very slow and the staff did seem disinterested in us 
neutral, I have been here many times over the years but this experience left me vowing never to return Having been asked for our drinks order quite quickly on what was a very busy Saturday night we decided to give our food order at the same time as we knew exactly what we wanted although the waiter failed to write anything down The starters arrived and were enjoyed but we then proceeded to wait another 30 - 45 minutes before asking if we had been forgotten The waiter  proprietor s son  was quite defensive and disputed the length of time that we had waited saying that we could see that they were very busy Eventually the main course arrived but upon tucking in we realised that the dish was not what we had ordered As we had waited so long already and couldn t bear to wait all over again - we were hungry - we duly ate the food though severely curtailing our enjoyment When the afore-mentioned waiter returned to clear our table and asked if we had enjoyed our meals we explained that we thought that we had had the wrong dishes he made light of the fact saying that we all make mistakes We told him that we thought that his attitude was very defensive and unapologetic to which he disagreed By now his father  the proprietor  had got involved I said that we had been to the restaurant over the years  which he acknowledged  but told him that I didn t intend to return due wholly to their attitude to which he said  up to you  I was frankly amazed at their lack of customer service They then proceeded to bring us our bill without asking us if we would like anything else  which of course we didn t  and we realised that we were being thrown out - never to return  It is clear from our experience and from reading other reviews on here that all is well if all goes right but if anything goes wrong it s the customer who is at fault 
neutral, Food good and basic Local sourced however feel it could be better The food was well cooked and flavoursome Not as good as the Craster arms but still worth going to 
neutral, I regularly go there and food is good and also the atmosphere I have a friend who works there and serves us well Only thing i would like to tell you is dont give tips as it goes to owners and not to the staff I know it as my friend works there 
neutral, When arriving in Kaspas we were greeted by a friendly manager who sat us to the table and explained the ordering process When in the Que for ordering there was a peculiar smell there was also boxes of waffle mix just behind the till stacked high The food itself was a generous portion looked good but just tasted ok and did not live up to the hype The drinks were a differant story like my order and the surrounding tables next to mine it took over 15 mins to bring the drinks which is ridiculous when all they do is put a curly straw in a glass bottle of coke Overall the experience was very average had good press and advertising but did not live up to the expectations 
neutral, This was not the first time we had eaten here but from my point of view it may well be the last We had booked a table for four and were initially disappointed to be shown a table large enough for four but only dressed for two Easily put right sure but not the point  The menu is extensive perhaps too much choice especially when taking into account all the daily specials Service was prompt enough - perhaps on occasions too quick Hardly had cutlery been placed on dishes than the staff were there to whisk the used stuff away The food was quite acceptable although nondescript I had Calamari as a starter The portion served was small and my plate filled up with a poor salad Calamari to my mind does not benefit from being served with salad The other starters and main courses were no more than acceptable although the House wine left a bitter aftertaste That said it did seem as if the Waiters were to a certain degree running round like headless chickens The only ones who seemed to have a sense of order about them were two young ladies who went about their duties in a calm efficient manner and got a lot done  The greatest disappointment however for what is a popular restaurant was the condition of the toilets I was able to see into the Disabled toilet and this like the Gentlemens  had paper towels all over the floor which in turn was absolutely filthy Just what the Ladies was like I cannot say The restaurant may have been busy but there really is no excuse for this 
neutral, The Waggon reopened today after refurbishment and we went along to take a look  First impressions count for a lot The old Waggon was tatty but full of character The new Waggon has carpet carpet  on the floor in all but the main bar and while money has plainly been spent here the character seems to have largely gone Thirteen hand pumps on the bar together with a selection of keg beer cider and lager means that the choice of tipple is quite wide but the food offering was limited to a few cobs I ve no idea whether more food will be offered once things settle down  The pub has been enlarged The long-closed shop wasn t it a hairdressers once was been knocked through into a larger seating area and the predominantly pink and let s face it awful Barbara Cartland lounge has gone too But what s in it s place is smart enough but the Waggon was never about smart  but you could be anywhere  The bar counter seems bigger than before and it was a silly decision to site fixed seating directly opposite it particularly as the other seating areas are now enlarged You never could get past the bar if anyone was sat down and you still can t A standing area perhaps with a couple of those high tables would have been a much better choice  The beer selection is OK but Bathams will be sorely missed Overall I was underwhelmed and the features that made the old Waggon so characterful and distinctive have gone sadly It s smart but that s not what the Waggon was about  
neutral,Went here for a meal last Saturday evening Had read the reviews and was looking forward to it good meal The first problem was various dishes not available as was Campari to drink However we then had a 1 hour and 40 minute wait from arriving at the restaurant to being served our first course We were given no explanation for the delay until 10 minutes before our first course was served We should have bee notified on arrival of there was a problem to give us the opportunity to eat elsewhere The food when it eventually arrived was very good albeit very small portions  We did not bother with desserts or coffee due to delays and a lack of transparency from the staff Sorry out of principle I would not eat here again for fear of a repeat performance 
neutral, service was good prices are good The food was ok the pizza wasnt the best i have had but nice enough to go back Good for a decent meal 
neutral, Had a nice enough lunch here - food was pub grub The dinner menu looked good but quite pricey Staff friendly and attentive Cater well for families Good location close to the beach Pretty quiet but it was out if season 
neutral,It does what it says it s a carvery you get the usual selection of meats with the usual vegetables The choice is yours as to how much you eat specially if you like your vegetables Staff are busy but that s to be expected Otherwise it s a great for a family 
neutral,We ve eaten here many times but unfortunately things seemed to have fallen apart the last time  Staff were as friendly as always but the quality of the food wasn t up to it s usual standard No oysters - I notice another reviewer had this issue Food wasn t as well cooked or presented as we have experienced in the past  We probably will go back but if we have another below average experience it will be the last time sadly
neutral, Good choice of menu but lacking in atmosphere Service was ok but rather slow Food good and served by friendly staff 
neutral, This restaurant has been around for years  have dropped in a few times for a tasty burger well positioned in the town centre 
neutral,It was early Saturday evening and pretty quiet The food was good and the waiters attentive A couple of minor annoyances was that my Son s pizza was not cut and they didn t ask whether he wanted lemon in his coke They just poured it straight in It was only after leaving the restaurant that I discovered that there had been a 10 service charge added and my wife had left a tip 
neutral, We went for dinner over the bank holiday weekend This is an unpretentious local which was bustling when we were there - a nice atmosphere and the landlord and serving staff were very friendly and welcoming Not very smart and verging on the scruffy Food-wise the pub offers standard pub fare rather than anything particularly exciting or imaginative - chilli con carne fine but the special sea bass was disappointing Good beer selection 
neutral, Its pub grub pure and simple Well priced OK service OK food Value for money It gets very busy and tables are not cleared too fast and everything else seems a bit rushed Staff need more training some replacing to be honest Good for a quick low cost meal 
neutral, After the funeral at Alford crematorium the family had arranged a buffet at The Windmill Hotel This was nicely prepared and presented A selection of sandwiches savoury pieces and lovely gateaus were served Teas coffees as requested A lovely relaxed atmosphere for everyone to mingle and remember a very special person I cannot comment on the hotel facilities or the Indian meals but what we had was satisfactory 
neutral, We are regular foodies and have heard varying reports of this restaurant so wanted to make our minds up from our own experience When we visited it was not busy on a thursday night that said it is late shopping and I Was surprised at the lack of customers We were greeted and shown to a table about as far away from the food you could get directly under an air conditioning out let and freezing We moved tables and sat and waited and nothing no waiter no one after five minutes or so we got up to look at the food and were so disappointed never went back to the table just walked out and nobody seemed to care or question why Good luck and I hope your experience is better than ours 
neutral, We had an enjoyable family lunch here Whilst the dog ends still abound the front door the service  food and price are all good  Give the place another try and try to look past the shortcomings  
neutral, Our order was taken and the food arrived promptly The meal was very nice and there was enough on the plate to fill me up One minor moan is that it took the waitress a long time to bring us the bill after we d finished eating Otherwise no issues 
neutral, Food was really good different from most other standard indian restaurants However the service was slow other clients that arrived after us had finished their dinner before our food even arrived  Then part of it was burnt Service was poor we ordered two naans got just one Had to ask various times for some things like water or an extra plate that was missing from the laid table Drink portions were tiny but priced like regular drinks elsewhere The full dinining hall was incredibly loud due to bad acoustics design could hardly hear each other on our table It was either too hot or too cold when AC was switched on No spoons were provided to serve rice We asked for a jug of water but just got water in their tiny glasses but other tables did get jugs Bill was placed on our table before we asked for it 
neutral, We came on Saturday night a group of 7 of us after Akbars was too busy  The restaurant was reasonably busy but still lots of tables available  The food was really excellent Everyone really enjoyed their food and the service was speedy and professional except it was completely service without a smile The guy serving us was an older man and he was really efficient but just very cold No time for a smile or to make you feel welcome which was a real shame as despite the food being amazing and the restaurant being really nice we would probably not return as we just didn t feel at all welcome  Very sad as we are the type of group to return time after time to restaurants we like and when the bill came to just under 200 I assume that would be good business 
neutral, the place itself is really nice and greatly decorated the food is average and the drinks arent so bad however the atmosphere is completely dead nevertheless it was quite hard to find a waiter for service we were shocked that a place with not so many customers was finding it difficult to still provide service i may still try it once more but if it fails to provide again wont be returning 
neutral, Went with a group of friends on my recommendation and was rather disappointed Desperately wanted to enjoy the experience but it was frankly very ordinary I believe there has been a change of ownership according to their website and on this showing it s not for the better Some of the dishes were a bit tired particularly my Char Siu and my friends Singapore Noodles The website says that they re now cooking using a healthier style with less additives  I don t want to be flippant but I think I d like the additives back please To balance the criticism the Crispy Aromatic Duck starter was fine and extra pancakes weren t a problem Portions were generous  The wine list was simply a joke The list itself was fine a good selection including quality French and Italian red wines as well as the usual new world offerings The problem was that they simply didn t have most of them In the end I had to ask the waitress to tell us which wines they did have rather than what wasn t available  On the plus side the setting in a Grade 1 listed building is lovely and the staff couldn t have been more friendly and attentive The cost was 30 a head including drinks which isn t too expensive especially for Burford  Maybe we just got there on an off day but this has been and could be much better 
neutral, Dined here with family The place is very friendly and a very good location just up from the Green in Southwold Service was very good but the food was a bit hit and miss I can understand how it has mixed reviews Our main course and dessert were very good but the starter was just a disaster prawn tempura  I would go there again as I think they are on the right track 
neutral, Good priced pub grub in a converted cinema The premises except for family section to the side are rather dark and a little dingy Good parking at the Rear in Essex Street  Free for 2 hours  Staff were polite and food served within 5 10 minutes 
neutral,Food great but portions are small if you do not have chicken for the price its a treat rather than a regular venue
neutral, We tried it out whist staying in a neighbouring B&B on a Sunday night The food was delicious we both had a roast but took forever to arrive which seems a bit of a shame given the restaurant was less then half full I found a piece of tinfoil in my food which the waitress or perhaps she was the manageress didn t seem overly concerned about  That said the Hungarian waiter was very friendly and coped very well with the awkward lady on the table behind us It s seems there are some management issues but the staff clearly work hard and go out of their way to make you feel welcome I d give it another go  
neutral, I cant say I was in total awe of the place  all in all  quite average I think the waitresses looked great and added a bit to the authenticity of the place Food was slow coming but was good when it did arrive It has a the chance of being something so much more without too much more effort Will go back again for sure but certainly wouldn t be a weekly venue for me 
neutral, The staff are very quick to remove plates and glasses as soon as a dish is finished  this doesn t make for a very relaxing experience 
neutral, Second visit when in London Great location just off Regent Street Good welcome and staff attentive Food very agreeable a touch overpriced and the wine too but it s London  Don t think Piccolino s will disappoint but there is plenty of choice nearby so they have to keep on their toes to stay ahead of the pack Would we return probably 
neutral, Me and my partner chose to eat here when visiting Padstow I couldn t eat mine as the burger wasn t good and I rarely leave food let alone a burger  My partner had a fish which was lovely  The chips were cold but in the defence of the pub I overheard a man stressing that staff were off sick  Dog friendly which was lovely and nice quirky little pub to drink in no doubt I m sure there was some upstairs part but unsure 
neutral, After reading reviews I was surprised that the experience we had wasn t excellent Food was ok but there is much better customer focused cafe  bistros in Norwich 
neutral, Not having been here for quite some time Not much to shout about wait not to long Shown to table placed order Then told no Gammon Got our salad from the bar only to realise that there was no Cutlery to eat it with Not a great start  
neutral, I d just found my evening accommodation at a fishing lodge and needed something to eat I saw Pizza Express near the car park in the centre of Bicester but thought I d explore a bit before eating Sure enough there was an independent Italian restaurant Having been seated I was finally served my drink and totally ignored Yet there were only 12 people in there 5 minutes later I was on my way back to Pizza Express It took just 30 seconds before a genuinely friendly waitress welcomed me and showed me a table 3 courses and a glass of white set me back 26 50 including ice cream which tasted of real chocolate and real vanilla A very predictable meal with no surprises Why didn t I leave a tip My salad came served on a warm plate It was June When the waitress asked if everything was all right I mentioned my preference for a cold plate with a chilled salad She told me she would mention it to the Chef - leaving me to reflect that as she had brought it to me she must have felt that the plate was warm 
neutral, Had some light bites for lunch here recently baguette and a kids meal the portion sizes were average and the quality average for a chain pub like this If you ve gone to similar pubs before you know exactly what you re going to get 
neutral,I have visited on several occasions and it s difficult to sum up I have had some good experiences particularly the Sunday carvary but also some dreadful ones particularly when waiting for 45 minutes only to be told they d lost my order 
neutral, Stopped here for lunch by chance when looking for a nearby 4x4 distributor so opinion not swayed by the mixed reviews on TripAdvisor for the Hotel part of this inn Pub has a traditional look which is fine but that shouldn t stand in the way of freshening everything up a bit - it is amazing how many pubs still appear to have smoke-stained ceilings years after the smoking ban came in -the male toilets in particular were pretty shabby Not suggesting that they change image just try harder with the cleaning and maintenance and give the place a lick of paint occasionally Lunch-time food menu was quite extensive something to suit most people I would have thought My partner had the fish-cake starter as a main course after asking the waiter how big the fish-cake main dish was - it was the right choice as the portion was more than ample My Caesar salad was also a very good portion size with plenty of well-cooked and tasty chicken although for the purists there may have been a few too many non-traditional ingredients The staff were pleasant and attentive service not exactly speedy when there were few customers but within an acceptable time for a leisurely lunch With a drink each the total bill was under 25 so nothing there to grumble about - food would have got a Very Good but the shabby d€÷cor reduced overall score to an Average 
neutral,We arrived dead on time as we often do to be told that the restaurant was running a little behind and would we mind waiting at the bar for ten minutes If you know me you don t  you ll be well aware you re not that the bar is my home from home and this news came as a great delight As ten minutes crept towards fifteen and many subtle hand gestures and less than subtle come-hither looks in the barman s direction later we were finally blessed with two glasses of unspectacular but very drinkable red wine  As fifteen minutes approached twenty a waitress informed us that our table was ready and offered to carry the wife s glass to the table before her I was more than capable of carrying my own apparently Bit sexist  We ordered our starter and it was aMEZEing Plus it only took the staff 10 minutes to realise we might need some glasses with our bottle of tap water Being well dressed respectable sorts we were hardly likely to swig it from the bottle like a pair of Neanderthals  For the main I ordered the duck but I was dreaming I was dreaming of the steak She ordered the ravioli and the realisation that I no longer love her hit me like a heavyweight s uppercut  Minutes after the mains had arrived the apologetic knife and fork man made his first and only appearance of the night  How do you expect them to eat without their knives and forks  he barked at the waitress He then set our cutlery down Incredibly he intuitively knew that we were both left handed despite it coming as news to the both of us One job knife and fork man One job  In all the food was very good - the only qualm I had was that the right hand side of my mashed potato was under seasoned However the left hand side was doubly salty so it all evens out The ravioli In the face of such blank and unaffectionate glares I dared not to ask  The cheeseboard was the cheeseboard That s really all I have to say about that  All in all a silly and clumsy night customer service wise However it had a certain indefinable foolish charm to it The hapless staff though most notable for their haplessness seemed like a bunch of jolly good eggs and the food was not half bad It was half good  Oh and a special mention for the incredible candle rotation they have going on Throughout the evening we were treated to no fewer than four different candles Ruddy marvellous 
neutral, We popped in for a quick meal before we headed off to Wymondham for a theatre evening The staff were friendly and helpful The atmosphere pleasant with a large fire spreading a warm and pleasant feeling There were four of us and me and my wife had a vegetable curry dish I thought the parsnips were slightly undercooked but my wife was happy and liked them a bit crunchy  One of our friends had chicken and he loved it His wife had a Haddock dish fish cake and she was very happy too All together with one glass of wine and 1 1 2 pint of Adnam s Broadside the bill came to 50 which we thought was acceptable They didn t charge for my glass of tap water 
neutral,Group of 7 of us went for a birthday meal here on a Saturday night food was great and the cocktails were nice Although a lot of ice  Only problem was the service food took a good 25-30 minutes for our food Good atmosphere if you don t mind a bit of noise Definitely try and get a seat outside as the fold away metal roof is pretty cool
neutral,I did ponder for a bit before calling the three star rating because on paper it seems a bit damning especially in the context of a raft of 5 star reviews recently and we went this weekend so I d like to start by pointing out I don t think 3 is bad it s just average which to be honest reflects my overall experience and that s also with consideration to other 4 and 5 star experiences I ve rated  The restaurant seemed to be buzzing and I was a little disappointed to end up at a table in what seemed like a quiet alcove with about 4 other tables in there I didn t get to grips with the layout of place to work out if it was all like that but it just felt a little out of the way Perhaps I could have said something to get another table but tend to go with what I m given At the same time I can completely see if you don t speak up you don t give anyone the chance to address the point  We went for the sharing menu and of the 3 mezes we particularly enjoyed the fig and ricotta salad the texture of the cheese was lovely and the flavours all married together very well I also enjoyed the colour and tastes of the beets potato and parsnip spiced rostis For main I chose the coconut curry and while the flavours were all there I found the texture a little claggy for my liking The accompanying crunchy fresh papaya mango and cashew salad got its crunch from copious amounts of celery - just about the only vegetable I really don t like It may or may not have changed my choice I might have asked them to hold the celery but as a big part of the salad surely it s worth a mention on the menu  I did try and have it but a few mouthfuls and I just picked it out in the end  I was pretty full at this stage but the assiette of chocolate was delicately presented and delivered a range of chocolately treats without overfilling at the end  Service was slow That s something I rarely encounter as I enjoy a laid back unrushed evening as much as the next man but it did drag not the night or the company   but the flow of service to the point where we were sat with empty plates and empty glasses longer than I would normally expect to have to Partly this was due to the newness of the waiter I m sure and he was a lovely guy I just think he will benefit from some time in the role to settle in and scan for signs menus closed means we re ready to order empty glasses probably means we d like to be asked if we want another drink and perhaps a more experienced fellow staff member could keep a watchful eye out and help with that learning process It did feel like there was a nice vibe amongst the staff and I probably could have brought any of this up there and then and it would have been met with courteous consideration but I didn t want that to define my night All in all we were in there almost two hours where an unrushed meal of that nature would generally take about 90 minutes in comparison to similar evenings  I m deliberately calling out these things in a picky way because this is a review site after all and I genuinely hope the feedback will help I still had a fine night out just that it happened to be a bit more middle of the road than other reviewers experienced 
neutral, Great service lovely staff very welcoming Food is OK but it s SO expensive It s not worth the money 
neutral, The starters came out and were very nice unfortunately things went downhill from there When the mains arrived the starter plates had not been removed and so we had to pitch in on the waiting front We all had burgers which were cold with cold onion rings and cold fries Also no vinegar or HP sauce We were on two tables and unfortunately the two tables didn t arrive at the same time and there was only our party of 10 in the whole place  The desserts arrived and they were still frozen If the service could be improved a bit I think the place could be top notch 
neutral, I visited in the last week and it was suh quiet night that a member of staff invited our party through to the restaurant before the booked time It is a charming building with a nice atmosphere albeit there were only about 8 diners max that evening Our waitress was charming but not very clued up didn t remember who had order what and failed to top up glasses form the wine in a ice bucket out of our reach No condiments until we asked for them although there were some on other tables so it wasn t house policy  Food was nice but not wow fabulous the smoked salmon starter was perfect in consistency just not as much flavour as I expected The steak however was spot on for a medium steak but the accompanying vegetables were few and not very flavoursome the sauce on the potatoes was ok but didn t add much  If I had been paying I would have been more disappointed As it was the company was great but the service wasn t up to scratch and the food was mostly good but as other reviewers have noted quite bland 
neutral, Had a Christmas meal at Haz Restaurant for 9 The service was good and speedy The food was prepared well and tasted good We ordered from the set Christmas menu which had 3 different options at different prices All in all a good dining experience but tilted slightly on the pricey side for what you get 
neutral,This was not our first time at The Architect but it seemed not as good as previously The beer was still excellent and the wine was quite acceptable but the food was a little disappointing a couple of small bones in the fish fillets and the rump steaks were a little chewy 
neutral, I have previously written in glowing terms about the Queen at Dennington but it seems to have changed and not for the better I had won ton dumplings as a first course Whereas the Chinese steam won tons these were baked and crisp and did not have much flavour My main course was plaice which was seriously overcooked A friend had risotto which was good and two others had fish and chips which they liked although the portions were enormous Tiramisu was on the dessert menu and I was able to place this one in the top 20 of my world survey of Tiramisu 
neutral, We were a party of over 20 From the Christmas Menu I had Prawn Cocktail Lamb & Apple Pie Yes I am over 65 I have had many Prawn Cocktails over the years and this was the worst I can remember I do not think some shredded lettuce with what I can only describe as bits of prawn on top with a zig zag of sauce is acceptable unless the aim is to save money The lamb was good but the vegetables very plain but acceptable Those who were served first had to wait for the vegetables until we all had our main course luckily I was one of the last Things looking up until the Apple Pie and custard The pie tasted good but the pastry was     as if it had been micro waved Drink prices were acceptable for a restaurant Staff tried their best to cope with a large party As the restaurant is divided into sections I could not count the number of diners however in our section there were only 1 couple I understand that this restaurant is attached to the Highland Restaurant in Broxbourne which I have frequented many times over the years Perhaps I was looking forward to the same food and was simply disappointed 
neutral, Really Great Value for money full of taste  great staff and a pleasant the service is fast and there is no waiting around these people no how to look after there staff  i shall return 
neutral, Great english waterfront olde worlde pub so ambience great Good selection of beers and wines Menu however has been shrunk in content so not a great choice For a waterfront restaurant I expect fresh fish on the menu and the only choice was fish and chips not exciting The fish was fresh but neither cod not haddock and had little taste This was our third visit so after 3 mediocre meals I decided to make this review 
neutral,My girlfriend and I visited the Hogget for a nice meal out after reading good reviews online The ambience in the pub is nice - it was quiet when we first arrived but filled up nicely during the night The serving staff were fairly busy throughout the night but still had time for us if we stopped them - perhaps a little more attentiveness would have been appreciated  The food itself was nice - my girlfriend had a nice fish dish whilst I had the burger which was tasty but a little dry The real ale was good including a good Rugby World Cup Special  We might return here but with plenty of other pubs to try nearby it won t be top of the list 
neutral, Not a bad pub Three ales on tap and good service The asian food was quite nice Nothing wrong really just lacking a little something I suspect it would be quite popular with students as it is reasonably cheap the serving sizes are huge and it has a cheerfulness about it  Nothing wrong necessarily just not enough standout qualities to rate 4 stars 
neutral, Went here couple of months ago with friends wasn t impressed reserved our seats got there on time and had to stand up for half an hour to be seated Once we was seated ordered food it came i had lasagne and chilli garlic bread as a starter food was average at best Best part was the chilli garlic bread Much prefer Spaghetti House in the same area 
neutral, Disappointed with the food and offhand service compared with previous visits The food quality varied depending upon the choices made by the ten guests in the party 
neutral,Food was ok but the greeting from the landlord was pretty grim Very dour faced Not a place to go to for a smile well he did smile when I paid the bill Not going back not at all 
neutral, We went there for an evening meal and ordered our drinks first My wife had a lemonade my son a pint and we ordered our meals We wanted the special deal a meal for 2 with a bottle of wine for 20 The lemonade and beer arrived but no wine I asked the waitress where it was and the reply was we haven t got any red wine  A discussion with the boss found that there were several bottles of red just no Malbec left Food was good but please train your staff more 
neutral, I found the service to be efficient rather than friendly with our food arriving with little delay The decor is a little dated with very bright lighting The food was excellent with good portion sizes presented well and tasting exactly as it should do 
neutral,Went for a late lunch with the family on Christmas Eve We had a look in the nearby Wetherspoons but there every table was taken so we decided to try this restaurant which we had been to once before in the evening and not been impressed with but I would never condemn a place on the basis of one poor performance It was a mixed bag We arrived and despite the restaurant being less than half full a product I suspect of the poor reputation the establishment has gained since opening  were told that he would have to wait 5 minutes for a table and up to 40 minutes for our food No problem though we would have a drink from the bar first I noted before that if you had to wait for a table there was nowhere particularly to do that This situation has only been changed by the unpopularity of the venue meaning we could sit at a table near the bar The bar is somewhat limited 4 bitters two of them McMullens 4 lagers we noticed they didn t stock J2O s I selected McMullens AK which was okay if uninspiring I was there with my partner and our 2 teenage daughters I note that all three had difficulty getting off the high stools at the table near the bar After a few minutes we were shown to a booth The delay was even harder to explain when the waitress had to wipe the table for us Why the 5 minute wait menus were ready waiting for us The restaurant has a pizza oven and a griddle which seems to dictate it s menu options The children wanted starters and we chose garlic mushrooms and chicken wings with a barbecue sauce For mains my partner and I chose steak my oldest a penne dish and my youngest rotisserie chicken The starters arrived rather slowly considering it had emptied even more in the meantime The mushrooms were supposedly cooked in a garlic and cheese sauce and came with dough balls They arrived in a skillet on a wooden platter with the doughballs on the platter It s a simple dish which makes it puzzling why they couldn t do a better job when not under pressure The doughballs were burnt on one side and the mushrooms were covered in a cheese sauce of a very strange consistency with no hint of garlic once you removed some of the mushrooms it was apparent that there was a pool about 1cm deep of oil in the bottom see photo  The chicken wings were simply cooked in an oven with a dish of barbecue sauce on the side It was adequately done but then it required no cooking ability whatsoever Within an acceptable time our mains arrived I had asked for my steak medium-rare and was pleased with the chefs effort at this I do find that chefs often have difficulty with this even though it should be simple My steak wasn t the best quality but was thick and when I cut into it released a little blood onto the plate I know some people find that horrible but it s the way I like steak I had a mushroom and stilton top to this bizarrely it came in a little jug and consisted of small whole mushrooms in a stilton sauce which was very nice My oldest enjoyed her pasta it came without cheese as requested but again there was little garlic and with olives should have been in the singular My youngest reported that the rotisserie chicken was very dry but I accept that this is partly a product of the cooking process chosen In summary I enjoyed my main course but there was something to criticise in virtually everything else The service was slow for the number of covers being ordered but front of house were certainly adequate I think the impression I took away was that the organisation had reduced staff possibly because of falling sales rather than address the problems which have been highlighted in reviews on here Would I eat here again Maybe but I think the only reason this place will survive is the lack of competition in a small town I don t think it would fare well in a city 
neutral, as stated food not bad but bad customer service whats up with wroxham it used to be a lovelly place family friendly and don t use barnes barn craft boats dirty management anti people 
neutral, Slightly disappointing in that while the fish and chips was excellent the topping on the pzzas was rather sparse for the money I had the duck which was really tasty and well cooked but not a lot of it 
neutral, I visited this restaurant with my girlfriend last week We were very much looking forward to our meal after reading previous reviews We were greeted on arrival very pleasantly by front of house and shown to our table which was nicely set in the restaurant which is an old converted cinema The young lady who was our waitress for the evening was very pleasant and took our order efficiently Some of the food was very nice but other parts were average I had the rump steak for main which was nicely cooked but the home made chips were probably the worst I have ever tasted and were drowned in salt The peppercorn steak sauce was also not particularly tasty I did actually explain after leaving the chips that I didn t enjoy them when the chap form front of house asked me if everything was satisfactory He was very helpful and told me that he would remove them from the bill however when it came to pay the bill I was then told that because the chips were part of the steak dish they could not be removed  The atmosphere and setting of the restaurant is very nice but myself and my girlfriend agreed that we had experienced much nicer meals for a lot less money 
neutral, All regular from frosen seafood carrots onion and tastless bell peppers Not exciting 
neutral, Called in for lunch whilst being shown aroun Exeter Quays Inside tables were busy and as it was sunny we sat outside Service was good and there was a good range of drinks & food on the menu I ordered the ham sandwich will 2 in our group had the smoked cheese and chutney I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and the bread was lovely However both who had the cheese though that the smokiness of the chees was overpowering and ruined the sandwich Sitting outside was pleasant until a pneumatic drill opened up on the premises next door We finished quickly and left  So a bit of a mixed experience 
neutral, Popped in for a meal with my 7yr old grandaughter & wife and we were not dissapointed We didn t have to wait long before we were approached by Lynda waitress who did a superb job of looking after us The meal was excellent value for money  32 11 for two main meals and two rounds of drinks and we will be returning 
neutral, Nice city pub just across the road from Waterloo station can get busy but a good choice of ales await you Large screen tv s for sport are dotted around the pub if that floats your boat Food is good basic pub grub If you are delayed use this place rather than the overpriced rubbish in the station 
neutral, We went for a family Sunday lunch to the Ashcott Inn On arrival the restaurant area was very cold but nice and the table was well laid out There was a good selection of food on the menu and we placed our order The food did take quite a while to arrive and when it did it was served in several stages with no effort being made to collect the menus which had just been left all over the table The Pork meal was served without the apple sauce and was swimming in luke-warm gravy and the bread sauce failed to arrive with one of the turkey lunches ordered I had opted for the Turkey lunch but the stuffing that came with it was stone cold I did complain to the waitress who apologised and took my food away I waited quite a while for it to be returned and this time my stuffing was nice and hot However it would appear that whilst they were waiting for my replacement stuffing the rest of the meal had been left to cool down and was now only luke-warm Several other meals were also served with cold elements The menu for the Turkey lunch also stated  with pigs in blankets   but it should state  pig in a blanket   as I only got one very small one as did the rest of our party We did select Desserts after our main meal and we waited a long time for these to be served In fact they were only brought out after we queried where they were and in total we waited over half an hour Also in the disabled toilet there were no hand drying facilities and although this was brought to the staff s attention nothing was done to rectify this After reading so many positive reviews on Trip Advisor regarding the Ashcott Inn I can only say that our visit there was a real let-down and very disappointing We will not be rushing back in the near future 
neutral, Booked and arrived for dinner with friends at 8pm Friday evening Very busy always a good sign but unfortunately our table was not yet ready It happens no problem We were invited to have a drink at the bar this restaurant is not set up to allow for people to stand and have a drink at the bar there simply isn t the space Another booking turned up and was forced to wait in the doorway until we had been seated at which point they then squeezed into the bar area   Seated and the table had obviously been cleaned however the tablecloth was soaking again made aware to the waiter and was dealt with swiftly and effectively The waiters were very friendly and gave a great detail on the dishes on offer they seemed to know what was being served and made some good recommendations  Starters served in a reasonable time as were the main courses the food was fantastic we all tried each others dishes and no one was disappointed Unfortunately the service began to falter we had to ask repeatedly for drinks on several occasions and when asking for the bill had the same experience The bill was delivered and despite the restaurant being much quieter by this stage we had to ask a number of times to actually pay All in all great food and the service started well just a shame it wasn t seen through and when leaving we got the feeling they were glad the evening was over rather than the warm welcome we received upon arrival 
neutral, Great location good service and a good carvery but on my last 3 visits the beef has been very tough Stick to the turkey or go somewhere else 
neutral, Made a takeaway order from here in May  General selection of starters got lamb chops and a chilli chicken dish for main  All reasonable quality - lamb was a wee bit tough but the flavour was there  Chilli chicken dish looked full of food coloring and was- chilli powder hot as opposed fresh chilli hot but thats the only mionor complaint really  Service was very quick and came with a little party pack of wet wipe toothpick and chocolate which was a nice touch 
neutral, They tried to recreate a Brazilian atmosphere in Sheffield which is nice Unfortunately the meat prices here in UK are not compatible with a full rodizio service with unlimited fresh ramp steaks for everybody for example making some cuts to be a bit dry not freshly cooked on grill  I went in a Sunday roast lunch with only 7 cuts So could be a bit of unlucky Anyway A nice experience if you like beef otherwise it would be a bit expensive About the salad bar the best feijoada so far in UK Far better prepared than the cuts made me remember Brazilian food 
neutral, This is a typical Morrisons Cafe The food you get is pre-packaged frozen and there is little freshly made so the quality is much the same as any other supermarket cafe Breakfasts are the best value lunches are ok and light snacks and sandwiches are cheap but fine as a filler The problem I have with this particular cafe is the staff As with most Morrisons you order at the front of the cafe wander past the sandwiches and cakes and pay at the end of the counter At this particular cafe it s very hit and miss whether the order point is manned or not I have stood there sometimes for 15 minutes before a member of staff appears only to be told order at the till  Why dont they put a sign out to tell you this  I always buy a black coffee here and recently noticed there are two machines serving black coffee One is 1 29 and the other is 1 39 Upon reaching the till on this particular occasion I enquired what was the difference between the two coffee s only to be greeted with a very smug member of staff who happily informed me  the price   what a smug little git   Now if this were a new member of staff or a scruffy straight out of school oink I could understand it but this tall giraffe-like male has been there for some time Last week I stood at the front of the queue and was served by the same `oink` This time despite a large queue of people behind me he suddenly and without saying a word walked away from the till towards the kitchen I stood there for 5 to 10 minutes wondering what was going on along with the rest of the ever growing queue before he returned and carried on as if nothing had happened no explanation no apologies nothing  This man is rude smug obnoxious and a pain in the proverbial He looks as if he doesn t want to be there and makes that fairly obvious The other members of staff have a similar attitude and approach although he is the worst offender  Surely it is up to the manager to ensure the till s are manned at all times and although the food is of average standard this is no excuse for customers to be treated as `average` people  we re not cattle The food is ok the staff are lousy 
neutral, Decides to visit after reading tripadvisor reviews Place is well presented and menu options are good I had phoned in advance about a 50 percent off deal being advertised via discount apps on my iPhone and found the same offer advertised on their website They said its no problem and mentioned nothing else On arrival I confirmed that we had the booking with the discount only to be told we needed to come on a Monday or Tuesday which has not been advertised on the app or mentioned by them when we booked for that evening 1 hour in advance  We were immediately irritated by this and the excuse given was that we needed to have a taste card with us or come again on a Monday or Tuesday This is amazingly silly and does not make for a good impression at all we decided to stay none the less The food came and one pizza came without a topping as advertised It was quickly resolved with a generous side portion of rocket  The rest of the meal went well the bill came and of course without any discount  Service charge has already been applied at around 12 percent or so we gave 3 twenty point notes for a 56 pound bill only for the waitress manager to immediately enter entire amount into the till and carry on with her work Amazingly rude and unprofessional There was no way we were paying around 20 percent top given we had initially expected to take advantage of their 50 percent off deal and the service reall wasn t good enough to justify any more than the obligatory 10 percent So we had to awkwardly ask for our change A really sad experience given the reviews In all honesty I think the main issue was the relatively low quality of English spoken by the staff which led to a number of small mistakes and confusions Nevermind   
neutral, Had a Tesco voucher to use so called in early in the evening We used the early menu two courses for about 11 We were attended to by the waitress and we re pleased with how she dealt with us The two starters were value for the money  I ordered the bacon salad which the wife had as she didn t like her smoked salmon starter wheni it arrived We had the chicken and chips for a main course but unfortunately we did not read the menu sufficiently and didn t realised it came flatten with bread crumbs Our fault Place was quite empty probably due to time of year and time of day Unfortunately we were not that impressed with the choice on the main menu and will not be returning until we can see a better choice on the menu 
neutral, Went for dinner with a large group and while they generally coped well with the number of meals the quality of the food was rather mixed The majority were extremely happy with their food particularly the lobster however the steaks were very problematic The taste was excellent however both were extremely underdone - one that was meant to be medium was closer to blue and both were extremely chewy and difficult to cut I ve always had great meals here in the past so hopefully this was a blip and I will certainly be back 
neutral, We have visited many times over the years improvements have been made new kitchen ect The meals are good but the tables are cramped and very sticky for the Real Ale people this is possibly a plus but for people having a meal it s a bit off putting 
neutral, After an initial excellent visit to the Dairy Maid with friends a couple of months ago we returned with my Brother and Partner who are over from New Zealand We chose Censi s as we left it too late to get in Fresco s or The Colosseum  Teignmouths other Italian restaurants  We booked a table upstairs and very nice the newly decorated place looks too but that is a far as the good goes Two out of the four meals were average and the Pizza really bad We shared Bruschetta as a starter which as another reviewer has commented on was soaked in oil with large chunks of garlic distributed about it The main meals were Carbonara which was described as gloopy risotto which was tasteless plus a pizza which is new on the menu and was just awful Fortunately my Marco s tagliatelle and chicken special was really good as it was on my our first visit  I do not like leaving bad reviews but Tripadvisor cannot exist only on good reviews and we did write to the restaurant letting them know that the food offered the previous evening was not great Up until now we have not heard back from them which is another disappointment  If I were visiting Teignmouth and wanted dinner in an Italian restaurant I would go to either Fresco s or The Colloseum both of which are excellent I will be keeping an eye on the reviews for Censi s to see what the general consensus is re their pizzas If I were them I would take them back off the menu as they are a real letdown  If however they improve we will be back because apart from anything it is handy for the the new theater and the excellent bar The View within it 
neutral,This being the first place I came across when visiting chester appeared rather trendy from the outside however the story was to be different inside Upon sitting down the place felt claustrophobic almost as if it was trying to cater for too many people at once the seating almost bumps in the adjacent tables seating on one such occasion my partners chair was nudged buy another customer squeezing past The food that was ordered was ok but it didn t seem to really have the WOW factor that was expected The visit was made particularly unpleasant by the noisy barrage of buses and the occasional hint of diesel fumes that enter in when the door is opened and closed The decor is the only real area that doesn t fault It was an unpleasant trip and I shall be seeking other places in and around Chester to eat 
neutral, Arrived at a rapidly filling-up restaurant for a reserved lunchtime table Hurriedly shown to a table by a waitress who rushed off to the kitchen to bring out food for another table 10 mins later we were given a menu just as we were contemplating leaving and a drinks order taken Another 10 mins passed before the drinks arrived again just as we were contemplating leaving but no offer to take a food order which was taken by the boss a few mins later  Entire restaurant served by two inexperienced and frankly scruffy waitresses Young barman kept coming I asking for coffees from the big silver machine for bar patrons the girls had to deal with that as well as serve the entire restaurant on their own  The food took another half an hour to arrive but when it did it was pretty good Not outstanding but not too bad either Portions were small for what they charged A small side order of petit pois came at 4 if you please  how much is a bag of peas  Overall impression was scruffy inexperienced overworked and panicking staff which spoilt the atmosphere Eating out should be about the entire package - and calm experienced and smart staff will enhance the experience for customers Shame all it would have taken was a bit more professionalism and an extra body and I d be giving them a much higher rating As it is I ll probably not bother going back as there are too many other good places on their doorstep  I d hazard a guess that their location on the main road to Sissinghurst Castle & Gardens means they get a lot of non-repeat customers and so they are not overly bothered by giving their customers a reason to return Locals will drink in the bar where they serve their pizzas Can t comment on that as I haven t experienced it but overall the restaurant just makes 5 10 
neutral, Firstly who am I to really judge a restaurant over its fine cuisine credentials I haven t been to enough of them to know what s good and what s not so good So writing this almost 4 weeks after the event should be a lot more of a sober assessment as what I remember should provide a good acid test of the restaurant s lasting effect Well I remember leaving the establishment satisfied as the two courses were enough for me and my friend I remembering the waiter babbling on in English with a very French accent about the soup and wine whilst introducing us to the menu I don t think I m a Phillistine but even an initial have you dined with us before question would have teed up the service to us nicely because no assumption should have been made about what we knew and didn t know about the restaurant and fine dining After getting a good feel from the website I would have thought carrying on that feel in the approach and service to the customers would be spot on Don t misunderstand me - the only thing I would actually mark them down on is the dimly lit restaurant as I have this pervasive memory of being seated in relative darkness But I also remember my cut of lamb being supremely succulent and tasty And as a representative of fine cuisine they did not disappoint in that regard at all However I haven t a lasting memory in the same way as I have with the few higher end restaurants that I ve experienced over the years so I ll stick with my average rating Besides it was the company that I kept that made the evening enjoyable as we laughed a lot at some of the shared observations we had Probably my partner in crime might view things differently but I stick with my final comment - room for improvement 
neutral,I took my daughter to this restaurant and we were really looking forward to the good as the previous reviews were excellent  The meal was nice but not spectacular the atmosphere was none existent as it really quiet the service was excellent I don t mind the price but think the food should reflect this and to be honest it didn t  Shame but I will try it again soon 
neutral, The Good Burgers are tasty and hearty with a limited-but-attuned choice of topping combinations The meat isn t overcooked nor is it mooing between the buns The fries are crispy hot and have just that perfect splash of salt to give them some added flavour  The Bad Now that Steak & Honour has a brick-and-mortar restaurant they need to move away from the street food van mentality that still seems prevalent in how they take and process orders There s no excuse for a gaggle of people waiting in front of the counter vis-a-vis Gwydir Street Hot Numbers when the van is serving out there Invest in a paging system that alerts customers when their order is ready Giving someone a ticket and stating  Oh it might be 10-25 minutes   doesn t cut it  The Ugly Part of the anticipation for S&H finally getting a restaurant was just that it was finally a restaurant A place to call their own and make their mark while also offering customers a comfortable dining experience Instead of creating a unique and enjoyable dining environment S&H s restaurant looks like a Mill Road kebab or chip shop Did the designer of Peri-Peri Chicken also design this place The tables look and feel like IKEA failures the walls are bland save for random pictures of people with burgers in their mouths the chairs wouldn t be out of place in a primary school recreation room the color scheme especially the stairs  is boringly simple and spartan  You have a restaurant now S&H it s not all just about the burgers and fries  All in all the quality of the food gives it the 3-stars It s a shame really because I ve been a frequent customer of the food vans at Hot Numbers & was hoping S&H would knock it out of the park with this new restaurant Instead they ve managed to do a boring corner kick that just elicits a polite applause 
neutral, A nice pub that I have visited twice on a weekend recently The place is decked out with retro feel old flea shop paintings PVC banquettes and concrete tables It is spacious plenty of elbow room between tables and ambient music was pretty interesting selection The menu was standard revamped pub fare - burgers hot dogs mac and cheese nice roasts on the weekend Good coleslaw sides For the type of business John Salt is the food was great good portion sizes not too expensive Beers we also in good condition A lot of local drafts on tap local from Camden for example as well as international in the fridge imported from Hawaii for example  However on both times I visited the staff were either really nice friendly and helpful and others were completely sour - as if asking for a drink was impossible But again this place is whatever you call it - a pub  bar or boozer The owners probably don t want moody bar staff but there is more than often one in every place A pity I wouldn t go here for a special meal or any kind of gourmand experience I would go again for sure for a Sunday Roast  hair of the dog lunch on a Saturday  after shopping on Upper Street for a rest or suggest to the boyfriend as a place to meet for dinner to get him to pay because he will like the beer and I find the place comfortable and nice to look at 
neutral, This is the second time I have dined at the Forbury Restaurant I have dined from the Market menu and the A La Carte and the food is really really nice Good wine menu and the restaurant looks great It all comes at a price though - they don t do the lemon sole in town  However there is something about the staff in there they are just not very friendly The first time I put it down to it just being a bad day The second time though and the experience my group experienced was just the same  I cant really put my finger on it other than to say they are polite but you do feel like you are causing an imposition of them each time they come and take your order A few more smiles and a anything else you need right now would just go someway to match the service to the price of the food  One other point I would make is if you book a table for later in the evening don t expect relaxed dining Our starter main and dessert came out quicker than McD s flips a burger We had gone through the three courses in under an hour 
neutral, went yeaterday for the 3rd time previous 2 occasions have been good so recommended it to couple who came with us got seated ordred wing sampler having said how good it has been before they arrive thrown on the table just put on a tray with some dip the chicken they came from must have been anorexic not much meat and half were cold all 4 of us ordered ribs and pulled pork meal love ribs waitress took order but came back to tell us they were out of ribs  at 4pm  we reorderes chicken and pulled pork meal and pulled pork meal 20 mins later chicken and pork meal arrived 15 minutes later and still awaiting the 2 other mains we asked the waitress who had to retake our order manager came over when the 2 meals arrived and told us we would not be charged for them whilst he was there we sent back the onion rings which came out cold meantime people were being served ribs which they had apparently run out of food ok service is crap      
neutral, We ordered from here for a quick lunch We purchased a cheeseburger each and chips Overall it was nice for something quick and easy However the staff could do with being a little happier 
neutral,The atmosphere is good The staff is very good But the food wasn t great Just average But expensive So was the wine which wasn t great either Paid 20 odd quid for a bottle of Picpoul de Pinet which was harsh I mean the wine I had sausage and mash Sausages were very nice but the mash was very dry and I mentioned it to the staff My good lady had a steak which she liked but the veg were also dry and slightly over cooked Overall nice place but they need to improve the food in order to justify the prices Lovely garden outside though and we might try lunch there in the summer 
neutral, The food was generally adequate although I ve had better hotpot in a little place in Manchester called The Rovers Return  The cheese was vile It looked and tasted like it had been hacked from the body of a decaying walrus They serve beer from a local brewery called Shires  It s the usual cabbage water stuff the bearded loons of CAMRA enjoy so much Not my cup of tea but I noticed an extremely drunken scotchman guzzling gallons of the stuff  The locals are as they say a rum bunch  I imagine the competition for the office of village idiot is very hotly contested  
neutral, The place was nice in the sunshine Food ok for a pub service quite rapid I wouldn t think of going here for anything special 
neutral,Having heard rave reviews I was expecting something great here In the end it was disappointingly mediocre For it s positives the burger was nice I love a brioche bun and the burgers were tasty and well cooked Less impressive were the warm not hot fries and the lack of sauces in the vicinity of my table Equally uninspiring was the milkshake For five pounds i wanted fresh strawberries mixed with nice ice cream What I effectively got was a small mcdonalds milkshake at 5 times the price For a modest double burger certainly not large by any stretch of imagination  fries and a very small milkshake my bill was 17  As other reviews have said value for money is not there and I think I would rather go to mcdonalds in future It may not do as nice burgers but the fries will be hot and the cost will be far friendlier to my wallet 
neutral, food decent enough very quiet and lacking atmos and staff couldnt wait to cash up and get home at 2200 on a saturday at least that is how it felt as a customer if i was hungry and passing i would eat there but i probably won t be so there we are 4th meal out last week  lucky or unlucky me at this type of establishment and sad to report 4th out of 4 not bad not good two s and three s but averaged up to three 
neutral, Having seen that Bombay Spice was rated No 1 for restaurants in sale our party of three just had to give it a try as we love the flavour and spiciness of Indian curries Bombay Spice is a lovely place to dine in clean tidy colourful very relaxing and with very efficient service We thoroughly enjoyed our popadums and chutney tray consisting of spiced onions a lovely mint sauce a delicious red sauce and the best chutney I ve tasted in years  However thereafter all food delivered was pretty tasteless One of our party had Sheek Kebab which was OK but the Vegetable Pakora was just two flat pancakes that were totally tasteless The Aloo Chat was similarly tasteless and we normally love Aloo Chat and Vegetable Pakora We hoped that the main course curries Shaslik Tikka Sizzling Balti Akbari Cham Cham and Lahori Sizzler Gosht would be an improvement in flavour but although the curry portions were very large they were totally lacking in flavour As for spiciness there simply wasn t any  not even on the Balti Akbari Cham Cham which carried a 3 chilli rating The food presented was definitely satisfying from a hunger point of view but the starters and main courses we had that evening were very disappointing from both flavour and spiciness viewpoints which is a shame as otherwise Bombay Spice looks a lovely place to dine Maybe we ve just been spoiled by the excellent curries we ve had elsewhere 
neutral,We were staying at the nearby Travelodge so used this pub for both our evening meal on the Sunday night and for our breakfast the next day On both occasions it was raining so no one was using the garden or the balcony yet unusually for a J D Weatherspoon s the place was almost empty on the Sunday night and even emptier on Monday morning Given the location we would have liked to sit upstairs to enjoy the view but on the Sunday night there was a small group upstairs listening to loud music and on the following morning as soon as we sat down at a table we were informed that the upstairs was not open  Both meals were fine but the pint of Abbot that I had on Sunday night was the worst I ve ever had so I guess that this is not a pub where you want to order real ale  If you compare this to a similar one such as the Electric Elephant on Margate seafront you have to wonder why one is well patronised while the other is strugling to attract customers 
neutral, We were hungry an required fodder but didn t fancy anything too heavy so we went for a lighter Italian menu avoiding pizza   We had a blueberry milkshake which was lovely and then a tuna salad and a tuna baked potato The food was very nice not too bad value and the restaurant was nice and clean Only down side why serve salad with no dressing and the lettuce was literally a leaf plonked on the plate No real thought to presentation That being said there was a half hour wait as they had obviously been caught out with the first real day of sunshine and were busy so maybe that explained the salad It was nice though and we would recommend this as a pit stop service ok food generally nice 
neutral, Usually good food at all times but last visit had appallingly slow service which when dining with a young family has awful consequences Then when food did arrive only two of four meals arrived 
neutral,Went here last night with a friend as he bigged it up was slightly dissatisfied with the long wait on being asked for a drink  Should that not be asked once I m sat  Beautiful decor and loved the atmosphere wanted to give 4* rating however the chicken was quite bland could do with a sauce  I gathered that they forgot the asparagus when taking the order as it didn t come out till we asked for it Was raw and only 4 pieces for 4 95 - basically 1 20 per piece wasn t impressed  Starter - the tiger prawns were fantastic I wanted to order dessert but decided against it due to poor sides  Will try again but not in a hurry 
neutral,We had quite a nice meal - family of four eating standard fare - two kids burgers one steak one pasta Quality was OK and value reasonable but very slow to come out which sort of spoiled the evening Could not be bothered to stay for pudding Waitress was nice and did warn that there would be a wait because they were busy I never understand that - do they expect to not be busy   Anyway a 1 hour 20 minutes wait for the food was a bit too slow for us 
neutral, We had had a rather exotic meal out the night before and were on our way home from a weekend away so a keep it simple burger didn t seem such a bad idea The recently developed complex of restaurants in Greenwich by the river includes this branch of Byron and of the riverside eateries it was the only one we hadn t tried Bit noisy as you might expect but friendly service and the food came fairly quickly although they were unable to provide my home made skin on chips because they had run out  Of course were these really remotely home made they could have simply made some more but no matter Trouble was the french fries replacement were incredibly bog standard I should have followed my son who had crispy courgette which were quite impressive reminiscent of tempura Very disappointed also when I saw the very standard looking bun Bread has improved massively in this country over the last few years so why can t an upmarket burger bar provide a bun that doesn t stick to the roof of your mouth Oh and my burger was cold Is that normal I ll have another in a couple of years an find out Maybe 
neutral,Pleasant surrounding and staff food was OK Be careful if you eat outside the seagulls knocked my plate and drinks off while both my wife and child were sat at the table other that we have enjoyed a few meals there 
neutral, We visited here as a family of 6 - two children and the out laws After being told our food would be a 45 minute wait we decided to stick it out as we were all hungry AND it was drizzling outside I ordered the salt and pepper squid which arrived after 20 minutes along with my wife s fish and chips After a few minutes of eating the chips which were cold  the waitress came back over and asked for my wife s food back as it was destined for someone else  I got stuck into my squid actually very nice before she decided that needed to go back too An hour after ordering the rest of the food arrived - as did my second squid It was obvious that we weren t the only ones disappointed with the service judging by the barrage of abuse the bar staff were getting from other hungry customers patiently waiting for food is there anything worse than being angry-hungry - I think not   London Inn you would ve got a 1 had the food not arrived hot and actually very tasty Sort your customer service out 
neutral, We were looking forward to fish and chips at Mark s having enjoyed our meal when we were last in the area a couple of years ago but have to say the fish was a disappointment tasteless and watery my wife had cod and i had the haddock but both pieces were not what you would expect chips were fine though wouldn t return sadly 
neutral,The photo is incorrect This is a little locals pub set in a churchyard on the outskirts of Worcester Good for a well-kept pint and simple wholesome food I agree with previous comments about the excellent ham egg chips 
neutral, Food and service was average We had the set dinner lamb and chicken main courses Portions were too small however meat was tasty Service was too slow the waitress who deal with us had no smiling face I thought she did not want any more customers when we got to the restaurant Dessert options were too limited for the set menu They can improve better  
neutral,I d like to give this 3 5 stars for this visit There was a lot to like and I suspect that we were a bit unlucky There was a very large group of young girls and I mean 8 9 year-old young which was a bit weird and *very* noisy Apart from them we seemed to be the only customers  There was only one person serving the owner I guess but no complaints about the quality of service Between the two of us we had 5 tapas selections pimentos al padrone bruschetta not sure of the Spanish name  whitebait calamari and kidneys in sherry The pimentos were really excellent Gia thought they were as good as any we d ever had The bruschetta was tasty The whitebait and kidneys were OK but the calamari were very disappointing  Portions were quite substantial That s one of the problems with tapas between two  Discounting our unhappiness with some of the food the meal was good value  We *might* go back but probably only with more than two people  Parking was a pain We found a spot in a side road 5-7 minutes away but only after driving around for about 10 minutes looking It s hard to know what evenings might be like 
neutral, Whilst it s great living in a village with it s own Chinese restaurant it s a shame that the food is often 2-3 more expensive per dish than others in nearby Wallongford or Didcot meaning it can be cheaper to travel to those towns and eat  There is an extensive menu and food quality is generally good As the villages only Chinese it is often busy and it does seem that service suffers when this is the case Certainly when we went it felt like an eternity between courses  and we had to chase up our drinks order 
neutral, Went last night and there was one poor guy serving about 30 people the wait for food was 45min there is just not enough staff on duty I left as i could not get served 
neutral,Took my other half on a date night after reading good reviews Place looks nice and was quite busy Our mezze starter was decent and the spicy hummous was tasty Unimpressed with the service No one really smiled or paid us much attention they weren t that busy  We were told to give them the nod 10 minutes before we wanted our main course I did so and our food arrived 20 seconds later Had it been waiting Just a bit off As was the service in general I wouldn t go back there for a romantic meal 
neutral,I forgot to mention that two of our party ordered a sweet that was on the blackboard to be told it was not available and the suggestion to perhaps remove the item from the board was not taken up for some reason altogether a disappointing evening 
neutral, staff ok lunch well had set lunch pate to start not bad next chicken never had so many bones in one meal 
neutral, For views going up the Shard etc 5* For a restaurant 3* The setting is truly stunning of course and we went on a glorious sunny morning for breakfast The menu is limited and we went for the safe bet of Eggs Benedict which was ok with good quality ingredients although the Hollandaise did have a skin formed where it had sat on the pass for too long Listen we went for the views we got the views As a destination experience of the Shard 5* 
neutral, Quaint idea for a pub but unfortunately far too small almost impossible to get a seat and overpriced 
neutral, One of the better Cote restaurants I have been to Overall my seven friends and I had an enjoyable evening here Service was attentive food tasty wine reasonably prices Well done Guildford 
neutral, I went to the Naked Turtle in Sheen a few days ago - on a Thursday night - with about 12 colleagues for a retirement dinner The venue looks good The music was lovely but then it went a bit downhill We were put into the conservatory on separate tables The barstaff was quite rude and the waitresses were not far behind on that score The food was average and overpriced The menu very limited It was very dark so it was difficult to see what one was eating Beware If you book as a group and some people don t turn up you will have to pay for their meal - company policy and it is on their website It was one of those evenings you regret I don t think it works as a restaurant as the set up didn t feel very professional to me Maybe better as a jazz bar I would certainly not go back 
neutral, Sandwiches tend to be nice however they struggle with larger orders Ask for no fat each time comes with fat  if you cant make without fat then tell me and I wont order 
neutral, Group of 10 of us for dinner We ate off of the 75 per head set menu The service was good and the food and was nice with some of the dishes being exquisite  The interior is modern and chic and well laid out However it is a little bit dark and very loud which gives it the feel of a night club  The overall experience was good but it didn t feel special enough for its Michelin star and the prices 
neutral, Arrived around 3 58 for afternoon tea having visited and enjoyed this Tea Room before welcome not as I would have hoped but in hindsight guess they wanted to close No chance of a sandwich as kitchen was closing whilst at the same time another couple were being turned away Ordered a scone and tea which was lovely albeit a little expensive Verdict disappointed with the Service which in a tea shop is so important Food always tends to be good but with other excellent establishments in the area will sadly probably go elsewhere - never understand why such establishments who employ a number of staff cannot show a higher degree of flexibility 
neutral, This used to be the hotel restaurant prior to the Pass opening and since then the value offered has declined whilst the content of the menu has become sterile and predictable like a Marco Piere White grill 
neutral,Lovely sunny Sunday and we felt a riverside bar and restaurant was the order of the day Alton Bridge Hotel our chosen venue for lunch and drinks outdoors  Arrived around 1pm drinks and sat beside the river in the spacious well equipped riverside garden Table pre-booked for 2pm lunch  Nice cosy interior bar and restaurant not large but nice and quiet Starter of soup was delicious and served with warm bread different soup to menu option but not a problem Dinners were brought to table while I was still eating soup starter no attempt was made to ensure we were ready for main course Main course - 2 Roast Beef dinners with all the usual trimmings I requested no garden peas and specified this to the young waitress sadly my dinner came with garden peas and I had to request my food was re-plated and returned minus garden peas This was promptly done but our Yorkshire puddings had to be requested for us both as they were not provided with either of our Roast Beef dinners Pepper pot on table had to be changed as this was empty too  Overall beautiful dinner very tasty nice vegetables and nicely presented but poor quality service by young waitresses let the meal down I would eat there again because food was nice and surroundings were perfect I just hope the management train staff better for customer service 
neutral, This was just ok Although it has a big reputation this place is just alright This place is ok if you have kids or want pizza and is the only nearby place 
neutral, Myself and my girlfriend visited this restaurant recently for an afternoon date The decor and service were second to none - really set the atmosphere for our meal Upon perusal of the Menu i realized the prices were fairly steep for the food they were offering We both ordered a starter which I could not fault - Garlic Flatbread and Pulled Pork Potato Skins The Main Courses however were a massive let down my girlfriend ordered a very impressive sounding Pulled Pork Chicken Burger which was very small and unimpressive indeed - my girlfriend commenting that the most impressive aspect of her meal were her fries  My main course of King Prawn Fajitas arrived very professional looking on a Sizzling Platter however my appreciation for the dish ended there The 10 prawns on my platter struggled to fill the 4 tortillas I was provided with which was disappointing for the 14 99 I paid Also the Prawns - although appearing they were cooked properly - were obviously not fresh as I was up all night after the meal with a very upset stomach We won t be hurrying back here 
neutral, If you need a quick take away for chicken or wraps this is a good place at the Aldersgate Food quality is okay as compared to the price 
neutral, Waited at the bar for a heck of a long time partly due to the massive orders people in front were making but also to a misjudgment of staff required Pulled a good pint and had very nice dog-friendly seating outside Food looked very nice although we didn t have any  I d like to go back to try the food 
neutral, visited on a Saturday night it was a very busy bar but we got served quite quickly The place seemed a little rough plastic glasses and my bottled beer had to be put into a plastic glass music was ok did not stay that long after this 
neutral,We arrived at 6 30pm and checked that we could be fed and away by 7 45 We were told this wouldn t be a problem - the restaurant was quite empty We ordered drinks and a main course The drinks arrived quickly but no food After waiting well over half an hour and seeing at least two tables who had arrived after us get their food we asked what was going on and were told that it was just coming  A couple of minutes later the food did arrive but by the time we had finished it was too late to order dessert and settled for a hastily downed cup of coffee It ended up being a disappointing experience - a shame because the food was good the waitress friendly and the setting was enjoyable But the food service was dreadful and ruined any relaxation that otherwise we ought to have enjoyed 
neutral, The food was quite good Highlight was the mouth-watering lamb grill and not too sweet manggo lassi Curry and lamb briyani was average I did not like the type of rice the restaurant used  Service was good The only annoying thing was four different waiters came to our table over a period of 20 minutes asking how the food etc  A very spacious and comfortable restaurant It gets busy on weekends so make a reservation because it is only the Indian restaurant in that area Reasonable price averaging about 12 per person without alcohol  
neutral, Upminster is crying out for a good restaurant like this they just need to change a few things and it could be great Food is mixed some very good but menu doesn t change They need more specials for greater choice and a better wine list some good wines - happy to pay a little more  A good start need to venture out now 
neutral, Before this restaurant expanded this was one of my favourites in Bristol great atmosphere delicious comfort food great service and fair pricing Since then my experiences there have unfortunately been disappointing The staff are friendly and helpful and the place still has a good atmosphere but the portion sizes are incredibly mean especially the desserts and the pricing is completely unreflective of what you get The tiramisu which we ordered to share was a mouthful of tiramisu that you could eat in one bite and the apple crumble was served in the same little saucepan used for the sauces to accompany the steak  un utter rip off given that it s 6 50 The soup of the day starter  4 95 was equally mean and the fish and chips was very average with a relatively small fillet of fish that was more batter than meat and a handful of chips The restaurant gives me the impression that generating maximum profit has taken over from serving good food and fair portions 
neutral, Food was very nice I had the Game Pie others in our party had the Staek & Ale Pie the Sea Bass the Chicken Duo and the Rib of Beef The Beef looked pretty amazing but everybody enjoyed their food  My mash was a bit stodgy so I asked for a little jug of gravy like the one served with the Steak & Ale dish sadly she forgot to bring it Like she forgot to take our order until I told her we were ready oh and I was charged for desert We never had desert  It wasn t me  Was the retort Hmmm ok In summary It s a nice atmosphere food is pretty good for the price if not a little expensive but I think we got the trainee waitress Won t stop us from going back though 
neutral, I m not big on name restaurants I ve been to a few most notably on of Rick Steins places in Padstow they usually come with so much expectation that they are hopelessly disappointing I m looking at you Ramsey  Carluccios was a better option being part of a chain that has a famous name attached Slightly different prospect Anyway we went in and was taken to a nice banquette by our waiter We d barely got the menus open when he was back asking us to order drinks As were don t really do alcohol we wanted to look at the soft drinks and we asked if we could have another couple of minutes He seems to be mortally offended by this and stomped off 20 mins later he finally came back to us after seating people either side of us taking orders and delivering starters to both sides all the while steadfastly refusing to acknowledge us  Disturbingly he was also flirting slobbering over the young girls on the table next to us He sidled into the space between table and bent over A lot There isn t much space between the table which meant that for most of lunch we had a waiters bum in our face Had it been a nice bum it might have been seen as a bonus and he might have got a tip arf arf  but as it was it was a rather unpleasant distraction  The food eventually started to arrive and the Chicken Liver Pate was exquisite The Milanese di Pollo not so  nothing wrong but it needed something with it other than salad leaves to make it fly The dessert a rum and vanilla panna cotta with candied orange peel was enough to make a grown man weep Once we actually got it  We were thanks to the ineptness of the waiter running out of time before our next appointment of the day so we ordered dessert and coffee together even having a bit of a joke about it and having a mad discussion on the difference between a single and a double espresso The dessert arrived The coffee did not The dessert was cleared away the coffee did not arrive After much flirting by the waiter again with the next table we finally managed to catch his eye And he somewhat sourly asks us if we d like to order coffee We already have done we equally sourly respond There s a brief moment of huffing and no you didn t  after which I remind him of the conversation we had about it  Oh yeah  he says and a full 25 minutes later from the second time we ordered it some 45 minutes from the first time we get the coffee Which it has to be said was awesome and possible the best espresso I ve tasted  But the whole meal which would have been hugely enjoyable was spoiled by a waiter who seemed to determined to put the concerns of the contents of his pants before the needs of the customer Plus y know I had a blokes backside in my face for nearly two hours Not the best advert I m afraid  ****Addendum I went back to the shop part of Carluccio s in Tunbridge Wells as I d seen some rather tasty looking Mortadella Being a mortadella fiend I had to get some Despite being the only person in the deli part it took 25 minutes to be served and then after asking for mortadella I was given first ham then mozzarella and finally mortadella The person serving although she was very pleasant to chat to eventually had absolutely no productt knowledge I might have asked for grated fruit bat given the blank look on her face when asking for mortadella  It sad when a potentially great experience is turned into something less than enjoyable and frustration but staff that don t seem to give a toss 
neutral,Everyone who goes to Bamburgh knows the Copper Kettle This time we called in and were definitely pleased with the outside patio area and the new toilets Inside though the overall feeling was one of tired decor and tired waitresses The cream tea was very good though 
neutral, okay pancake house good choice but okay pancakes at a high price for the food you get Maybe try again soon to see if it has improved 
neutral, Part of a large group  and the overall experience was not too bad If you want an intimate classy meal  this is not the place If you want amazing tasting food  again not the place If you want lots and lots of average tasting Chinese food this is it Prawn toast amazing  Duck pancakes poor Lots of choice and desserts pretty good 
neutral, The Bridge is of course in Clayhithe roman for clay harbour but the powers to be have condemned the place to the history books just like the very good specials boards that this pub used to have and made a visit worthwhile Even then it was a chain pub restaurant Chef and Brewer so why this option has stopped I know not  Having booked earlier we still had to wait at the wait here sign for nearly five minutes before being asked had we booked and then show to a table feet away It was not until about 10 minutes our drink order had been taken that we were informed that there was a delay of nearly an hour on cooking was this OK Given that it was now 8 45pm they were told its got to be as its too late to go anywhere else It took perhaps 15 minutes for our drinks too arrive Service was indeed slow  The food was disappointing in terms of range and portion size The range is now just the norm pub chain offerings and the portion size small  As time when on we got the feeling that we were not wanted and indeed our bill arrived in under five seconds of asking for it  Would we go again Perhaps yes but only because what was offered is a little better that other pub chain offerings  Overall disappointing 
neutral, Blimey All the good reviews this bijou little cafe has been receiving in the past including from me has made it a very popular place to go It continues to deliver but some aspects are beginning to suffer probably due to the levels of customers rocking up there At 9 15 it was almost full  This particular weekend it could have been mistaken for a Crufts Preliminary event  Dogs everywhere Even two being wheeled in sitting in a childs pushchair  Now don t get me wrong but a dog does NOT belong in a cafe  restaurant especially in pushchairs OR sitting on an owners lap eating off the table-top And willfully ignoring the NO DOGS IN THE DELI sign really takes the biscuit  NOT THE MANAGEMENTS FAULT I agree but I object to the intrusion into MY breakfast brunch by yapping slobbering and whining hounds that are not what I pay money to sit and eat amongst  I think the owners need to review this concession to dog owners  I must also regrettably report that elements of my Kitesurfers breakfast were not hot possibly not cooked long enough and my wife s Knickerbocker granola had Greek not frozen yoghurt so had become a bit cloying Hey-ho possibly again due to customer numbers putting stress on the kitchen staff who are normally spot-on with their offerings This is very unusual  However it won t put us off calling in for breakfasts that fill you up for the day in normally a very pleasant cafe by the sea all for a very fair price   
positive, Lovely atmospheric pub Good selection of real ales Knowledgeable staff re beers if a little patronising Excellent menu and specials selection Service - on a quiet Tuesday lunchtime - was bit like M&S cafes - very slow The food when it arrived was excellent with good sized portions They do speciality pies of which you can have a half portion 12 95 with all the trimmings I heard the barman say that a half portion of pie weighs about one and a quarter pounds + chips mash etc I think you would have to be very hungry 
positive, Last minute decision to eat out on Tuesday night - arrived about 9pm Wonderful fish and chicken pie main meals and excellent sweets Friendly and efficient service Natasha  Problems will IT system when it came to payment handled well 
positive, This is our second visit We like this restaurant it is a great addition to the Reigate restaurant scene  The food this has been generally faultless My wife is vegetarian so excellent food for both meat eaters and vegetarian guests  Service I have seen some very negative reviews on service It would be fair to say that the restaurant staff were keen to ensure service was good and overall the timings for service were good for us The staff had clearly read the reviews and were keen to ensure they got it right  What is beyond doubt is this restaurant is very successful particularly at the weekend so book a table We arrived early for our booking and were accommodated There is no doubt that the service team work hard at these busy times  On the subject of service I really liked the friendly service we received I think they have got a good team working here  Everyone will make up their own mind we however will definitely be back 
positive, If Chiquitos is providing authentic Mexican food  at 54 for two dining I struggle to understand how authentic Mexicans can afford to eat 
positive,Been 3 times now most recently for my birthday celebration a couple of weeks ago with 13 others Well organised good ambience waiters excellent and very tasty food my mouth is watering thinking about it  Despite changing the number of diners 3 times including when we arrived nothing was too much trouble and all was done without complaint A good way to dine here is to pick your starter we choses a variation on mixed kebab on a sizzler then let them cook for you Gorgeous The house wine was fine and not too expensive and at the end they ordered our taxis which arrived quickly Negatives away from the centre of town nowhere within 2 minutes walk for a drink beforehand that s all Will definitely go again soon 
positive,Train delays are not a problem in fact they are a blessing if you settle yourself down to lunch here I should point out that I love train travel so I love being at a train station waiting for train even if it is only going to Harlow Town So having a nice place to wait maximises that feeling The prices are what you might expect at an airport but that does keep out the day trippers so on a Saturday afternoon it was a quiet and relaxing place for lunch or just a beer I had the classic burgle and chips Though I am not a fan of meals served on old chopping boards the chips were nicely presented in a wire basket and well cooked The burger was char grilled and very tasty The beer was cold and there was a silent TV with sub-titles if you wanted to keep up with the Olympics 
positive, I went there on a team building night out It was fun and served its purpose I wouldn t recommend this four couples or people who don t like loud music 
positive, We arrived at Casbah on Friday morning We didn t know whether it was table service or take a seat ourselves staff must have seen us as they told us to take a seat and we ll be right over  We looked at the menus and found a good range of food and drinks But we had to wait around 10 minutes for the waitress to come over and take our order However when the waitress arrived she as extremely polite and apologised for the slow service and offered to compensate us with a beverage of some sort Our food arrived shortly Our Coffee s were just how we like them  The staff are really polite genuine people just need to pay a bit more attention to customers  Well done Casbah 
positive, Lovely steak with no gristle and good chips to go alongside Good basic food at a sensible price We sat on leather couches before going to the table to eat our meal 
positive, I ordered takeaway from this place one Saturday afternoon the food arrived within an hour  a reassurance that it was freshly cooked  It was delivered by a smartly dressed man in a suit to my door he was very polite  The rice was perfect the curry likewise a perfect mix of spice and heat very authentic and so filling Value was great also  Would recommend this to anyone who appreciates good curry  
positive, We went there for lunch just the two of us It was mid week and although there were a few other diners the staff outnumbered us by about 3 to 1  There was a great special offer - starter curry rice or nan and a side dish all selected from the main menu for a money saving 11 00 per person There are different special offers it seems every day and different ones most evenings  The food arrived quickly and was very tasty The portions were of a good size and we left feeling very full With a couple of alcoholic drinks and some poppadum to nibble until the food arrived the total bill came to a very acceptable 34 00  Good bits - the restaurant now has some outside seating - looks very smart - down side - overlooks the road and Earlswood Station Good bits - The lovely crisp clean linen and fresh d€÷cor inside - the downside - music was too loud aircon noisy and someone was using a drill while we were eating 
positive, Superb little place Have been here for Indian in the evening and breakfast in the morning Great food nice atmosphere and very good value Is a BYO license so don t forget your booze  
positive, A good carvery with tasty hot food helpful friendly staff Gets very busy on a Sunday afternoon but that s a good sign that it s worth the wait 
positive, After a busy day in London shopping we really wanted to find somewhere where we could chill out and we did The Old Coffee House is a lovely old London pub full of charm and character really old fashioned and homely nothing flash but you can relax and enjoy a drink or three and a good pub meal Food was served promptly and it was hot and fresh Nice old pub 
positive, Nice selection of food and very tasty Good name for money Drinks are a little expensive but that s restaurant prices for you 
positive, Having received a couple of recommendations we thought lets give the Fox and Hounds a try The surrounding village is beautiful the coahing Inns former stable yard now provides lovely outdoor seating However we had booked and the only seating available was in the cellar - don t get me wrong it has been converted in a comfortable dining area Passing the bar on the way to the cellar there were several Ales on offer - Real Ales -and the couple I had were much appreciated as they had been cared for One slight disappointment we had booked for a Sunday Luchtime and their menu ha changed such that some of the expected meakls had been replaced with traditional Sunday Roasts Don t get me wrong these were excellent - and I repeat my fellow guests comment here s well We all enjoyed the substantial and tasty food we each received We all came out feeling full not bloated but well and truly sataisfied I am just going to have to come back not on a Sunday to try the other Menu s in fact probably next week - and looking forward to it 
positive,My wife and I hadn t booked but turned up quite late ish on a Saturday evening We were given a table which to be honest looked to be in a part of the restaurant that was too busy we asked for another and were granted it It was busy very busy  a typical Italian waiters were attentive without being obtrusive We had two bottles of wine starters and mains the food was delicious especially my lamb shanks very sweet and tender Just generally good food and a good evening My only concern was that the toilets looked to be very basic To me if the toilets are clean then the kitchens will be  nothing worse than scabby toilets that needs looking at But other than that very very nice 
positive,Had lunch there just before Christmas Food and wine really good I can only say the atmosphere was average as there only a few people in at lunchtime It was the last Saturday before Christmas so everyone was shopping I have been here before in the evening and the atmosphere is great I thought it was good value as the paella for four was more than enough food The wines are excellent and the staff really helpful in choosing wine and food Well worth a visit
positive,Superb all round  My wife and I had a lovely meal here last night This was our first visit here The food was superb excellent menu choice and the service was very good too  The restaurant was very nicely laid out and we had a lovely evening out  We would definitely come back 
positive, One of those places that draws you back  the food is very good the staff are attentive but not in your face  Value for money is a byword here  One MASSIVE plus for us jolly Englanders is that they don t serve alcohol     But you can bring your own and they don t charge corkage   In a nutshell if you are in Wantage and want a damn good feed [ and you just happen to have a bottle or two upon your person] then trot along the Sylheti You wont be disappointed 
positive, The restaurant is tucked away in Covent Garde easy to get to Very comfortable bar with good range of drinks lots of work groups present and romance around So eight very happy people climbed the stairs for dinner good food very drinkable wine and brandy What more could an old man want 
positive, We had a really good night at MEAT liquor with some friends The burgers cocktails etc are genuinely very good and our waitress was friendly and helpful  It s dark noisy faux grungy and alternative and packed around the bar area but that s exactly what you should be expecting and consistent with how they market themselves Complaining about it would be like whinging about the lack of steak at a vegan joint  The only thing that stops it getting 5 stars is that you re paying a premium and queuing because of its considerable popularity 
positive, good food and drink clean and tidy pl enty of parking nice freindly staff 
positive, We don t often have German food and while I wouldn t want to make a steady diet of it what we had at lunch yesterday was delicious  The Bismark Herring starter was out-of-this world if a little on the skipy side in terms of the size of the portion The chopped liver was pretty damn terrific The Wursts were great and the saurkrout flavorful The service was a bit harsh and when we asked certain questions the answers were very brusk and rather unsatisfactory  It is Wurst you will need mustard  and a there were a couple of mistakes with the dessert order  two of them were forgotten  All that said I d still happily go back again 
positive, We had a party of 9 with ages ranging from 10 to 95 years old some of whom were quite demanding in their choice of food The environment was pleasant with various areas so there was the impression you were in a relatively small restaurant There was not the noise you can get in a restaurant with as many covers as this restaurant The wide range of Italian and English food met all our varied demands the quality was good the service was very polite helpful and prompt The prices were reasonable They did make a small mistake with the bill which was quickly corrected I believe it was a genuine mistake We would go back again 
positive, Nomu has a great atmosphere and truly excellent service The food is of a very high quality and I have enjoyed most items on the Japanese-inspired menu They have some surprisingly low-cost specials between 5 and 7pm 
positive, Returned to have a meal and had a lovely time Staff very friendly and accommodating for food allergy  We had booked with a livingsocial offer for the Friday night and pleasantly surprised by how unhurried everything was  that does not mean slow service Lovely seabass fillet 
positive, Nice beer garden with piped music soft rock  in a friendly pub with a choice of fine beers Does bar meals up to 4 pm although we never sampled them - they looked tasty 
positive, We had fish and chips that are a bit pricey  cost just under 25 for 2 and 2 waters but tasted great and served up in an historic building 
positive, Tasty main courses we opted for the 8 95 banquet offer The starter portions were smaller than I expected and were mildy spiced I wasn t too impressed with the kebab in the starter too much colouring and binding ingredients I think  I like my curries reasonably spicey and the main courses didn t disappoint We shared a garlic naan and pilau rice with prawn Madras and a mixed balti The balti contained pieces of the same kebab as we d eaten in the starter but the sauce masked its consistency and flavour  The waiter was very attentive and we had a good old chin-wag about food restaurants and travel A real pleasure to spend time with him He appreciated that our tastes were definitely in the authentic home made spiced and garnished to bits ball park  To sum up then main course made up for a bit of a slow starter and I d rate the restaurant at very good value for money Expertly prepared main courses demonstrated the genuine ability of the chef A lovely welcoming atmosphere and pleasing decor  Well done 
positive, Really nice environment with good selection of tapas wines and very pleasant staff Will definately be going back 
positive,Easily booked a table via their web site and arrived expecting the restaurant to be quiet on a Wednesday evening at 8 00 The opposite was true every table was taken and a number of people were turned away due to tables reserved all night A very popular restaurant so book a table in good time We had a short wait for our table in the mean time we were looked after by freindly and attentive staff The meal was lovely apart from a small problem due to personal choice which was amicabley resolved Highly recommend this restaurant but do book a table in advance 
positive, I visit regularly for a quick drink after work Staff are quite friendly Food is cheap and pretty good for what it is Something for everyone on the menu 
positive, The room was pretty good with a lovely view over the estuary comfy bed and everything worked and was clean  Restaurant was fairly limited on choice but I was happy with what I ordered It was a Monday night though so I can understand this  Breakfast was good and they even opened up early for me as I needed to be in a meeting by 08 30  All in all a very good value stay and I will be shunning the local Travel lodge and Premier Inn in favour of this place from now on  
positive, Spur of the Moment thing went for a Curry for tea Been here a few times actually my wife s favourite Indian  Staff very friendly and attentive excellent choice on the menu and it won t break the bank Food well presented and hot - oh and very good to Try the banquet nights on Tuesday or Wednesday for a fixed price - great value Recommended 
positive, This is a lovely little pub that has been cleverly refurbished to be trendy without being pretentious and still retaining an original characterful charm Food is great fresh and a good choice Staff are friendly and good selection of beers and ales  Great place for quiet drinks Sunday roast or to sit in the small courtyard garden area 
positive,Bilash is a great restaurant and my partner and I very much enjoyed our visit  The restaurant itself is very plain and simple in terms of decor but clean warm and welcoming The staff were welcoming friendly courteous and efficient  The menu isn t as extensive as you ll find in many other Indian restaurants -- their policy seems to be we ll stick to the few things we know we can do really well  However we both found dishes that we liked the sound of and I think there s enough choice to satisfy most customers  The food was served quite promptly and was very good indeed There s plenty of attention to quality and detail and my partner and I both felt it was some of nicest tastiest and most satisfying Indian food we d ever tasted Definitely a cut above the average  The bill came to over 85 which we felt was a little on the high side given that we didn t have much alcohol with our meal This is the only reason why I m awarding four stars instead of five Yes you have to pay for quality but even so there comes a point where the price seems surprisingly high  Overall a very good restaurant that we d be happy to go to again It would just be nice if they trimmed their prices a little 
positive, We had a table booked for 18 15 on Saturday 12th December for a family meal 5 adults and 2 children Most tables were full and ours was ready and waiting for us fully laid out with Christmas crackers and menu s We was attended to straight away to order drinks by a very pleasant member of staff and were delivered virtually straight away We placed our starter food order from a very varied menu and was delivered in a short while no complaints whatsoever The same for the main and the dessert no waiting hours just nice The children were asked if they wanted a child menu and were also offered colouring books and crayons The whole experience was without fault 
positive, On the four hour drive from Cardiff to Chester my wife and I stopped here for lunch My wife is coeliac Gluten Free Diet for medical reasons and it was really good to see such a well defined menu with lots of GF items for her to choose from Well done Brains who own this restaurant on the outskirts of Hereford The nachos were fantastic as a starter to share 
positive, Good food well cooked nice ambience pleasant staff There were six friends one couple looked after our dog whilst on holiday and this was a thank you They liked it 
positive, I knew about this pub from way back when it was the Mucky Duck & it had a bit of a reputation so we tended to avoid it but on a recent site visit they re having work done to provide a roof terrace I was pleasantly surprised to see that not only had a complete makeover it also brewed it s on beer on site & I duly made a note to revisit with my girlfriend in tow to sample some of their ales & food which we did last week Both of us loved the look of the place & enjoyed trying some of their many beers including their own brews  the black IPA was very good The food whilst not fine dining was more than adequate pub fare - both of us opted for one of their salads with a portion of fries on the side & there were no complaints The staff were also very helpful & attentive We would definitely return especially for the beer 
positive,Called in here for the first time tonight Staff were friendly without being over the top Meat was fresh and tender plenty of veg all fresh and hot Only one gravy other pan empty but that was the only negative Always used the Toby before but the last few visits have been really poor and this is a much better alternative We will be back 
positive, Booked early evening  glad we did as there was not a spare seat in the house Food was good although a little on the pricey side for the main course dishes 
positive, As a veggie it is always a joy to have to decide what to eat rather than choose from a limited selection The menu was not too extensive a good thing but pleasantly varied in terms of ingredients and spicing  My colleagues are not vegetarians and were not well versed in Indian cuisine but the waiter was friendly helpful and attentive to the right degree We started with the ubiquitous papadum but were impressed by our main meals The cooking was very good and the spicing was excellently balanced Although the restaurant is not licensed it is fine to bring your own alcohol with you We were content with our very tasty and soothing mango lassi I shall go back if I am in the area again and it is something of a culinary oasis of real cooking in an area that has several mass-produced offerings 
positive, Really impressed with the whole experience especially the service which right from the moment we entered the restaurant was top class  The restaurant is airy and bright and well laid out so you are not sitting on top of other guests  Prices are quite high but still felt at the end of it that we had got good value for money which to me is a sign of good well run operation Could have tried the well priced lunchtime set menu but too tempted by the a la carte choices  One to remember and will go back 
positive, Lovely interior quite quirky Good selection of beers fairly standard pub menu but well cooked food 
positive, A good atmosphere in this pub friendly bar staff you can have banter with Served promptly and with decent ales Convenient location and plenty of space in the pub Would definitely visit again 
positive, Had read very good reports so visited for 1st time Would happily return Service is very efficient and friendly Chicken tandoori starter was excellent- really moist and tasty Chef special dansak was slightly disappointing  plenty of sauce but a little lacking in content but overall thoroughly enjoyable meal Vegetable bhaji was really good  
positive,Given its seaside location you d imagine a restaurant like this would play it safe with its menu and stick to traditional basics They don t here at all and what is served is a broad range of dishes at a decent price We went for tapas and what we were served was very good Two plates each for lunch was more than enough so don t over order unless you re a big eater I would recommend the fried parsnips with a honey and dijon mustard sauce Out of this world Great to eat and drink in a place like this with such a lovely view stretching over the Solent to the Isle of Wight 
positive, Living fairly nearby I ve become something of a  regular at this restaurant I can t say the food or service is the greatest but there s  something about the place that just appeals I can t take any of the other reviewers to task - they are pretty much correct in their observations- but for some reason I just can t put my finger on I ve throughly enjoyed every visit Maybe it s because this type of  Italian is fast disappearing only to be replaced by a kind of  fashionable version where the service is good but robotic and the food better than here but  soulless  Sometimes it s best just to go for the funkiness and forget the flash Incidentally I was taken there by regular and see the same folks all the time so it s definitely working for somebody 
positive, Went for Saturday lunch on a busy summers day First impressions were of a slightly daunting  boozer but inside the staff were all excellent and efficient  We were warned that it would be up to thirty minutes for lunch understandable and acceptable but it arrived much sooner to everyone s delight The manager was buzzing about checking on the customers and making sure that tables were cleared There seemed to be plenty of staff behind the bar clearing serving tables etc  Overall pleased with the decision to stop here for lunch and would go back again 
positive, WE live locally so this is one of our regular restaurants Its typical caf€÷ rouge fare but recently they seemed yo have upped their game a bit Friendly and efficient service their set menus are good value Perhaps not for a mega-treat for a birthday but very good everyday food Obviously will go again  and again 
positive, Great location on the river  great food  chunky chips nice too preferred the older decor with the leather sofas the new grey furniture and refurb has resulted in a starker atmosphere 
positive, An enjoyable meal well cooked nicely presented decent wine list Quite a small dining room - may be best to book 
positive, never been before yet only 10 mins away from us interia was warm and cosy staff polite and helpful food was very good and hot the breaded mushrooms for a starter were to die for on our list for return visit 
positive, This was our first time eating at the Cove restaurant and we were very pleased with the food drink and service The location and ambiance are superb looking out over the Marine Lake on a fine summer evening     it doesn t get much better than this We tried the Beer battered fish with hand cut chips and the Beetroot and goats cheese tart followed by a Honey panna cotta with pickled plums all on the early evening dinner menu 6-7pm Tues-Fri  We will be back to try the main dinner menu in the very near future 
positive, I have made numerous visits to the frog and rhubarb The food has generally been of a high standard and the tapas is great Bring back the meat loaf on the menu for the winter May visit again for our xmas meal with friends 
positive, If you have run your dog s along the beach at Kingsland Road or Cudmore Grove this is a welcome welcoming friendly place at which to recover and relax either indoors or at a picnic table outside From a full breakfast or fish and chips to a simple bacon or sausage bap with much more on offer including puddings they do it very well and always with a smile The nearby car park is free for an hour or 20p for two hours This first-rate always-bustling place is open for 364 days a year 
positive, This restaurant is a real gem Very tasty vegetarian food All served cash only from a counter downstairs for people wanting to eat in Order pay and take to a seat When available You get a glass for the fresh water on each table BYO if you need to Each day a new menu No reservations This restaurant manages its logistics magnificently well It is small but service is quick and through-put as well Take-away available upstairs Highly recommended also when not a vegetarian or vegan I am neither   And don t forget the tasty deserts  
positive, Has more than its fair share of atmosphere and is pleasantly located next to the city wall and handy for the Barbican where I caught Alex Higgins playing Jimmy White a few years back in an exhibition game - just thought I d share that with you  I ve fond memories of this place going back a fair few years and it has remained a favourite of mine through various renovations and changes in character 
positive, I love this place Not sure how long I have been eating here on and off Could it be 25 years Anyway thoroughly enjoyed an impromptu Valentines lunch on the 14th and the food service and atmosphere were as good as ever I know it s cheesy but if you throw a little bit of money at a decent bottle of red the big glasses come out Satisfyingly deflating the egos of all the Montepulciano slurping alpha males in sight The Ripasso is excellent  However the faint whiff of drains at the entrance really really needs sorting out and a charge for a tiramisu that I didn t have and didn t notice till I threw the bill away the next day was mildly irritating 
positive, This is a cheap and cheerful pub restaurant The staff were great showing us to a table straight away Clean and well decorated The food although standard pub food was well cooked and presented and tasty 
positive,Have been several times with the Curry Club from the pub five couples all served exellent authentic food you can take your own drink which is a bonus expecially when you use a groupon discount 
positive, Last went to red lion 12 months ago and when my daughter told me she had booked for 7 of us for a family birthday on 16th march i was a bit worried our last visit was not very good after reading latest reviews i was even more worried However everything was very good very pleasant waitress very good service and all food ordered was available and quite acceptable Its only fair that after giving a poor review on our last visit that we give credit this time for a good experience 
positive, Excellent food would highly recommend it Can not be beaten for quality value and price Will be going again 
positive, Wooden Village Hall with that friendly old fashioned charm Good service and food excellent Well worth a visit Situated on Arksey High Street Just off Station Road Arksey 
positive, Always a great experience when eating at The White Horse Good sized portions and reasonably priced too Having dined here numerous times both the food and service have always been consistently high 
positive, The food was excellent and the service was exceptional We had a party of 12 and the standards were very impressive Would certainly go back again Premium pricing but well worth it Excellent environment and was packed so a very popular venue - guess you need to book well in advance but try it 
positive, Our daughters booked us a table for our anniversary and it really didn t disappoint The restaurant is basic clean and comfortable-because of being in an arcade and with outside seating you can almost believe you re in the Med Overall  the service was friendly attentive and quick The food was mostly very good our only gripe was the olive oil for dipping which had next to no taste-small price to pay for what was overall a very tasty and enjoyable meal  especially enjoyed the whitebait and then the ox cheeks  A relatively small drinks list but enough to keep us happy Price ok- 60 for 7 tapas bottle of wine and four drinks 
positive, Ate here once during tis year s Three Choirs Festival Food perfectly adequate at a reasonable price but service very slow and although polite not very welcoming 
positive, Food is good here specially chilly paneer but there is lack of seating specially if you come with your extended family Good ambiance too 
positive,Saw the Tea rooms on the pier and decided to go in but had a really big surprise It was like entering the Savoy Tea room We decided to use the bar and the level of service was excellent The price of things we Middle to High 2 half s of larger and a coffee came to 7 10 but not bad If you are meeting someone special or having a business meeting this is the place 
positive, A pleasant surprise A simple setting which must have taken effort The good is well prepared and a good size portions Not quite fine dining but all the better for it Did miss on a egg not having a soft centre for a fish cake but otherwise a meal for three went without a hitch A really nice piece of cod for me and another main course of duck was excellent 
positive, lovely old fashioned pub with several real ales and full of character well worth a visit together with another pub close by called loggerheads although didn t get there this time 
positive, Really good value for money Good menu selection with two meals for 8 45 Nice surroundings and friendly staff Highly recommended 
positive,We went for the Oyster bar as part of a weekend away and werent disappointed The place is buzzing and vibrant and we were welcomed and shown to our seats at the bar Wine selection was good and not at stupid prices Great selection of Oysters backed up with knowledge from our server We had 2 dozen oysters and polished that off with some great wine Would return here 
positive, Food here is excellent and the location if your lucky enough to get to sit outside and on sunny evening is amazing with great views over the Solent to the Isle of Wight Closest reastaraunt I know to feelling your eating out abroad There are few restaraunts we would travel so far to eat out and this is our top one The service started well but we were ingored between the main meal and getting to order the desert Also found a number of items on our bill for someone else s table so beware  Arrive after 6 00pm and there s free parking outside 
positive, Friday lunch visit Confit duck rabbit for mains well cooked and seasoned Baked Alaska flamed in Grand Marnier to finish Theatrical  Service pleasant even if the waitress didn t seem to really know who RB is  Would definitely return as excellent value for money 
positive, Even though they were busy we were quickly shown to a pleasant table in the front bar and made to feel welcome The menu choice to intentionally limited but as a result our order came quickly and we were very pleased with our choice of dishes Their wine list is good and varied with a fair range of prices Very enjoyable 
positive, 4 of us went on Friday evening for a meal Although the restaurant was full we were shown to our table straight away and our coats taken The waiter was extremely attentive but always from a distance never in your face He was more than happy to answer any questions we had re the menu The squid starter is outstanding as is the suckling pig main My wife had a salad and the sirloin with tomatoes which although good the Sirloin weren t the outstanding steak she was expecting Both other guests were very happy with their meals The desserts were very nice too All in all a very worthwhile second visit which will definitely turn into a 3rd visit 
positive, Good Pub Food and a great selection of Beers and Cider  Nice people and great value for money  Will go again 
positive, Although a little pricey we managed to get seated without a reservation Best steak I ve had for months Staff very friendly too 
positive, This pub used to be dire       the sort of place that has trouble written all over it A few years ago that all changed with new owners and a full revamp of the pub  Today I m proud to call the Northbrook my local From the bar to the restaurant all of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful  Foodwise they have a good selection of bar food and food in the main restaurant The Sunday roasts are a great shout as is the burgers Deserts are not the best unfortunately 
positive, We were recommended this restaurant and we re not disappointed  The staff were lovely The food was outstanding I had possibly the best pork belly I ve had in a long time Cured by the chef - crackling crisp and the underneath crisp too and not as fatty as usual Served with a hogs pudding scotch egg and outstanding cider jus  My partner had the bream - very generous portion 2 large fillets in a lovely lemon sauce with wonderful creamy mash  Pudding - well it was just as good You can surprise yourselves  Wine list was varied and not expensive  We booked again whilst there  Definitely recommend It s not the cheapest in town but then you get what you pay for 
positive,Great Fish and Chips and great value  They do a well priced kids meal and the freshly fried chicken nuggets are better than McDonalds 
positive, The Frozen Mop is on of those places you take the family or granny out for a meal in the countryside  It s nicely decorated with a lovely feel to the place  it has a main restaurant and also little snugs to sit and eat if you wish  I like the menu it isn t pretentious and has all the classic meals with the occasional twist  if you are looking for reasonable value quality food and good service in a lovely environment  then i would recommend it 
positive,Good lunch reasonably priced as were the drinks Good choice at breakfast but some of the food was cold Didn t book the included breakfast for the stay at the Premier Inn so paid at the bar I think it wouldn t have been noticed if I hadn t paid 
positive, Never been to Sushi restaurant before so a little apprehensive This soon disappeared when I was welcomed with warm smile from the waitress My fellow diner was a regular so he took the lead with ordering Lovely tempura soft shell crab and prawns to start If I was being very critical it was a little greasy The next few courses were great and the tuna was amazing  tasted very fresh  The restaurant was full of regulars and the menu was great for a beginner like me  enough grilled and tempura for those less adventurous Don t be out off by thinking it s all raw  it s not  Parking ok in regency car park  looks like they have made much safer with extra security and ticket only entry The on road parking is not coin so be prepared by registering for phone activation To be honest the car park is better as cheaper for up to two hours   
positive, Food not great but really good atmosphere All round a really nice and cosy pub would go again for drinks especially in the summer time its great 
positive, Went into London for the day booked a table online the night before There were limited table times due to the last minute decision to book I now know why as it was busy all night  The food was great and defiantly value for money we had a sharing meat board with biggest gherkins I have seen  I followed with a pot of mussels and the waitress sold us dessert that I did not have room for but loved  If I was being critical I would say they needed a couple more team on as they have quite big sections so some people got food and drink at the same time All the team and mangers very friendly the open kitchen is a real plus  Will be back 
positive, We visited the Chung Ying Restaurant for a family lunch on Tuesday 29th October and had a fabulous meal Delicious food lovely clean restaurant and excellent service We have visited this restaurant many times before and look forward to returning soon 
positive,the restaurant was very busy at around 5 30 pm I had steak and ale pie I found this was very good and I did not wait very long for it to arrived
positive,After walking around the castle we decided to have dinner and had a wonderful meal in the Rising Sun the staff were excellent and the food was great would go back again when in the area 
positive, We tend to meet family here for our Christmas get together and have been doing so for about 3 years now This means we normally end up going with the set Christmas menu rather than the day to day menu  The staff are generally polite and prompt and service is usually on the money so no complaints there One area where they really seem to push the boat out is they ll often allow us to cherry pick food for our nephew according to what he wants which keeps him happy and is very welcome so does wonders for keeping order at the dining table -  Food we ve had to date has been very good year on year and it s a pleasant environment that reflects the building you re in Good for parties family groups or couples so really all bases are covered 
positive, We had a terrific family birthday celebration at the Good Earth Very nice combination of excellent ingredients expertly cooked and beautifully presented by people who clearly care about what they do Service was also spot on with right blend of attentiveness and calm Menu was excellent for a broad range of ages and tastes Happily recommend if you have the budget as it is far from cheap 
positive,4 of us visited on Friday for a meal and catch up The service was very good and the staff worked well to make sure we were looked after  The restaurant was busy with a mixture of small and large groups of people but this didn t affect the quality of service we received  The food was excellent and I can highly recommend the Thai Fishcakes as a starter The Roti s are also fantastic as an accompaniment to your main dish  Pricing is reasonable for the food quality and we will return again I d recommend booking at a weekend as it does get busy 
positive, I was here for the launch of a magazine in the function room at the back and while I was in London I arranged to catch up with friends When I arrived the place was really buzzing with a great atmosphere - it was a Friday night and there was hardly a seat everybody having a rare old time eating drinking and I dare see merry making too My friends had got in a bottle of wine an also ordered their meals- I was running late due to a delayed flight The food was very high quality the wine list pretty good and very reasonable The staff coped admirably with such a crowd and I ended up getting pretty sloshed on their Cabernet Sauvignon All in all a great pub with peely wallpaper and mismatched furniture The outdoor smoking area at the back is nice 
positive, Good selection of beers and reasonably priced wine list Food was very good both the choice and the quality Great value for money 
positive,Good hot food served quickly and well presented Staff very helpful and friendly If you are on a budget well worth a visit
positive, We turned up but could tell from outside that they don t do the buffet on a Sunday Decided Frankie and Benny s would be better but after close to fifteen minutes without being asked what drinks we wanted we upped and left and returned to Pizza Hut All the staff and especially the girl who served us Jessica were very good and really friendly We had starters and main Both were very good but we could have had the free salad that came with the main as the starter Wish we d gone there first 
positive, If you like your meat this is the place for you You choose the cut of meat the size and how you want it cooked then leave the rest to them Just about managed a pudding between us One guy came in and ordered a 23 oz steak Now thats just plain madness  
positive,Amazing drinks bartender Eddy made our night memorable yes this bar gets busy and probably hundreds of people around such a long bar and 6 bartenders you ll have to wait a bit for your cocktails but hey victim of their success Try the Oriental daiquiri or Love & Rocket we had the Asian platter  the meat melts in your mouth 
positive, It has to be said that the pubs in the area are very diverse in their quality and approach to customers The Manifold seems to have it right Through not perfect we found the Inn to be friendly warm clean and the menu selection good and reasonably priced The food quality varied from excellent to average None of the meals were poor but the quality depended on the staff on duty The quantity served was generous and the meat tasty and well cooked Sweets are also generous and well made We will certainly come back but do not expect a gourmet experience We don t need one 
positive,It is as you might expect lots of UK tourists celebrating a special occasion of some kind with first class expensive service and good food in a room like you would find on an ocean liner The French sommelier s English was so unintelligible I did not understand what she said about the champagne so I bought the cheapest 
positive, Fab burgers and great fries  and amazing shakes too full to try a dessert  Hard to fault other than it took a long time to take our order  didn t really bother us but in a place that busy I imagine a fast turnover of customers is key 
positive, A mid week evening meal on a promotion which gave you plenty of Prosecco a sharing platter to start and the a choice of a pizza or pasta each  The starter was badged as choosing from their pasta bar station which turned out not to be the case The promotion is running across all of their restaurants and as this is a smaller venue we guess they don t have the floor space to accommodate As it was the selection was good had some unusual items that we probably wouldn t have chosen but enjoyed nonetheless and with one exception it was all very tasty  Main courses - we had pasta and pizza between us were excellent  Desert and coffee followed not included in the promotional offer and a bottle of sparkling water was had too  With a 12 5 tip slightly unexpected automatic addition to the bill as it was only dinner for 2 and not a larger group we got change from 60 Personally I don t tend to include drinks in my tip calculation - delivering a bottle to the table doesn t warrant 12 5 to its cost  Overall we d definitely go back - staff were pleasant food was good and there were enough other mid week diners to give the restaurant an atmosphere 
positive, Reserved a table the day before Arrived in bad weather and stopped at door to drop off mother Staff passing immediately offered to assist Shown straight to table Two lunches with three meats and one senior lunch went down well Generous portions of hot food Sweets were enjoyed after a gap to allow for settlement All staff were friendly efficient and created a good atmosphere We will return 
positive,Located right on the waterside of thevBrayford pool one of the nicest spots in Lincoln Typical wetherspoons you always know you re going to get good food at a very reasonable price 
positive, Nice meal and good service Quite close to the hotel Italian style restaurant Good value for the money 
positive, Met up with friends on Sunday and had a great meal good choice on the carvry and serve hot very friendly staff and a good atmosphere a good job we had a table booked as the place was packed 
positive, 1940s style cafe selling proper traditional English cafe style food and tea served in old teapots with tea leaves and a strainer lots of nostalgic stuff on the walls and shelves staff are very welcoming and friendly prices are very reasonable Outside seating is very limited but my preference is inside anyway It s always been quite busy when I ve been but always managed to get a seat 
positive, We ve stopped off a number of times over the years and watched the many style changes the restaurant has gone through however the one thing that hasn t changed is the food Freshly cooked and hot Fish chips and a decent portion of mushy peas This visit was Friday evening 11 12 2015 So I was quite surprised at the negative comments on this site just goes to show there are some miserable people out there 
positive, Visited with friend Good choice of food which was delicious and served well Pleasant surroundings 
positive,I found the Caf€÷ Rouge to offer a good value breakfast that was improved further by the quality of food and the presentation 
positive,Nice hotel in the middle of pangbourne rooms have been refurbed but still have single glazing etc As in the town centre a bit of road noise but this quietens down at night Food excellent staff friendly only downside is parking for only about 6 or 7 cars but it is next to a public car instead 
positive, I was in a group of four out for an evening meal Each of us had a different selection without any complaint at all I was originally going to give three stars but on reflection the time spent just flew by which to me indicates that the surroundings were relaxing so on the basis of good honest food and relaxing surroundings I ve decided that it warrants four stars 
positive, very good food and the staff are very attentive but tables are a bit tight and you cannot start a conversation with tables to close I will go back and try a table at the corner 
positive, I visit here fairly regularly and is one of the nicest bars in Lytham Drinks are always well made service is generally good and good food They often have offers on the food which is good too  You generally get a good crowd in which is a change from a lot of places on the Fylde Coast but is prone to the odd 50p millionaire but there harmless It does get very busy friday saturday night and on sunny days tables on the terrace are at a premium Overall one of my favourite places on the area for a drink or lunch Classy feel reasonable prices and a good clientele 
positive,Wagamamas is great making oriental food accessible The quality is good the service is usually quick and its reasonably priced You really can t go wrong 
positive, Went on a Thursday evening the place was lively Mains were delicious as was the dessert Well priced plenty of options on the menu and the staff were very friendly Overall a very nice evening out recommended 
positive, This restaurant although small is a gem of a place  The quality and quantity of the food was excellent The portions sizes were very generous and excellent value for money The prawn puri was one of the best we have ever had not only in taste but in the quantity of prawns used and also the beautiful spices  The owner chef welcomed us to the restaurant and also came round the tables asking how the meals were We found all of the staff to be polite and friendly  Would highly recommend for an excellent meal at very competitve prices  My only negative comment is the menus were looking a little tatty and could do with being replaced Otherwise a good night was certainly had 
positive, Looking for somewhere to eat on a Saturday evening I went to Sergio s Italianissimo with my better half It was early so not to busy Got busier whilst we where there Starter main course and wine Great value 
positive, This is the latest of a number of cafe s that have opened in Wantage so to hold it s own it will have to be good I am sorry the previous reviewer dint have such a good experience for up to now I can only say good things about my visits the welcome is as geneorus as the portions and and the service prompt If there is a problem it is the location just out of the town centre but the short walk is well worth the effort yesterday i introduced two friends and I am sure they wil return Herb N 
positive, If you are visiting Durham Cathedral this is an excellent place to stop for refreshment This small cafe offers a very tasty range of sandwiches soup and cakes in a light and relaxed environment - a much more intimate space than the larger restaurant in the cathedral itself A range of seating makes the place different - ordinary chairs and tables but nice comfy settees too 
positive, Four of us had lunch here on Sunday and I was very much looking forward to it having checked the pub s website and read a couple of gastropub top 100s However chef of the 165 7 course tasting menu of your favourite foods with premium wine flight plus a glass of champagne obviously takes a well deserved day off on Sundays when the menu is reduced to a safe choice of three starters four mains and three puddings  We arrived at 2pm expecting it to be packed and it was a lovely surprise to find a nice quiet village pub that wasn t rammed to the rafters although obviously not such a great situation for the owners who I m sure would welcome the extra business  My ham hock starter with pickled veg and gooseberries was lovely a generous slab of meaty ham that went superbly with the fruit and veg - 10 10 and all very promising The spicy sweet potato soup was good but not that spicy which was a bit disappointing  Mains were a bit hit and miss The fish was as is so often the case overcooked and the rib of beef came with overdone Yorkshires and underdone roasties but the meat itself was excellent and certainly tips the score into very good rather than average  Service was polite but a bit stiff - it wasn t informal and relaxed as it should be in a pub or as it should be in a place like this that sets very obviously high standards for its food and it all got a bit comical when first the Coravin machine wasn t available despite a huge sign advertising it then they had sold out of their most popular wine and then the chef of the day couldn t find any fresh mint as they didn t know where 165 7 course tasting menu chef keeps it We were having a lovely time though with great friends and so none of this mattered in different circumstances though I might have been less equanimious  My pudding was fine but I didn t enjoy the coffee and the cheese plate wasn t great although as it was shared by the other three it was all scoffed  So there were plenty of things that weren t right but the excellent starter great meat and the lovely setting more than made up for it I d even come back on a Sunday as my expectations would be appropriately lowered but what I m really looking forward to is a trek out mid week when the good chef is in - the 165 a head menu might have to wait though 
positive, Good atmosphere cheerful happy Resteraunt Food good for vegetarien great starter Nan was hung on metal hook at least 4 foot in diameter Service great even if a Man Utd fan No hurry main courses good both well filled by end of meal If you want a quite romantic meal not the place to go if you want to see life buzzing around you and a happy bunch of people go here 
positive,Friendly pub in remote location Morwenstow is miles and miles from Bude with restaurant including a large well-lit conservatory dining room and outside seating in good weather Serves food pretty much all day during the summer season reduced hours in winter  making it an especially nice stop-off for walkers on the coast path Good pub food large portions Very friendly staff as others have noted 
positive, Regrettably we had occasion to send cold food back but I have to say the consequential customer service was absolutely fantastic They were determind to ensure that we did not leave hungry or unhappy and we didn t  They completely turned a sour experience around which means that we have the confidence to recommend it and indeed return ourselves 
positive, Pre De La Warr gig meal So handy lovely meal prompt service Quite delicate flavours Had a hot chicken dish which was excellent mixed dumpling starters also excellent My wife had a hot sweet chicken dish that was just a bit sweet for our palates The garlic nan was lihht and delicious If we are back in Bexhill we would happily return 
positive, With our planned cafe stop closed for their annual holiday we decided to try Walk Mill a place I had not been to before In a quite location making it safe to leave your bikes unattended but also having space to put your bike inside if the weather was inclement All the cakes were homemade and reasonable priced however there did not appear to be any gluten free option We could not fault the coffee and cakes we had see attached photo and will be returning again in the near future There is also a large wood burner which will be a very inviting on our winter rides 
positive, Don t be put off by the entrance to this pub restaurant We were made to feel more than welcome by Sean Good food friendly service and pleasant atmosphere We will go back soon 
positive, We went the other night to celebrate a friends birthday The staff attended to our table of 15 with speed and efficiency and the flavours of the meats was fantastic Thanks to all the management team who ensured our visit was special Cant wait to visit again soon 
positive, Went there for breakfast on a Saturday morning and was surprised how quiet it was There was plenty of staff the service was prompt and efficient and the food was very good The Welsh rarebit and poached egg can be recommended Cost for 4 people was 38 
positive, We visited the upstairs restaurant and where amazed by the good value For 27 we both had 3 courses and a bottle of wine The food was proper pub grub and we where impressed by the gammon Would definitely recommend oddfellows to anyone 
positive,Located on The Kingsway The main road next to the beach you have a great sea view while you eat The Captains Table provides most meals that you could want My wife and I went for the fish and chips It was very good value at 6-50 I think the reason we both left some chips was because there were too many on our plates I thought the service was excellent the waitresses were all smiles as they did their jobs 
positive, Visited The Plough on spec It has a comfortable welcoming atmosphere and offers a more extensive menu than most pubs The menu is varied and whilst offering the basics it also has that something different We were a group of four who all chose something different and all the meals were excellent albeit a little more expensive than standard pub prices Despite not being particularly busy when we arrived the initial service re drinks and taking of order was slow Otherwise a very good experience 
positive,I popped in to this new restaurant quickly for the first time to collect a take away pizza and some pasta  Firstly I was very impressed by the atmosphere Italian music playing in the background and full tables filled with good food and plenty of chat  There are about 10 tables in this restaurant and all but 1 was taken amazing for a Sunday evening in New Romney  Secondly the food The pasta was cooked perfectly and had the perfect blend of tomatoes olives onion and chilli  The pizza was a wonderful surprise and a million miles from the usual poor efforts served by local kebab shops in the area The pizza was not over cooked and had a generous topping of rocket  All things considered a great addition to the area and an example to follow for neighbouring restaurants 
positive, I decided to book at the Fisheries for a family lunch as we have previously had both good food and good service here I m glad I did the staff were again friendly and welcoming the food was very good and overall it was exactly what I wanted - an enjoyable lunch with nice surroundings I will no doubt be booking another return visit 
positive, Came in here after visiting Little Johns grave very apt after a long walk really needed a cool drink normaly im a real ale drinker  but being hoy and bothered i had a pint of lager Lot of people in here and people eating but we didnt stop we had to go somewhere else Nice friendly pub 
positive, Went in here after gig at Barclaycard arena Nice bar with a good menu Worth a visit when close to the venue 
positive, A couple of friends took me out here for an impromptu birthday dinner and we were well looked after The sharing starters were more than ample the soft shell crab was delicious and the mains were really tasty I had a love duck dish and washed it down with Beer Lao a really rather interesting rice beer from Laos Would definitely recommend for good central Thai food 
positive,Staff were friendly and helpful food arrived efficiently and was accurate to what we ordered The food was enjoyable and a fair size portion standard harvester quality and I would recommend if in the area 
positive, After spending the morning on the beach we went on the hunt for some lunch After checking out the ludicrous prices at Winstons Fish Bar next door we opted to give Raddys a go Well best decision we made all day They had disable access for our 4 year old son who is in a wheelchair and the tables were low enough for him to eat in his chair The staff where friendly and happy to help if required The food was generously portioned to say the least well cooked and tasted great The coffee was pretty good also Overall we had an enjoyable meal which was good value for money The decor was a little on the tired side if you want to get picky particularly the toilets could do with a revamp but everywhere was clean considering the building gets worked hard as it is a cafe restaurant during the day evening and then a pud club at night We ll be eating here again upon our next visit to Weston for sure 
positive, We held a leaving do for one of our senior execs here last week Excellent location with a bright open space at the end of the restaurant bar Plentiful supply of beer and wine with staff on hand to keep flowing Pizza etc to fill the food gap also All in all an excellent evening in an ideal venue Will use again 
positive, Everything you would expect of a straightforward no pun intended fish and chip shop Friendly staff and great value We always make a beeline for this shop when we re nearby 
positive, Went to Nonno s for the first time last weekend with my wife just for a meal out We booked late and could only get a table at 6 45 which shows how busy and popular this restaurant is but this was fine for us  We were nicely greeted on arrival the order for drinks was taken quickly and when we ordered the food it came quickly was well presented looked and tasted excellent There was a choice of 3 Specials for main course - I chose the Medallions of Beef in a Masala wine sauce with Asparagus It was excellent My wife chose Seafood Rissotto which was tasty and had a good selection of seafood in it  Now Nonno s is not cheap but you get what you pay for It is well staffed and serves quality food I would recommend it for an Occasion meal Of course if you can afford to go on a whim then do so 
positive, Popped into this one in the Hilton Hotel near Tower Bridge Great restaurant and bulletproof in terms of what you can I usually go for the squid for starters and then see what the specials are for main course Great value and food 
positive, Called in for a coffee and was excited by the innovative menu on offer I had avocado cheesecake which was very good and my wife had a borek platter which was good - and huge Certainly worth a visit if you want something to eat that is not typical coffee shop 
positive, We booked late and they accommodated 16 of us the service was excellent the food order was made in good time and it all arrived together and considering the restaurant was fully booked that was good The food was all very good tasty and well prepared definitely worth a visit 
positive, Came here for the first time last weekend I love this type of food staff was polite food was a little pricey for what it is but really enjoyed it Thanks 
positive, My family and I recently visited this restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed our experience We were immediately greeted upon arrival by Raj who was fantastically enthusiastic He made sure we felt comfortable and at ease throughout the evening The food was delicious with lots of variety from diverse backgrounds It was very easy to find your way around There was a family atmosphere which emphasised the fact that the restaurant is enjoyable for all ages We would definitely go again if possible  Howard Family 
positive, We haven t been here for a few months after some bad experiences with waiting time Today was totally different  The pub was relatively empty but the staff were very attentive We ordered our food and it came very quickly I had the chicken pie and it was delicious My family member had the ham egg and chips She said it was the best ham she had had in ages  The prices are reasonable Our only sight negative was the options on the menu A few of our old favourites didn t seem to be on the menu There is still plenty of choice though 
positive, All sorts of drinks meals and interesting objects-d arte in one location Very unusual settling with out-door log burning kilns that have scented smoke and remind of the old charcoal burners hideaways  A lovely experience that sets out to entertain with good giggs on many evenings and comes into its own most of all in the summer  Highly recommended 
positive, Royton is not known for it s restaurants however this branch of a chain of restaurants has proved to be a gem We were given a warm and genuine welcome Our table by the window was great The menu was not too long with a good selection for anyone Our waiters were always available and helpful The food arrived quickly and was very good Drinks were very good with a good selection of wines The restaurant was very busy which demonstrates the success of this restaurant 
positive, Nice atmosphere decent food good place to eat with a group of friends or family Good friend staff heledto make it a nice evening 
positive, Great friendly service and atmosphere always busy and not long to wait good food and fun menu Burger and chips a speciality and a treat well cooked and served 
positive, My friends and family go to Chefs regularly the food is good the price is right but best is the service  If you want something cooking to your taste no problem as it should be 
positive,Beautiful setting with great views Wonderful menu if a little on the expensive side for some things First class service and friendly efficient staff Not the place for a light meal Burger and chips 12 
positive, I tried the Swan and Dog for the first time recently having previously eaten at the Old Mill and Chequers on the Green pubs It was a Sat night and the place was packed but the food arrived promptly and I was pleased to see that the portions were as seems to be a signiture of these pubs big  This is definitely a good place to go with friends if you want atmosphere decent food and big portions 
positive, Valve for money friend sly staff A must for that better burger excellent corporation pop and it s free have two glasses 
positive, My wife and I have visited several Chaophraya restaurants in different cities and have never been disappointed with the meal we ve had This time it was the lamb shank massamam yellow curry and it was fantastic Honestly a great alternative to a traditional Thai dish The service is always good and was again when we visited although it s a little more expensive - I do believe in paying more for good food and good service so am always happy to do so and would definitely go back to any Chaophraya restaurant 
positive, booked a table weeks ago and thinking it may be busy No need to really Nice atmosphere with a good crowd being catered for with the waiting staff attentive Ours was Sean who catered for our needs Food was good with bruschetta and dipping oil as an entree I had a Portobello mushroom starter followed by a Pizza and enjoyed a large Peroni Partner had Hake on a griddle which she really enjoyed  Recommend checking the drinks prices as they can really bump up the bill Enjoyed the night and will call again when in Exeter 
positive, Booked in this friendly restaurant again on our recent stay in Boscastle Have eaten here before and it s one of those places where you re pleased to say it never changes Quality of food and wine is consistently good here and that s matched by the friendly and attentive service from the staff and owners  Brilliant 
positive,The quality of the food is good but the main appeal is the ambience and the service It s a lovely relaxed atmosphere and a nice place to go even just for a drink 
positive,I had an absolutely fantastic time This was my second time visiting so we decided to take the kids Was family friendly they enjoyed the play area Overall the atmosphere was friendly and inviting The food was good however i felt the wine list was lacking The staff were superb especially the waiters and waitresses My waitress made my average Tuesday feel special and her enthusiasm was a refreshing change I will definitely be visiting again
positive, His is perched above Lyme Regis bay a heart thumping walk up winding steps but commanding a magnificent view out to sea  We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary and were looked after brilliantly by the staff The place was busy as it was the height of the tourist season and the room was warm in fact very warm at times but luckily we were placed near a door to the terrace My wife started with the local grab which was an generous portion of fresh and tasty meat served with fresh bread - magnificent I had the the fish fingers and chips for main but had food envy again for my wife s brill The restaurant very generously game us free chocolate s to finish our night We ll be back 
positive, Visited the coffee shop for some coffee Dorset apple cake and stunning views Wasn t dissapointed Lovely day so went outside the front not the hotel where there was seating for the views and also a sculpture of the Olympic rings 
positive, I ve been going to this Indian for 6 years It is the best in Sunbury - nice food attentive service and a nice beer selection  The food is priced competitively  
positive,Nice country open planed pub with great atmosphere Good selection of draft beers and well kept the food was excellent with plenty to choose from liked the option that my Son was able to have a smaller portion sizes which was priced accordingly 
positive, Good friendly service terrific food and wine choices Lively atmosphere without being too loud   Will be returning again and again 
positive, We fell upon this place whilst looking for somewhere to eat before attending a rugby match on Friday night  I have given the restaurant 4 stars but would have liked to have given it 4 5 if possible We did have a small issue with a side order but the lovely lady who works there I believe it s her family restaurant could not do enough to resolve the issue giving us another free side order  My wife loved her saut€÷ed mushroom meal and I had a gorgeous and large porcini pizza  If ever we are in the area again we will definitely go back  
positive, Back in the area and Mac remembered me straight away made to feel welcome with good service and a smile Tarka dall is excellent 
positive, We had dinner on Valentine s night Things did not start well Having given our name the Maitre D took us to the wrong table and then left us standing in the middle of the dining room like spare parts at a wedding while he went off to find the right table Having seated us he brought the wrong menu so then went off again to find the correct one We were surprised at the lack of professionalism  After that however things greatly improved The sommelier and the waiters were excellent The menu was varied and beautifully presented It tasted good too We would have given 5 stars had it not been a poor start When we are next in London we may pay another visit 
positive, Sunday lunch with my 80 year old father and his partner Three course table d hote menu  12 for 1 courses  18 for 2 and 21 for 3 We had all 3  10 discretionary service charge Perfectly OK for us  Lovely crab salad to start for me with Cod for main and cheese board three cheeses to finish Complimentary and tasty bread came first Other guests had a barley and lamb soup followed by chicken breast and lovely puddings  Very good value  We were first to arrive at about 12 30 Was a bit worried when empty but quickly filled up Leisurely meal over ca 2 hours was just what we wanted Service not speedy but perfectly acceptable  There are ca 5 or 6 steep steps to get access to restaurant important when you are dining with 80 year olds  but there is a wheelchair lift by the side albeit we didn t see it used  We were able to park immediately outside - might have been fortunate  Overall - worked for us Would go back if in area again 
positive, Arrived and were seated quickly and given menus and offered a drink immediately Service service service this place has got the right attitude The food was well presented cooked to perfection and all served with a smile We will return very soon Justin & family 
positive, Stopped on the way into Fareham shopping centre It s a good choice to have a late full breakfast and is was really nice & good cup of mocha coffee to Staff are all very happy and helpful and willing to supply a good service and it shows Coffee is lovely Italian type coffee and it was a really enjoyable eating experience 
positive, We had a really enjoyable evening at the restaurant This is part of the excellent Royal William Yard development and is a great location  The staff are efficient and friendly trying to make the visit a real pleasure Food is freshly cooked and comes promptly to your table A tasty option for all occasions  
positive, Bill s arrived in Horsham with a buzz of excitement that I have not encountered over a restaurant in the Town before its reputation throughout Sussex is well known and its huge success in Brighton and Lewes is expected to be mirrored in Horsham but has the one time independent now turned into just another chain I went along to find out  Immediately I was struck by the venue the former town hall of Horsham Owner Bill Collinson has chosen his location and building as carefully as ever and it pays off with its unique and beautiful architecture contrasting the homely rustic interior The familiar produce and wares are still present although not in the abundance to be found in the other  stores   This is definitely more of a restaurant with a cosy ambience and a relaxed soundtrack the caf€÷ feel of the Bills Brighton is gone and replaced with a trendy London feel We were escorted upstairs to our table and served well by attentive staff who although marginally over keen were polite and capable  To start I ordered the bruschetta of British marzanino tomatoes and basil The bruschetta was slightly over toasted however this didn t detract from the dish being tasty and filling with a nice dashing of balsamic vinegar and some goat s cheese to add a different texture to quite a crunchy dish  For the main I had the pan fried salmon with beetroot tortellini with a pea mint and chickory salad The salmon was slightly dry on top but perfectly cooked in the middle the salad beneath was a nice contrast and the tartare was refreshing Unfortunately my beetroot tortellini was delicious but far too few two pieces of medium sized tortellini made me thanks the stars I had eaten a starter  To finish I had the warm chocolate brownie which although adequate was nothing more To drink I had the La garenne syrah with the starter and the Le duc viognier with the main both were well priced and complimented the dishes particularly the second  Despite enjoying the evening I admit to being a little confused by Bills Horsham it is clearly a restaurant but seems to struggle with the evening weekend dining experience and appears to be much more suited to the daytime meals and coffee brigade The laid back Lewes Brighton vibe is replaced by a slightly awkward muddle of formal evening and informal daytime dining  The building although beautiful and fantastically finished was cold and led to one of the staff bringing my wife a blanket which is fine outside a pub but in a restaurant where the bill for two easily reaches 50 I will leave that up to you I think it is a small gripe for such a great restaurant and it didn t tarnish our visit  All in all our evening was very good and certainly a nice change of speed from the Italian chain-fest that is East Street and we will definitely be returning The variation of the menu the location and the undeniable beauty of the interior and exterior makes this an excellent edition to Horsham and despite the slight identity crisis is still clearly a must visit for the area  http  esbreviews blogspot co uk 
positive, We visited the Crispin yesterday evening for dinner and beer Excellent pub very friendly welcome Showed the menu table of our choice Curried goat and dumpling for 2 of the guests plus a sirloin steak for myself The sweets were excellent cheesecake cheeseboard ice cream and treacle tart Good beers from the Green Hop Ales of Mad Cat Brewery Overall excellent 
positive, Tried to get a table at TGI Fridays but was fully booked so was given this restaurant  as a recommendation  Not knowing what to expect since a true Roadhouse can be a rowdy place went with open mind  On arrival was greeted politely buy two burly doormen who asked if we had a reservation which I initially thought implied if u haven t your not getting in  which for 7pm on a Thursday was surprising   but we did have one and so was escorted down stairs  which means no wifi   We was shown to a booth  I d ask every time of a booth as the tables seem a tad small  Our waitress was very prompt and greeted us with a lovely warm smile  in truth Chanel was the highlight but Anna who it turns out was on her first day was an able back up  gave us the cocktail menu and took our drinks order and allowed us to peruse the menu at our leisure  The menu it has to be said is a tad basic but then it s is just a Roadhouse   But even I was able to find something to order so it can t be too bad   battered squid and ribs  The food was lovely though if I m very harsh I d say the plates  metal  and the glasses plastic  left me thinking really   If I did have a criticism I d say it was the size of the plastic glasses  was it  I m a non drinker and so I will have a soft drink but there glasses are just one size  SMALL or regular large is not available which is annoying and expensive   The RoadHouse has a late licence and fills up later on in the evening with alive band from 9pm and a dance floor  It s a place I would go to again even if Chanel wasn t working lol  
positive, No bigger than a coffee shop so you ll have to book but what a great little place Fine service and knowledgeable staff with quality wines and food to match  For an idea of the price we ordered 3 wine tasting sets 3 x 50ml with 5 cheeses and 5 wines and two coffees to finish which came to 65  Westbourne is a great place with plenty of places to go for drinks after so make a night of it 
positive, We haven t visited this restaurant since Diane was in charge Oh how the atmosphere has taken a nose dive The current incumbent Maitre d has an appalling attitude and table manner Friends of ours who visit regular have the same opinion Everything seems to be too much trouble for this guy and his sarcasm knows no bounds The young staff are superb and can t be faulted they raised their eye brows when we questioned his table manner they said other people had said how inappropriate his attitude was for Il rosso they apologised and said that that was just the way he was My wife and Sisterinlaw wanted steak and both asked for it to be well done but oh no not with this chef He thinks he knows better than us how we want our food It would seem you can have your steak any which way you want here as long as it s bleeding all over the plate Come on Il rosso lets get some standards back or even better get Diane back 
positive, Ive been travelling around West Midlands and stopped in Pendulum pub for couple drinks and food Surprisingly food was lovely very fresh well served Drinks was for reasonable price and really good have no complain Pub was worm and nice while outside was cold Stuff was really helpful and friendly    
positive, We had a meal in here recently whilst staying at the Crossover B&B good food and atmosphere fire was crackling and service was really good 
positive, Had a nice sit down meal and a few pints at the Fox Excel during Comic Con at Excel Despite being almost full at least 800 people  The food came out within 15 minutes and was very good The staff were polite despite other reviews i have read on here and were very helpful in helping me charge my phone and call a taxi  I will be coming back in October 
positive, Walking in it certainly has its own character which you wouldn t expect from how it looks on the outside The menu is dripping in BBQ glory I opted for the pork burger and was not disappointed Though pricey it tasted great it would ve been nice to have some fries thrown in for the cost though Enjoyed the rum-based cocktail forgetting the name but complemented the food nicely A few of us stayed later for the live music all very enjoyable and a nice evening out overall 
positive, I visited Brasserie blanc southbank for their preview of the autumn menu I was pleasently suprissed at the high level of service and the great quality of food I have been to the venu many times before when it was Chez Gerard and I felt that brasserie Blanc have really lived up to the expectations of a real brasserie in France As I said my experience was excellent and I will definately return many times 
positive, Went for a meal with my wife as had been getting good reviews  Food was tasty and well presented Only slight issue was that the service was a little slow Don t known if it was just a blip but that is the only thing they need to get on top of in my opinion but would go again 
positive,It was really nice experience in your restaurant I was in Brixton and was looking for somewhere to eat for a lunch time You guys really surprise me with your service and food 
positive, The staff are very friendly and the potions are large so visit when you are hungry The food is very good and served with a smile every time 
positive, I was great need of a good shot of decent coffee and asked for a strong cup WOW  superb strength but not bitter black coffee with carrot cake millionaires shortbread needs some work to get taste up a bit 
positive,It makes a great change in a city like Bath to have a very modern place to eat Right next to the station platforms and about to start brewing beer within the restaurant it s got a fair bit of novelty too The food was generally really good although the chicken was a little dry the drinks were good they brew plenty of options off this site already  The service was really good attentive nicely so and everything came at the right time Would happily recommend and will probably return 
positive, Liked the food although a bit more would be good speed of service was good  Took clients out and they seemed to enjoy it Very good overall 
positive, Great Value Italian Food My wife had the spaghetti bolognese which she just adores I had the chicken breast with creamy mushroom sauce - the chicken was a little over cooked and rubbery which was disappointing you need to keep a check on consistent food quality  I had the same dish last month when I was in London I ve been visiting the same restaurant for years and it was definitely much better My sons had pizzas which were excellent My daughter-in-law had the lamb shank which was delicious Excellent house white wine I will return but maybe not for the chicken breast 
positive, Star and Garter is a great addition to the Falmouth food scene We went for evening dinner and the staff were friendly and the atmosphere is good The menu is always good however they had run out of two of our choices and we had to change our order Saying that what we did order was very nice The view from the restaurant is very nice but when we booked they can not reserve a table by the window which is a shame When we visited there was evening entertainment which was nice a lady playing the piano Although a bit loud if wanting a quite evening meal Overall good food good servise and a good experience 
positive, Great food we had the sharing platter for starter and the Thai green curry and the hair red curry Both brilliant Service also very good Only part that could be improved is the atmosphere - listening to one direction doesn t really create that Thai dining feeling 
positive, We visited Leo s on Saturday the 2nd of July and were pleasantly surprised first of all the older lady that welcomed us and took our orders sorry we didn t catch her name was lovely gave us advice on our food and didn t rush us to order All our food came in good time and was very tasty My pizza was one of the best I ve ever had I d also recommend they cheese and tomato garlic bread  I think they also do takeaways any chance of delivering to Sheffield  We will definitely be back  
positive,It was Christmas Eve and we had booked to see the panto at The Theatre Royal We arrive at Ask at midday and did not have a booking Nearly all the tables were reserved but the manager did his best to accommodate us 4 adults and 2 kids into a booth The food and service was very good This is a very good little restaurant with classic Italian food in a relax friendly environment
positive, Nice food nice staff Had four poached eggs on brown bread and Mike had full breakfast realy good will visit again in the near future  
positive, Nice quirky place very community-spirited eg jam on sale raising funds for local projects  and the best coffee in south Leeds as far as I know  
positive, Six of us took up the 35 four course deal incuding flowing prosecco The food was excellent and the ambience was very good The only down side was a surprise on the bill Having had a couple of welcome drinks and a couple of after dinner cocktails really bumped up the bill a lot - and I mean a lot So go for the food and drink deal and stick to it 
positive, Sometime service can be slow because they only have 1 person serving Good choice of Real Ales available 
positive, Visited on lunchtime with some work colleagues Food was excellent and 2 courses for 10 on lunch menu was fantastic value Will go again 
positive,No fuss just a simple cafe serving dumplings and light asian food Foods are freshly made and delicious Dumplings are their specialities The fried noodle with red ginger was delicious and tasty This cafe offers an intimate asiatic feel with friendly waiters 
positive, We have been before a number of times and decided to treat our friends for their wedding anniversary booked and attended 6 of us and were taken downstairs for our drinks cocktails Then to the table the staff were very polite the information about the steaks was attentive & very helpful Food as always delicious they also brought the celebrating pair a glass of fizzy each nice touch in a busy but relaxing and comfortable setting Not cheap but good value and well worth a visit or two  
positive, Initially greeted warmly by the barman who proceeded to take drinks orders which turned up quickly Starts to go down from here - took 25 minutes for someone to take our order Not good as in a rush The waitress seemed unsure as to what to do From here on things get better Starters took max ten minutes to arrive and were excellent Main course appeared shortly after and was perfect  Would have got 5 stars but for that initial delay in taking orders 
positive, Very cosy pub friendly staff and a more than decent Sunday dinner Even though the food area was packed the service was quick Good value at under 10 Can t comment on the standard menu as our whole party had the Sunday lunch  I have also been in just for a pint and would recommend A good local pub in a fantastic location 
positive, Due to the poor quality in the Ramada next door we embarked on the Boathouse and we were not disappointed It was a busy Friday night yet we managed to get a table and order some Hunters Chicken and Burger and chips the food was of a very decent standard 
positive, Not many restaurants in Sheffield would have a buzz about them on a Monday night but The Castle did Obviously the mix of great pub food and draught beers is a winner with the locals and those like me that travelled from Leeds  Service was great and the whole experience very good 
positive, I had dinner here with my partner and a friend after work The welcome was warm by the staff and we were presented with a well curated wine list After being presented with a very nice bottle of wine our starters arrived  The choice of food was focused but wide enough for variety with very well balanced flavours It was all quite delicious and certainly a nice mix of French and Italian culinary heritage presented in a way that is accessible  I would recommend for a small group of friendly foodies or an intimate dinner with that special someone 
positive, Our family of 6 called at this Hostelry at midday on August 9th on our way to Bristol Airport The Winford Arms has a goodly sized car park and many tables both inside and out for familys to partake of a drink and or food Despite being very busy we were all served with our meal in a relatively short space of time The food was piping hot and of good quality staff were conscientious and enquired whether everything was satisfactory and were happy to take our further orders for drinks at the table A definite must for food whenever you are in the area 
positive, Had a fantastic meal excellent quality and a good price We ordered off the specials menu Mixed grill and Sole had desserts and a bottle of wine and had change out of 60 Very good indeed 
positive, We had a 2 night stay Sunday Monday  The room was full of character very well decorated large comfortable and very clean  The food was excellent on both nights and breakfast simply amazing Only disappointment was that the open fires were not lit minor detail  Good bus service to Henley and some great places to visit nearby Thank you to all the great staff at the White Hart for a great break  We left the restaurant before 10 30 on both nights so cannot comment on the previous review about being thrown out at 11 00 
positive, Having visited this pub restaurant before I honestly wasn t expecting much as in the past it has been mediocre at best but this time it was a little different On arrival we we re given a warm welcome by who I assume was the duty Manager - A young man in smart dress We approached the bar and again were greeted with a friendly hello we ordered drinks and were reminded that we would need a table number to order food The food arrived in good time and was hot and well presented It was probably the best meal we ve had from an outlet of this type We ordered deserts after and they were very nice too I hope they keep up the good work I will be visiting again to find out 
positive, Must be the best place to eat in Warrington Located in a Manor House in Victoria Park The ambience is superb The menu is short but with excellent choices The lamb was beautifully prepared and really succulent The staff were attentative but not overbearing The live music was present but in the background Will definitely return 
positive, Went with a large group 35 of us for a Christmas meal Lovely food not rushed and great atmosphere I ve never had a bad meal here Very reasonable Great so far But when we wanted to sit and chat with our drinks the Karaoke was put on Bizarre range of songs for a Dec 2013 songbook Morcombe and Wise Bring me sunshine Wonderwall New York New York Hey Baby Someone said that they were a group of songs for drunks Not very Christmassy Also it was on REALLY LOUD to the point that we ended up leaving though we d have preferred to say longer and have a few more drinks 
positive, Lovely fish and chips quick polite service and very popular Would recommend and will visit again when we are in Seaton 
positive, I have been to Red Peppers twice now within the last month Both times have been varying in terms of service quality whilst the food itself has been excellent  Located within the Mailbox complex Red Peppers is a very inviting restaurant that seems to cater for varying cuisine styles I like how they blend popular stuff such as pasta and pizza into a menu with burritos and steaks Very versatile Both times visiting I have had the Chicken Burrito which is very yummy plentiful portion with a nice amount of garnish Their pizzeria breads are also yummy The ambiance is warm and relaxing the walls decorated with varying items This aspect of the restaurant really does not have faults  As for the service the first time was great Very attentive and pleasant staff The second time however bearing in mind it was on a relatively quiet Sunday afternoon wasn t so great The staff seemed rather lazy and a lack of attention really seemed to come through Having worked in the restaurant business before I know how sometimes it can be a bit tedious therefore I m always willing to be a bit more relaxed about service quality This however was pretty poor and reflects badly upon the restaurant Which is a shame considering the quality of cuisine on offer I feel this is one aspect that could be improved  Overall Red Peppers is certainly a restaurant I would recommend it just doesn t seem to tick all the boxes consistently at the present time 
positive, Nice clean and pleasent pub with a lovely view out on to the river just sit and enjoy the sunshine as people wave as they pass by A+++ 
positive, We had full run of the private function room which had a bar solely provided for our use The service was also dedicated to our every wish The whole evening was a pure delight 
positive, We have been going to this restaurant for a few years It has changed hands in that time but the quality of food stays good Larger choice of food recently you can always find something you will like 
positive, We re Blackpool locals and tend to avoid Blackpool restaurants as generally speaking they don t have a great reputation Trip Advisor has started to make us think again We visited AJ s on the basis of its reviews and rankings Certainly it s not much to look at from the street - indeed you could easily miss it altogether - but inside AJ s is spacious airy and modern without being cold We opted for the midweek specials menu of simple yet well priced options We began with an excellent homemade pate complemented by a delicious chutney The gammon dish that followed was well cooked with the very best chips I ve had in ages Hardly haute cuisine but perfect after a busy day at work The house wine was good and the wider menu looked interesting and varied if a little on the pricey side  Best of all though was the service from the owner and her daughter Friendly attentive amusing and extremely personable without ever feeling forced or overdone It turned a restaurant to which I would probably return into a restaurant I ll definitely try again And next time I ll be exploring some of the steaks which sounded delicious 
positive,I ve been looking for a really good Japanese restaurant since visiting Japan and have tried several offerings in London but have been left wanting However that has all changed now since discovering Eat Tokyo their food is the best I ve tasted since being in Japan and at a price that is palatable too I have already been back and will be a regular from now on 
positive, Good Indian in the city centre Nice to go with a bunch of people so you can order plentiful enormous naan breads - COVERED in garlic really yummy It s really lovely place to dine if not a little noisy but that s ok if you re with a bunch of people Very swish decor and nice lighting which makes it a bit of an event The food is lovely and nicely presented- there are some great vegetarian options on the menu too I feel that it was slightly expensive probably due to aforementioned decor location but not overly so for such a nice experience Also add the staff are polite and nice Defo want to go again and try something like a paneer curry 
positive, We enjoyed a family dinner at the Queen and Castle for the first time in several months We were upstairs it was quite busy and overall the experience was enjoyable Food was good - Seafood Platter Fish & Chips Sea Bass Burger all nicely presented Only moan was that that coffees and dessert went a little off track and arrived bit by bit 
positive, Opened in January 2016 presumably in the same premises occupied previously by Ciao Ciao  Amarone Ristorante is an excellent new Italian restaurant My wife and I were impressed by the warm welcome the extent of the menu the quality of the food and the coverage of her necessary gluten-free diet The highlight for both of us was the Ragu which accompanied pasta tagliatelle for me and gluten-free fusilli for her 
positive, 3 course good value set lunch at 14 95 today had plenty of choice with 5 options to choose from 2 with supplements This gives a very nice deliberation over the menu  Jug of tap water served without requesting - very nice touch  Small carafe 500cl of house wine tasty and mellow  Coffee at 2 50 not extortionate  Not been here for a few years but it still retains a class act in the culinary department in suburban Bristol Not far from Redland station but in the Residents Parking Zone during daytime hours so you may have to pay to park locally if not on foot  Well recommended 
positive, We went on a busy weekend late afternoon Good atmosphere as soon as we entered A very helpful staff member Zivile talked my elderly mother through the menu explaining each dish and then ensured through the evening that we were satisfied All the various food served was well presented and without exception excellent A great place to go for a family outing thoroughly recommended 
positive, We picked an odd time to go to The Castle 4 o clock on a Sunday and crossed our fingers everything was as good as it had been previously  It was  Lovely French Onion soup on a wet and miserable day in July followed by a T-Bone steak cooked exactly how I ordered it Lovely service even as it got busier and busier all of the meals were of a decent quality the Sunday Dinner platter looks amazing  Puddings looked good too and a lovely pint of Speckeled Hen to top it all off 
positive,Cam only talk about Sunday lunch -12 quid or big plate with 3 meats for for 14 quid Good feed with plenty of spuds yorkies and veg Not fine dining but a good grub at the right price portion which we all enjoyed   Large selection of ale and some nice quality largers  Nice guy who runs the pub and makes time to talk and welcome to customers
positive, My wife and i decided to start Xmas early this year and chose The Plume of Feathers for our Xmas meal - we were not disappointed I had the salmon and prawn starter and it was delicious - my wife had and enjoyed the pate We both had turkey and all the trimmings for our main - the vegetables were all cooked perfectly  the parsnips were my favourite  - it was piping hot loads of it and the turkey was tasty After a short break the trifle and cheese and biscuits arrived which we duly polished off but now we were both stuffed - but we still had more to come in the shape of a couple of small mince pies each Service was with a smile and very efficient Its a nice cosy pub too with a homely atmosphere So all in all - a great success If you have not been - give it a try - and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as we did Jim and Moira Stevenage 
positive, I visited with my family a little while ago We were feeling hungry and we spotted a sign for a little diner down an alley We looked at the menu which included cooked breakfasts snacks American food and the usual selection of drinks and we decided to stop by  The first thing you notice is the decorations on the wall The artwork is all based on comic book heroes like Spiderman and Wonder Woman My nephews are mad on these characters so they loved it I thought it worked well with the American diner theme The children were also given super hero colouring sheets with crayons The crayons were on their last legs but they still enjoyed it  The furniture overall was a little tired The carpet wasnt in great condition and the chairs while comfy enough we a little dated Overall the funky decor did enough to make it a decent place to eat  The waitress was very friendly and was very good with the children She seemed to be doing a lot of running around including upstairs to the kitchen  Perhaps they would benefit from another member of staff though I suspect that financially it wouldnt be viable  We were served in good time The menu offered a decent choice and the prices were reasonable When the food arrived it was very tasty I had a breakfast which was clean and nicely presented The children shared a couple of sides and the portions were good The tea and coffee were both good as were the milkshakes for the children  Overall we had a nice lunch here The decor lends itself to people with children who were kept entertained throughout the meal  The waitress was friendly if a little rushed off her feet  If I were to visit Truro again I would consider a return visit and I would probably recommend a vist for those interested in American cuisine as long as you dont expect too much from the decor  
positive,Me and my partner went to this Chinese restaurant because it was very near our hotel therefore convenient to get to  The inside of the restaurant is very nice and pretty but the outside needs a little modernisation or a new layer of paint to neaten it up a bit  The staff were friendly and easy to understand as well as accommodating so no problems in that department  The food itself was very good In my opinion Chinese food starters are the best and this doesn t disappoint I would recommend the barbecued pork ribs and the dumplings The noodles with the main course were very good not overly greasy like a lot of other Chinese restaurant do noodles  Overall an enjoyable meal would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Chinese food 
positive,Was very noisy when I visited however it was a Friday night but otherwise very happy with this restaurant 
positive, We had booked the pre-theatre menu which included a cocktail and had been tempted to have a dessert which we wouldn t normally do - great decision The starter and the main course were both really good but the chocolate mousse was one of the best I ve ever had - worth going back for just to get this It s a really good atmosphere in Hix and the food and service complement it - if you have time pop into the bar downstairs from the restaurant - very buzzy A great place all round 
positive, I have read many reviews about the rude attitude of the staff here In my opinion you will be treated the same way that you treat them and I was only ever treated with courtesy and a friendly welcome  The rooms are clean and tidy the breakfast is superb The menu for evening dining is fairly limited but that allows the excellent young chef to deliver beautifully cooked food every time I highly recommend this place for a stopover or short break 
positive, Visited with my girlfriend on a hot sunday lunhtime in June 2014 Arbutus offers a 3 course set lunch meal for 19 95 per person The food was nice with a nice balance of flavours and neat presentation It was not delicious but it was pleasant and I would recommend Arbutus however I would never have guessed that it had a michelin star based on the meal I had  I would highly recommend the cocktails which were fantastic and like the meal reasonably priced The service was efficient though lacked any personal touch A pleasant meal not exceptional but pleasant 
positive,We went at lunch time before a concert good value at 16 per head for adults and 9 for children however it is quite a lot more in the evening Great buffet selection of salads and side dishes really tasty and well prepared We enjoyed the various kinds of meat being served at the table found it all delicious and there was no problem with the speed of service however the restaurant was fairly empty Coffee was good too One point to make although they do offer a vegetarian option it is really a place for meat eaters would definitely go again at lunchtime 
positive, After I read the reviews I popped n for an early dinner with my wife The staff were friendly and chatty The burger was very good we tried rosemary chips and they were excellent We especially liked the milkshakes which came in some unusual flavours Salted caramel to die for Highly recommended 
positive,We passed the Firehouse grill when on holiday in st Ives and it always looked busy and had a good atmosphere so we booked a table they were very busy and we got a late table the staff were very friendly we ordered starters and mains the Posh burgers were lovely they cost about ten pounds with Stilton and red onion as extra but worth the money  A good night
positive, What a fun way to eat great relaxed atmosphere and exceptional food  Get your bibs on and get stuck in Great fun place for a date or with friends 
positive,A great retro venue for dinner on a Saturday night brunch on Sunday or midweek coffee and cake Food is always very good great selection of cakes and a lovely atmosphere Only negative is the venue is cash only and alas cash machines are few and far between on Lark Lane 
positive, The restaurant was very busy the staff efficient and friendly and the food was delicious The service was quick which is exactly what was needed as we were going to a show and did not want to be delayed 
positive, Marstons new pubs are really well designed with lots of comfortable seating areas with windows The service is quick and efficient with a good choice of menu The food was excellent and the Marston s Pedigree beer is as good as it gets 
positive, I visit for a friends birthday and there was a fairly large group of us we were a bit of a nuisance with billing and seating - The food is great and the atmosphere is too There s also wide range of selections for all appetites Jim who served us was incredibly friendly Thank you Jim 
positive, Visited this restaurant just before the Wembley FA final on Sunday 23 March Very clean Good food polite service and reasonable price I would visit again 
positive, We turned up at 10 45pm so felt a little guilty asking for a table  the staff were welcoming and friendly  I have previously been to Little Bay restaurant in Farringdon and had been impressed by the menu food quality and value for money This Brighton restaurant has similar selling points  Had the beef carpaccio to start - a nice texture of meat combined well with onion capers and some cornichons I had the duck confit for main course and Lucy had the fillet steak Everything was cooked perfectly well seasoned and tasty the sauces were full of flavour even the veg was good The profiteroles for dessert were good but we struggled to finish them  The whole experience was satisfying enjoyable delicious and excellent value for money I have never had such appealing food for the same cost  The atmosphere is intimate although the red heavy curtains are a little oppressive I cannot fault the staff even right at the end of their shift they were professional without exception  I definitely recommend this place and its counterparts in London for excellent food atmosphere and value for money 
positive, Went to Kungfu on a Friday evening 5 30 and booking advisable and had a 2 hour slot for eating Despite the place virtually full with a buzzing atmosphere we had more than enough time to eat our food We were helped and guided by a young waiter Adrian who could not have been more helpful Nothing was too much trouble for him Good selection of food - limited though if you are vegan vegetarian Dim sung were a little dry but all other dishes were adequately warm Sweets selection to die for I certainly think it represents good value for money and would not put anyone off from trying it Have to say that I had read reviews of Kungfu prior to my visit and some were not too good -rude staff cold food but at was not my experience Would I go again -yes  
positive, Wandering around Camden looking for dinner so used the tripadvisor app and saw the single review for this place so thought we d try So glad we did - we never would have found it otherwise and had excellent pizza lovely crispy thin base and pretty much any topping you could want Great value friendly service - just want you want for a casual but tasty meal that s not one of the chains 
positive, we went and had the all day breakfast and found it to be very tasty  well cooked and terrific value  Coffee is fresh and not to strong  just the way I like it and the owners who are also front of hohse are welcomming and obliging  the kids even get a complimentory lolly  Can t quite understand the review by Heacham girl  it seems at odds with our experience  and we ve been several times now  I d say give them a try and form your own opinion  I sure you won t be disappointed 
positive,steels is one Restaurant you keep going back to  great food great service the tables could be bigger  warm friendly staff
positive, Warm welcome from very friendly and helpful staff Lovely decor inside and comfortable lounge area outside Haven t visited for a while but been back twice in a week  
positive, Great atmosphere and quality food We will be visiting again in the near future  Great to see quality restaurants and micro brewery bars in Whitley bay 
positive, Post theatre nosh up Had the smallest Sirloin but it was sooo gorgeous The barman showed so little knowledge of the wines that I have dropped a star off but otherwise this is somewhere I can t wait to take my Date again And they very pleasantly arranged for us to sit side-by-side rather than opposite &lt 3  
positive, Without doubt a high class chippy For me the problem is that there is never anything ready and you order on entry which means that there is always a waiting queue for your food and it can sometimes take a long time which can be very annoying especially if you are short on time However the food is well worth waiting for excellently cooked and served with a smile 
positive,Food is tasty and portion size about right I ve been when it s reasonably busy and waiting times and quality goes down a bit 
positive, Popped in here for a business lunch and was very pleased with the speed of service and quality of food for the price Very knowledgeable and polite staff Next time I m in the area I will go out of my way to visit 
positive, Don t let the Fish and Chips put you off - this is a high quality restaurant with good food good serving sizes I never go for the large portions now  great service always clean and it s licenced if you need a drink I always order lightly battered fish my wife always have grilled fish with salad I have never been disappointed here and will always visit when in Shepton 
positive,As always the staff a friendly and the food is of a high standard I recommend going when it is not busy as the wait times can be long but that is in no way the fault of the staff as thy are a small family run business 
positive, A really warm and welcoming atmosphere with an excellent choice of dishes Also very good value We were with an Italian colleague and the Pizza got a big thumbs up from him which is a real recommendation 
positive, I can take or leave pizza but really enjoy the pizza on offer at Tradizioni Having looked through some recent reviews I am astonished by quite how many pizza experts are out there -- comparing these pizzas to Domino s or Zizzi s offerings is frankly bizarre As stated by many Tradizioni offers a particular not-thin and not-thick pizza base the like of which I have certainly eaten in Italy But all that aside the appeal of this place for me is that it is independent fairly priced convivial and the food comes fresh and fast It is not a place for lingering or to my mind a romantic evening it is a fun friendly clean unpretentious joint that does very tasty pizza good vegetarian options at fair prices I d far sooner eat here than in some tedious plastic pizza chain 
positive, First visit here   quite a small place but adds to the atmosphere We were 2 couples who sat at the rear part of the searing area We went for the set menus  all I can say we were unable to eat everything The food was fabulous if I must say one of our friends is a vegetarian and she really enjoyed what they had within the set meals Most certainly will be back   the reason for not getting 5 stars would be for the place being fairly small and compact  nothing more than than  great staff helped with the menu   
positive, Really tasty breakfast for a fabulously affordable price For a spoons the interior is above most spoons i ve been in Food gets there quick coffee is free refill in the mornings as well It s making me hungry now hopefully my Chinese comes soon then I can review that yay 
positive, Been going Derby Pool for years I really enjoy their food especially the BBQ chicken stack  They have a free salad bar available with every main meal purchased and refill drinks dispenser available with every fizzy drink purchased  Prices are very reasonable and staff are very friendly  Parking right outside and wifi available 
positive, This restaraunt provides a varied selection of cuisine from the mainly Indian menu The service is good with knowledgable staff who are happy to explain the menu and suggest appropriate side dishes The food was full of subtle flavours with nothing overpowering or over spiced despite having a byriani it was not a mouth burning experience but perfectly balanced Definitely one to return to - 
positive, Been going regularly for the last 3 years and have recently seen a vast improvement The new landlord is doing his best under difficult circumstances I personally can see the improvements and know of further improvements to come The food is now excellent and the waitresses are friendly and always willing to help Certain comments recently that I have read about this pub are grossly over the top and I think the people making these comments have a hidden agenda 
positive,I would highly recommend the Bloody Mary burger well actually any of the burgers  Generous portions and friendly staff I enjoy the humorous quirky menu however i wouldn t recommend this place if your looking for a romantic meal as it s not that pretty and has the odd old dog wandering about 
positive, We ate at the bar downstairs Fabulous Jamon Serrano and some nice white wine The guy behind the bar - Cameron was great and very attentive Good place to go 
positive, I went to the One-eyed Cat for our joint Xmas do and it was as I have ever found it excellent I have yet to have anything less than excellent food in this place but what always make it special is the level and quality of service It is friendly and attentive without being too much especially noteworthy on such a busy day 
positive,The food is excellent and rates highly with the family Family age ranges are from 3 yrs to 63 yrs Really friendly reception followed up with very friendly and helpful staff The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere which is great for enjoying a relaxing family meal  The meal was delivered fresh and hot and within a very acceptable time scale from ordering As a family we have visited the restaurant on 3 occasions and will certainly add to that figure An all round very good experience I would certainly recommend the Las Iguanas restaurant at Cribbs Causeway Bristol and just a few minutes drive from the Cribbs Causeway M5 Motorway junction 
positive,We ve dined here on our annual Cornish visits 5 years in a row Never had a bad meal or a bad pint The food is really top notch for pub food and the chefs obviously take great pride in their work Thanks again  see you next year 
positive, Tasty burgers at restaurant prices During the busy period of the Christmas rush Five Guys managed to deliver on flawless timing The unequivocally wide array of drinks to choose from are a must try but note large fries are for more than two people Would definitely come again perhaps on a less abundant day in a bit to experience a more  well prepared burger 
positive, As a large group of 7 adults and 4 children visiting Freshford for the first time our experience of lunching at the Freshford Inn could not have been better We were reserved a table in a side area which gave us space and privacy the staff were fantastically attentive and the food delicious and good value for money We would highly recommend it 
positive, Actually it was the night before Saturday 2nd April We were a party of six four adults two teenagers Our table s were in the centre of the first room making it slightly difficult on one side to pass until we moved the tables a little Most double & foursome s seemed to have more space On refection the window seating may have served us better That s our only complaint As for the service the staff were extremely polite and very attentive The food was plentiful My starter Smoked Mackerel one would expect a fillet there was three could have served as a main meal The other starters Mushrooms Garlic Soup Pate & Melon were plentiful The Main courses Steak Hake two Chicken & two Vegetarian meals were beautifully presented with ample vegetables We struggled to clear our plates One could not finish the night off without a Sweet to end a very pleasant evening Thank You Blue Mountain 
positive, Popped in here for a quick bite to eat Service was pretty prompt given there was a large queue for takeaway always a good sign  We had 2 x haddock and chips and 2 x pie and chips with a drink each which still gave us change from 30 for a couple of ice creams 
positive, Had a really nice cappuccino in here  and chocolate cake The atmosphere was really nice  especially as it was near Christmas 
positive,Recently visited this restaurant on a Friday night and was pleasently surprised Really enjoyed the food especially the Pavlova   Worth a visit and will be returning Try it 
positive, We visited and really enjoyed our meals which were of a good size and good quality The bar area is quite old fashion and hence quite quaint and friendly the only draw back was the large Sky TV which was showing football a level which would not have been annoying but there were a group of young men who were very loud and seemed to love the sound of their voices 
positive, From outside Tiger Bills looks like a theme restaurant and my Malaysian-born partner was sceptical whether it would do authentic Asian food We ordered from the Thai menu and when the food arrived it was quite authentic so I m told  and tasted great The staff were friendly and we enjoyed the meal 
positive, The service was friendly the food was great the view is breathtaking The food especially the drinks are very pricey though  
positive, Booked the 7 Square restaurant after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor We were not disappointed The food was excellent cooked to perfection by a knowledgeable chef We had the set menu s with wine and it came to 50 for the two of us Not bad for Warwick The only complaint I would have was that the plates were cold and that meant the food got cold very quickly Apart from that the service and the ambiance were excellent 
positive, Great place in a fantastic spot on the beach at Polkerris Easy going lunch spoiled by the service from our server who was dour and had forgot her manners Pizza was excellent and well recommended Dessert was great too  Would recommend booking in advance to get a seat as there is limited seating 
positive,This is a deli and a cafe and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised by my lunch here Cafes on the front and the main drag often don t bother making much of an effort but here they obviously care about what they serve Friendly too 
positive, We went to Chester on a very cold Sunday and went here for a coffee and sandwich Good service Good sandwiches not expensive for city centre Great little stop for a refuel and warm 
positive,Popped in Saturday Got seats at the bar Cheap prices Good atmosphere Nice talent I ll be back guys 
positive, First-time visit while on business in Liverpool a quiet Thursday evening but we had a warm greeting and excellent service throughout Prices are a touch higher than usual  but the food was uniformly excellent and they even prepared a dish that wasn t on the menu with no fuss I would very much recommend this restaurant though must admit there s nothing especially out of the ordinary about it but sometimes a simply very good Indian restaurant is just what you need 
positive, Attended with a large group - was impressed with by both the service and food Even though we where a group of 14 all the meals came out together and there weere no complaints with everyone thoroughly enjoying their individual meals We will definitely return 
positive, I attend the Priory Cafe quite a bit when visiting family The food is excellent and the home made items are lovely and much better than a standard cafe The service is a bit hit and miss depending on who serves you If the owner serves you then you are in very safe hands They do have a tendancy not to listen and forget to butter bread all very minor things I have not been impressed when they handle money and then making your sandwich without washing their hands again the younger staff All in all very good and a great cafe 
positive, Very nice breakfast good selection lovely coffee Very nice staff and good view of the green It s like gay Paris but in the West Country Zuit alors it s a proper job  
positive, Been there couple of times super friendly staff and good tasting food  Tried their lasagna its superb and a must  Looking forward to try new dishes next time 
positive, Not meant for large groups that I ve been able to see but the atmosphere was great for a party of 4-8 Food was delicious and there is a vast choice of beverage alcohol and non-  Very friendly staff Free Shuttle bus makes rounds to local hotels near Heathrow  Will see you again in a few weeks 
positive, called in today first time since reopening service was good had a meal from what they call the deck a twist to a carvey I guess best selection of draught lagers I have seen for a while and 6 cask ales will be going back again 
positive, It was busy but they still managed to service me very well the food was lovely priced at a reasonable rate 
positive, The food here is without doubt good food there s something for everyone on the menu and the specials all sound very nice Everyone in my party enjoyed the food here although the only downside is that staff aren t as efficient as in other places but they were still friendly Will definitely be back 
positive, Alright thats the limit of my french  My 3 friends and I went to Le Crepier Papin on Friday evening - my 3rd visit - the food was great the service was a little slow but they were very busy I dropped my fork and even before I had a chance to say anything the waitress brought me a new one The food was excellent and great coffee 
positive, I had a lovely meal and the service was fine There was no fault at all just a bit pricey but thats how it goes If the foods good and im all good 
positive, The food and service were excellent I have been on 2 occassions a couple of years apart one for xmas work do and the othe other for lunch with friends 
positive, We were both very hungry after a day off and a 5 hour visit to London Zoo It was quite early on a Monday evening but there were several other dinners We were seated quickly and had warm home made bread with hummus served straightaway which was very welcome indeed The whole experience was very good lovely food  i had a Spicy fish stew preceeded by babagnoush and my wife had Moussaka for a main and some filo cheese parcels as a starter Also had a bottle of very enjoyable Turkish Red Wine 
positive, Called in there for lunch this week Had some Tesco Clubcard vouchers to spend and we were shopping in Chester for the day Service was great from the beginning we were asked where we would like to be seated and offered drinks straight away All the food followed quickly and was of good quality All the staff there were really helpful and there was a good atmosphere in there Will be going again on next visit to Chester 
positive, Small friendly pub serving up good wholesome food Your typical pub grub cooked well and at reasonable prices  price range 8- 13  The kitchen is very accommodating and will taylor most meals to suit If you want chips with your chicken it s on the menu but if you prefer potatoes and veg then simply ask and it s provided The fact that the chef also happens to own the pub ensures that the food served is always to a high standard Good size portions means that on both our visits we could never manage a pudding which was a shames as they looked delicious Be prepared to have 5 6 locals always stood at the bar in the lounge dinning area A small corridor takes you through to the bar area complete with a small pool table a place we never neede to visit Can get busy particularly at weekends so it s probably best to book a table in advance and we re told a must for Sunday lunch As there s virtually no other pub in the village of Blockley eating in this pub every day for a week wouldn t be a problem Tip  try the Steak & Hookey local ale pie Delicious   
positive,we was doing some shopping in hessle rd and end up in this asda cafe in lunch time it so busy full house and need more staff to service the customers people wait quite long for foods
positive, Eight of us made the trip to Glossop last night to partake of a spice fest at the Ruchi and had a very enjoyable evening  Despite dealing with take away requests the service was first class and had very little time to wait between courses  Warm and crispy Poppadoms are always a good sign and often a benchmark to the whole meal  Starters were served in due course and following an acceptable resting time between courses the waiter asked if we were ready for our mains - nice touch and attentive  All meals served at one time and hot with excellent presentation and ample portion sizes  Complimenting the meal we shared a large Nan bread - and by large we mean large  At the waiters suggestion rather than ordering several small nans it was more economic to share one of their large specials  All meals were correct and extremely enjoyable and the final bill was not out of keeping with the standard of food and service we had experienced  All in all a great night for our curry club and a venue we hope to return to in the future 
positive,Very traditional pub with a real fire good beer and friendly staff well worth searching out Doesn t have a huge menu but what they do is all freshly prepared If you are after a gastropub experience this is not the place for you but if you want simple well cooked food in traditional surroundings this is the place to go
positive, This pub restaurant has had a change of management recently I think We were there for a wake which was very well managed with some imaginative and well prepared foor and good serivce 
positive, The food is nice enough and atmosphere Is good The price is expensive and to dine here it is costly The staff are friendly enough and check regularly for empty plates and drinks that need topping up Been here for a birthday celebration and the staff made it special Good for families and friends for a cheap meal out 
positive, Good food cooked to order and lighter early menu gives a good choice Looking forward to some new dishes this year More fish please  
positive, its lovely that Tanskeys has opened Friday Sat Sun nights this summer for a drink and bite to eat and to watch the sun set over the estuary on these lovely light evenings Nice choice of wines in particular For us it was a lovely way to relax on a Friday night 
positive, Waited about 15 mins to be seated which wasn t bad for 9pm on a Saturday night Service was excellent and food portions tasty and plentiful Will def return - 
positive,I have often walked past here and seen the menu on the outside wall A tenner for a burger you must be joking  My son studied at Leeds University and took me for a gourmet burger and I am hooked Have to say it was the best burger I have ever had It had to be I am the stereotypical Yorkshire man that only opens his wallet when I have too  I am a big burger fan at heart and will pay a tenner if it is a good one  If you go for a burger pay the extra for a large with a good topping and a dip as an extra for your chips The thin double cooked chips that come with the gourmet burger are rather special if you like that kind of thing I don t like those thick skinned wedgies that are often served in higher end restaurants so it was a great pleasure to be served proper thin and crispy double cooked chips with my burger The one s you get at NOS are superb  A word of caution You don t go here for the decor It s a student bar at heart But if you get students paying that sort of money for a burger it says a lot about the quality of the burger  Gets lots of toppings and a dip and enjoy 
positive, The setting of this restaurant is very good and this is reflected in the demand The service is good and efficient There is a good range of food and drinks and the seating is comfortable The prices are reasonable and overall the place can not be faulted 
positive, We found the khan Baba which is opposite the Science museum after being on the Coronation Street Tour We found the staff pleasant and attentive The food was excellent especially the delicious peshwari nan and a hotter than average Tikka masala and a tasty Chicken tikka balti Nice restaurant 
positive, Steak was over cooked asked for medium rare got well done The manager was great and gave us free desert and coffee It s a nice restaurant tho pianist gave it a great atmosphere and was very busy  90 for two with wine Give it a go it s worth it even if the steak is over cooked 
positive, I have been to the Seven Stars many times most recently for Sunday lunch The staff were very friendly the beer was in good condition and we had two very good burgers- plenty of good quality meat Good medium sized chips- I personally prefer French Fries- thin and crispy bistro style  My only hang up is that I always feel the bill is about 10 more than it should be Our starter of sough dough bread hummus olives and tzatziki was 7 50 The hummus was excellent as were the other ingredients A good place- I will go back as it is always full of fun people and has a great atmosphere 
positive,This is an out-of-the way village pub in a lovely location The garden is a wonderful haven during the warmer months and the bar eating area is nice and cosy during the winter with a logburner in an ancient firelace The beer is well-kept the food nearly always good and sometimes excellent nearly always as my wife once had a poor starter Wish I could remember what it was A terrine I think  The landlady and staff are always friendly and helpful and we try to visit at least once every few weeks always rewarding Well worth the effort of searching it out 
positive, We went there with a Tastecard which limits your choices quite a lot but the food was all very good and the decor is quite impressive too  We went as a pre-theatre meal and if you plan on doin this you need a good and a bit as there is a lot of food coming your way The staff were excellent about this as I mentioned it when we sat down so they had things worked out well so we could get goign on time 
positive, Great-looking food upbeat music and modern vibes Worth sitting outside before your meal for a cocktail overlooking the London skyline 
positive, We had a friendly welcome on each visit in a traditional country style restaurant with some character The food was very good from an atractive menu of English food The prices are not too expensive and we think they represent good value Easy to find with a large car park 
positive, A nice relaxing place to go for a quiet drink and a bit of downtime What else do you want from a pub 
positive, Ignore the look the shabby decor and the need to share a table with strangers The food is superb and cheap  You may have to queue but if you ve got time to kill before your train who cares Be patient and enjoy  
positive, Called in after seeing sign on A4 just out of Marlborough Nice pub situated in a quiet village Warm and friendly welcome from the landlady Good beers and wine I ordered the duck and was asked how I would like it cooked I asked for pink and it was cooked to perfection Very good service throughout and prices very reasonable Will call again when in area 
positive, Saturday morning breakfast just across the road from the Travelodge where we stayed Excellent quality and great value in a friendly atmosphere 
positive, I rode down from London with a friend as a personal challenge with aim of getting to Brighton for a well earned brunch and coffee  Lucky Beach Cafe on the beach front was our target destination and despite the driving rain we made it The staff were great and let us move some tables around to put our bikes safe- you can see why it is popular amongst the cycle community  Great brunch and really good coffee 
positive, Located in a stylish old pub building right at a set of traffic ligts getting access to this restaurant can be a bit awkward depending on your direction of travel When I arrived it was busy but the service and the food were first rate The owner keeps an eye on operations all the time and I have no doubt this contributes to the high standards I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and am pleased to recommend this restaurant I would go back 
positive, The second visit to this very welcoming pub cum wine bar cum restaurant opposite the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand and another very enjoyable lunch - one of the best Scotch Eggs in London made with a duck egg  followed by excellent cod in crispy beer batter and chips Something for everyone - both good everyday and fine special occasion wines guest and own beers - and a friendly and knowledgeable serving team led by the ever cheerful and enthusiastic manager Andy 
positive, Our first visit here after hearing good things Went with friends and were not disappointed Food was excellent with a substantial menu Servings were ample and service excellent My only criticism was that it is a small rest And so appears cramped Very little room between tables and no privacy Everything else makes up for that and we will certainly call again 
positive, Good and friently service always clean and reasonable prices The food is good but not great Worth it for some pub grub on a night out but probably not to go to specifically to eat 
positive, This is the best all you can eat restaurant I have been to There is a huge selection and variety of food from many different cuisines However although the food is good for an all you can eat in comparison to meals in a normal restaurant I feel the food is of average quality This was most apparent with the desserts with the ice cream in particular being very cheap Thus although it is good for an all you can eat I wouldn t rush to return 
positive, We had a really good food experience at Peachy Keens We were in the Travel Lodge next door and went in for Dinner My wife had not been in a Food Factory before She really loved go back and forth to pick the food she liked I really enjoyed the currys  
positive, Go here for the food not the service Although the service is pleasant it s just very rushed confused all over the place but you know what it adds to the charm of this tiny scruffy looking restaurant The food is the positive a massive positive 5star food 2 or 3 stars for everything else 
positive,There are a lot of cafes in Faversham but this in our opinion is the place to go for good coffee and a wide range of specialty teas The cakes are good too Not tried their other food yet but the menu looks interesting It is small and has an eclectic range of tables chairs and a couple of nice sofas - don t be put off by this This it is not a Jo s cafe They also have a courtyard at the rear where there are tables Good place to get talking to other people Good to see such a classy little joint making such a success of things 
positive, Stopped in here for a drink after going to Goodwood races V friendly pub Decent pint of San Miguel Dog friendly which is always a plus Would definitely go again if I was staying in the area Recommended 
positive, Great place & atmosphere Delicious drinks surrounded by a very chic crowd Everyone heard about the eggs shape toilets coming from a science fiction movie A must do when you visit London 
positive, The team really looked after us from the moment we arrived  Great local beer and the food was very good I had the hake which was very tasty My friend had the scallops which she described as really fresh  The icing on the cake was on our departure there were no cabs available It was a bank holiday weekend so it was busy locally Our fantastic waitress Lotty said as there were no cabs she would drive is back to our hotel Stunning service Thanks Lotty and team at the Polgooth 
positive,We were greated by very friendly staff on arrival for Sunday lunch I had the hamburger and my wife and daughter both had the Sunday roast Both meals were very nice The service was quick and friendly We sat in the ncie garden at the back of the pub We are very pleased to see our local pub under very improved new management 
positive, Visiting with family we were immediately made to feel welcome by the friendly bar staff and open log fire The waiter who served our table was pleasant and we were impressed with the range of food on offer from the two menus and a specials board Despite the size of our group the staff were very good with ensuring we had everything we needed and the food did not take too long either We came later in the afternoon so the restaurant wasn t as busy as perhaps we would have liked but the pub side had a number of people in it so the atmosphere did not suffer at all We had a thoroughly enjoyable visit and spent some time with the managers at the bar after our meal who we found to be rather lovely hence our surprise at some of the other reviews  We will be visiting again perhaps in summer to take advantage of the beer garden we spied from our table 
positive,Went to Northallerton on 19 November 2014 to do some Christmas shopping and my husband wanted a new all terrain coat so we decided to go to Sam Turners We were surprised at the size of the shop and very surprised that they had a cafe As it was lunch time we decided to stay for a bite to eat We had bacon brie and cranberry panini which came with salad home-made coleslaw and crisps It was delicious and very reasonably priced It was the first time that we had been to Sam Turners but it will not be the last As well as getting my husband a coat we had a lovely lunch 
positive, We visited the Jazz Caf€÷ yesterday on one of the hottest days of the year and the place was packed Having said that we ordered at the bar due to how busy they were and got served our drinks and food very quickly We sat inside while the jazz quartet played away and tucked into the amazing fish and chips they serve Good prices for the size portion you get and location  I feel that some reviewers are doing this great little find a dis-service It was busy yesterday and there were children there and they were enjoying themselves  Yes the music was a tad loud but that s what you get when you choose to go somewhere when there is live music- that s why it s called the JAZZ caf€÷   People come here to appreciate live music on a sunday  I understand the cafe s policy on buggies as these are big bulky and dangerous when waiters are bringing round hot drinks and food to avoid accidents  Ignore the negative reviews it is child friendly and a great find 
positive, Recently visited thoroughly enjoyed myself exceptional food great staff Would certainly visit again when in the area for work 
positive, We have been coming to Vallum for years The ice cream is always amazing and made locally The coffee is consistently good unlike some caf€÷s where a cappuccino is more like a latte On this occasion I had Pecan Pie which was unbelievable I have read some reviews saying Vallum is pricey It is at the top end for a cafe But is worth the trip 
positive, If you like Indian food mainly Nepalese here this is really worth a visit Good food friendly staff and sensible prices do book in advance as it is sometimes very busy 
positive, A great atmospheric Pub with plenty of charm friendly staff excellent menu with plenty of choice We have eaten here for many years and the Harbour Inn never disappoints 
positive, Dinner 24 May 2013 The food and wine were good as was the service Apparently it s usually full especially at weekends so you ll be lucky to get a late booking in the restraurant There some first come first served tables in the bar but early booking is best Take your sat-nav because the village is hard to find and escape from afterwards 
positive, Having been let down for the last time by our local we walked out and drove here to see what they offered What we got was a cracking burger friendly service and a nice quiet atmosphere It wasn t the quickest service and we were held up by a trainee learning the ropes but we weren t looking for fast food and the food was certainly worth the wait We will be back for more and have recommended to several friends 
positive, Fabulous choice of food greeted us and perhaps most memorable was the huge Salmon on display which was cooked to perfection The rest well you all know the drill great choice of chinese and indian food and then of course a very varied desert section 
positive,We met some friends of ours for lunch here This is an old pub with low door and ceilings but a really warm and friendly welcome It oozes history with its simplistic style and rustic charm It is a real ale pub with some very interesting beers and you are able to take the bottled one s away The food was excellent especially the bass that I had Each of us was very complimentary about the food which was flavoursome and nicely presented The location is excellent just a few minutes from the A34 and M4 whilst being just far enough away from them to provide a peaceful and tranquil location I would say that this is English pub hospitality and food at a high standard 
positive, not to be found in the centre of Worthing but slightly out on the Brighton road A good practical restaurant without the frills but with friendly and efficient staff and reasonable prices A menu of wholesome fish dishes cooked well and served generously plus a couple for non fish eaters and reasonable wines Certainly worth a visit if you are down this way 
positive, Just wanted a snack  Ordered teas coffees and cakes Then the assistant told us that if we bought the cream tea specials it would work out a lot cheaper  Plenty of seating toilets clean and fresh Had a lovely cream tea and friendly staff 
positive, Although I have to walk 20mins and past about 10 pubs to get here this is well and truly my local Friday and sat night are busier until the kids all head up to town centre but generally t is never too packed you are always able to get a seat and the staff are always friendly and efficient Sure there are snazzier Wetherspoons but this one has a bit of ambiance being an old church and is enough out of the town centre that it is full of quieter customers Thank you for many years good service George s  
positive, Just re opened Helpful staff good menu Salt and pepper king prawns fabulous We had the buffet menu  good value great food 
positive, As with most spoonies the food and the drink are good but I have had better in other branches The staff are normally super friendly and do a fantastic job especially when you consider that the amount of money spent on this particular pub must be at the lower end of the scale They do a lot with not very much to work with Its my local so don t take to much notice of the dates I visited or what I had when there 
positive, The beauty of living in Whickham is the plentiful supply of decent local pubs  The Bridle Path is friendly and clean good choice of drinks and decent atmosphere Food is just like any other chain pub you get what you pay for 
positive, We called in for lunch while sightseeing and shopping just the thing to rest our aching legs centrally located in the city which was ideal Ordered food and drinks at the bar food was brought in 10-15 minutes even though it was quite busy there Service staff and lunch were all good no complaints would go there again 
positive, While visiting friends in Bath I dropped in for an evening meal at Jamuna I ve visited before and the food is always of a high standard and the staff are very friendly and keen to please The service is very good and you don t have to wait long between courses Ownership of the restaurant is due to change hands soon so I hope the high standard stays the same 
positive, Our last night in York and another restaurant picked from reviews On first look the a la carte menu seemed on the expensive side for a small restaurant but the Fixed price menus offered grat value We arrived early and were shown to a table for four as restaurant was full However shortly after a table for two in a better location became vacant and we were invited to move another example of the service we experienced all evening The dishes we chose were all excellent and accompanied by a bottle of water tap brought to table and some good house wine The only negative was it got uncomfortaby hot as the only cooling seemed to be from two ceiling fans On the evening one was above a table occupied by a large party and they asked it to be switched off However we enjoyed our meal as we did in the other two restaurants we visited during our 3 night stay in the city and would recommend 
positive, Want to get in the mood for the Rio Olympics try the Carioca Restaurant for a taste of Brasilian Cuisine Turn right from the Underground tube station right into the maze that is the old Brixton market opposite Ralph gift shop and the Happy Dumpling is the little gem of that Carioca well frequented by locals and tourists alike It can sit a dozen inside and another dozen outside whereby a hot heater overhead makes you want to stay longer as you watch the world go by I tried the Bahia fish cakes and sweet chilli sauce by locals for a quick snack My partner chose the roast butter nut squash with red cabbage spicy chckpeas and chorizo salad all served by larger than life Martin the waiter Delicious This was washed down with a tongue tingling Raw fiyah the local ginger beer For those strong and hungry enough there is the Pele beef rib bun or Carmen the special Brasilian Bombshell burger 
positive, Called for lunch with my wife both our meals were good as was the service The standard menu offers a wide choice of meals and a lunch time special menu is available for 5 Monday to Saturday 
positive,This chippy is brilliant First class tasting fish and the chips are great Ate outside for some reason chips always taste better and to top it all the owner have my dog a battered sausage for free what more do you want 
positive, This is a fairly small cafe with a fair number of tables so it can be a cosy fit Having said that it makes for a warm atmosphere and I enjoyed it They server a cracking cup of tea and a scone that is of a decent size warm fresh and tasty 
positive, We are Ludlow residents and have a good choice for eating out As vegetarians this narrows the options for gourmet meals The Green caf€÷ is ideal 
positive, After hearing great things about Five Guys and seeing the Dayum dayum dayum video on Youtube I had to try the place out when it opened in Leeds  The first impression was very good it was clean and very much like an American fast food place in the US The menu is laid out in an easy to read way and the guy at the counter was very ptient as I got to grips with how to order  I went for a bacon burger and little fries with a soft drink you then choose from a selection of free toppings such as lettuce onions mayo ketchup etc I think that s a great idea as I am a bit fussy with stuff like that and normally have to request things are left off  They give you a receipt with your order number and you get your drink and take a seat until your order is called  The drinks machine is like something from Star Trek it seems to provide anything you can think of from one machine I went for Sprite Zero and there were then even more options such as Sprite cherry orange vanilla and more  When my meal came I opened the bag to discover that my little fries was far from little it was a very generous portion indeed and in fact I only ate about half The burger was delicious you can tell the meat is fresh and not frozen they are very much like Wendy s in the US in that regard and the bacon was super crispy in the American style  I was very happy and left very full sure it was pricier than McD s at around 12 00 but the quality was far above the slop they serve there As the old saying goes you get what you pay for  I would definitely recommend Five Guys and I am sure I will return the next time I go see a movie at the nearby Vue 
positive, Had a lovey steak and the 8 bottle of wine offer was a nice bonus Good atmosphere and an all round comfortable place 
positive, My partner and I had been wanting to try the Pelican Diner for a while now having seen some incredible pictures of their pancakes We finally got the chance to try it out and were very impressed The diner has a proper beach-side vibe The food is not overly cheap but the quality of the food is great so is worth paying the extra for MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A MILKSHAKE they are absolutely to die for I m so glad I didn t go for a coffee  The only reason my review didn t get 5 5 is because the service was a little slow which I don t usually mind but my partner s plate came up quite a while before mine did Pelican Diner also does not take card payments  I will be back for more pancakes and a milkshake soon 
positive,I visited this particular Turkish restaurant recently  in short very cosy  nice lighting  and great food It s a lovely place to dine would go there again for business and pleasure  
positive, Great range of mostly locally sourced food with some excellent seafood Staff are friendly and you are not crammed in Outdoor eating is fantastic with setting sun dipping below hills Overlooks marina 
positive, A backstreet pub converted to a Nepalese Restaurant It was slightly hard to find but very worth it  The food was tasty and very enjoyable  Enjoy 
positive, This is a good local restaurant that is very welcoming and friendly The food is good but not excellent however it is good value It was quite so no real atmosphere however this was probably due to very snowy conditions causing cancellations 
positive,Returning for the first time after about 12 years or more I found the pub almost unchanged and still a perfect example of the pubs that were once found throughout the Chilterns and especially on the line of the old Icknield Way By 1230 the pub was already busy with people who so evidently knew each other and there was a comfortable atmosphere - no music   but agreeable conversation Well kept beer and good food - only the Bread and Butter Pudding let them down and that was it was like the cake-like product sold in supermarkets instead of the crisp-topped fluffy and creamy pudding that it should be such a shame particularly because [having checked] all the on-line recipes are for the proper pudding  All the other food was plainly made in their own kitchen and a delight in consequence but maybe the sweets came in a van The furniture is well worn and space was tight but everywhere including the WCs was spotless So few pubs like this have survived that it was heartening to find it again - and though I now live in the Cotswolds not the Chilterns I intend to call in whenever I can 
positive, Clean pleasant and right opposite the holiday Inn Food good value even better Service lovely Just what I wanted 
positive, We went there every week for four weeks for steak night NIce friendly helpful staff no issues with meals and cheap with weatherspoons meal clubs including a pint A lot cheaper than London and was a very clean tiday and accomodating pub Always booked us a table for at least 20 and sorted out tables if more of us went as a group Cant fault it 
positive, Have eaten here on numerous occasions in small and large groups and as the family pub goes I think its great staff and management are welcoming and there is a good choice on the menu at sensible prices Food is quick and of good enough quality not the place for fine dinning or a romantic meal but a great place for a works outing or family get-together 
positive, The decor is a little dated but I cannot fault the food or service The staff were very attentive and always ready to answer questions The food was well presented and tasted wonderful I would not hesitate to recommend this place 
positive,We went out with another couple on Saturday night for a meal and had a good meal at a very reasonable price The pub always has a good range of beers and does a nice Pinot Grigot too Due to the amount of customers in the pub we had to wait 30 mins for our meal but were told this when we ordered it so there was no problem The bar area was busy at times however it was well staffed and we were served pretty quickly and the staff were friendly In addition when we had finished the meal the plates were taken away quite promptly This is a really good value pub and probably because of this can get quite crowded at weekends however we had a really enjoyable night out there The only negative was that the toilets could have been cleaner and probably need updating
positive,We have had lunch here several times this year and the food is always excellent and very reasonably priced The two-course set lunch is a bargain at only 5 95 Service is always prompt efficient and friendly  As the restaurant is situated on a busy road when the large windows are open and folded back then traffic noise can be very distracting  Well worth a visit and much better value than many of the restaurants in nearby Canary Wharf 
positive,popped in for drinks after a meal close by great selection of gins and knowledgeable friendly service heard lots of good things about it but wasn t clear on what the offer was they offer an ever changing selection of small plates do breakfast lunch and evening dishes a small space but wasn t packed so we were comfortable will definitely go back its on duke street so close enough to town but thankfully its frequented by humans and not some of the disasters you see falling around city centre drop by youll love it 
positive, We visited Fifteen for our 5th time and for all the same reasons Great venue Great staff Great food Great value for a Great experience especially fora family of 5 Always on top of their game in every aspect and we all know the Jamie O story but go and experience it too You will not be disappointed 
positive, We arrived at the White hart at 4pm not realising it closed at 4 30 However it wasn t a problem for them We ordered a selection of leaf teas sandwiches for the table & cream teas The sandwiches were lovely excellent fresh bread and a good amount of filling I had the earl grey tea which was a lovely refreshing blend My companions were equally happy with their choices The cream tea consisted of 3 small homemade scones with Tiptree jam and clotted cream Again very nice & the perfect amount maybe the scones could have been served warm The owners serving team couldn t have been more hospitable & they deserve every success If you re visiting Essex rather than just whizzing up the motor way stop and eat here It s opposite a lovely gallery with some of the fantastic art being displayed at the White Hart 
positive, If you want a good Beer in a traditional pub this is it Not only great beer good service reasonable prices it has a great atmosphere which is hard to find these days and a great beer garden too 
positive,Took my mother wife and four year old to the Quay Not much choice for the veggies tuna pasta was one however they service was good and the food we chose all served a purpose The wife had a Thai dish Pad Thai and said it was wonderful We ve made Pad Thai in Thailand before and would know if it was inauthentic as stated previously Fresh food served with a smile 
positive, Not only had our daughter graduated with a good 2 1 degree but had also been offered her dream job so we thought we would go out for a celebratory meal Northants does not offer many options for fine dining so we decided on to go to an old favourite in Harlestone The restaurant was busy on a Friday night but we were shown straight to our table at the time we had booked The service was friendly and efficient and drinks were served immediately and our order taken It was fish night and a good range of fresh fish dishes were on offer The scallop starter was excellent followed by a well cooked spit roasted chicken duck salad and sea bream which were all first class With a very nice bottle of Rose from the extensive wine list and pre dinner drinks the bill was a reasonable 125 including an additional tip A very safe location with a buzzy atmosphere - we have not had a bad meal there and would thoroughly recommend it 
positive, From the outside you wouldn t think much of the Hermitage Inn - particularly concerning food It s very much a traditional pub The feel continues inside but around the back there is a smart little restaurant  The welcome was friendly and we both chose the Rabbit Pie from the specials board The pies were excellent with a terrific puff pastry lid A good choice of desserts from the fridge and ours went down very well  Excellent value unexpectedly decent quality and very good beers from Jennings at the bar 
positive, Have visited there a couple of times and it is a lovely local restaurant in Reigate French themed with generous portions and well cooked Would recommend for special occasions as cant afford to go there on regular basis Sometimes they do 2 or 3 course packages which are good value 
positive, usually get take - aways from viraaj and its always quick and tasty at good value  wonderful indian food  one of my favourites in Sheffield 
positive,Great addition to little chalfont Sweet setting friendly service and great quality tapas Calamaris with chilli and garlic were a winner 
positive, Always a please to eat at Wagamama where the quality and choice of food is wide and tasty Situated close the the Odeon Cinema it s ideal if you are going to grab something after or even before your movie If you are a lover of Chinese or other oriental food then I would recommend this restaurant for it s choice of lesser known oriental country s cuisine 
positive, Bollywood lounge doesn t look much on the outside but on the inside it is wonderfully decorated giving a great dining atmosphere We too had booked the table with a groupon which I received as a gift and can say we didn t have any of the issues that other groupon users had  We started with poppadoms and a pickle tray which are standard in all Indian s I ve been to followed by the bollywood sharing starter This was delicious albeit small for a sharing starter which becomes a defunct argument by the end of the meal as we were all full  For our mains we shared a selection of curries with a couple of rices chips and a family garlic naan  All I could say is that the food was excellent all good quality with no issues  To concluded we had a great meal with great atmosphere I would however consider it slightly pricey compared to other great curry places in the area Even with the groupon which only covered our starter and curry our extras came to just over 30 The drinks are fairly expensive at roughly 4 50 for a pint of Cobra and 3 for a large coke  A place definitely worth another visit  
positive, We called in on a Friday lunchtime whilst on our way to our holiday destination St Ives  This was our second visit as we called in on our way home for breakfast last year Trevaskis came to us highly recommended last year primarily because of its range of desserts The lunch menu starts at 12 although they were happy to take our orders 20 minutes before kick off We opted for a lasagne which was piping hot freshly cooked and obviously home made The Jewel in the crown is the desserts counter for anyone that enjoys a good dessert this is the place for you  Trevaskis has a massive range of home made gigantic desserts and puddings priced at little more than a fiver   The cafe is is nicely decorated with high quality fixtures clean well run and is well worth a visit I would have given it five stars is they hadn t have messed up our bill charging us for more desserts than we actually had  In their defence they were very apologetic and refunded us very quickly once we queried the bill  
positive, We visited the Lendal Rustique without having booked We were found a table in a busy restaurant without fuss or delay The atmosphere was welcoming and there was a pleasant hum of conversation We were looked after very well by the two young people waiting at table in our area The food was well presented and tasty the house wine was perfectly good and the prices more than reasonable We had a thoroughly enjoyable evening Thank you 
positive,Went here last night after a day out at the football Booked in advance after seeing some good review on tripadvisor  Menu has plenty of options  first time I ve seen a mixed bhuna at a curry house  All 4 of us enjoyed our staters and mains would definitely go back again next time I m back in Hull 
positive, This is our local Indian & has always maintained high standards of food & service Staff are friendly & attentive  Always a relaxing enjoyable experience 
positive,Visited here with two small kids and was made to feel most welcome Plenty of things were provided to keep them entertained and the staff were patient and helpful The food is good if not particularly memorable although the rib eye steak was very tasty You wouldn t come here for fine dining but if you want a decent meal for the family this is a good choice 
positive, Great restaurant fantastic service from Angela and the team - food was spot on and hot enough for the regular curry admirer 
positive, I come here as often as possible I bring friends family wife and children - any excuse  A relatively recent find for me I ve been here at least 10 times since discovering it I love the tapas menu and the food is always great The staff are brilliant and the setting is amazing especially the courtyard garden area with it s vines and fish pond Brilliant - keep it up 
positive, Was pleasantly surprised Food of a very high quality clearly cooked by someone who knew what he was doing An imaginative and impressive but not over-comprehensive menu with rabbit pie loin of pork etc All standard fare and not too pretentious Very good value as well I would say that presentation might be a little better though maybe this would push the price up However very highly recommended 
positive, Big friendly pub excellent value for both food and drink garden right on the River Lee with moorings The Landlord even lets you take your bicycle through the pub so it can be by your side if you re eating in the riverside garden Handy for Rye House Speedway Rye House Go Cart Track and the railway station 
positive, All you can eat Brazilian with excellent service  Their food is above average And the selection is immaculate  Drinks are lovely and you can eat us Much as you wish paying around 30gbp  Excellent location and service as well  Definitely give it a go  
positive, We always enjoy the food here Usually pop in for lunch and never disappointed The only reason I enjoy shopping in Ramsgate 
positive,My partner and i visited this branch on the 16th of this month and the customer service from our server was exceptional it was clear that he took pride in his job I think he was italian He had a excellent relationship with all his tables 
positive, We stopped off for a couple of cocktails while out shopping for the day  The place is trendy enough with a good atmosphere and we were seated well on the veranda as the weather was nice  The waitress was polite and helpful taking the time to go through the cocktail menu and suggesting ones to suit our taste  thank you you were spot on  We really enjoyed the visit and we will see you again soon 
positive,I come to St Ives often and never have bad meal I would recommend but the fish batter was a tad to fatty for me but that s it The portions are large I was thrilled
positive, Being a huge fan of the Ruby Murray  there was no way I could pass up on what TripAdvisor listed as the 2 curry house in London The reviews mostly seemed positive so off I trotted to West Kensington to put this impressive rating to the test   Upon arrival with my prosecco in hand beer is way too bloating for a meal of this magnitude I was totally unconvinced at the building that lay before me the exterior was not one that I d typically associate with a high-end Indian restaurant let alone 2 in London  As me and my dining companion entered we realised we were the only people outside of the staff in the restaurant We had arrived at 6 40 40 minutes after opening on a Tuesday so whilst I didn t expect the restaurant to be full I expected there to be someone  After being seated a family of 4 was then shortly seated directly next to us which didn t help the feeling of claustrophobia the restaurant itself is without doubt the smallest I have been in - something the owner Rocky would later describe as a way of keeping things intimate and personal  Moving on to the food we started with two poppadoms and the traditional selection of mango chutney thicker than usual although this wasn t a bad thing  mint yoghurt this had a slight kick to it - very good  lime pickle pretty standard and onion I can still taste this the following morning   Next up was the appetisers I opted for the vegetarian option of Aloo Tikka which was a very bad choice Being a dedicated carnivore probably doesn t help but I didn t find the dish satisfying at all After trying my companion s Lamb chop which was very tasty and the right size for an appetiser I knew I had made the wrong decision  The restaurant was now filling up and close to capacity Despite my bad decision making with the starter I was starting to feel very optimistic about the mains to come  I wanted to try something different to the standard Vindaloo I often opt for so I went for a chef s special dish - Lamb Tawa  After consulting the waiter my companion was recommended - and opted to go for - their classic dish of Naga Chilli Massala  I accompanied my dish with a coconut rice & a garlic naan  The lamb tawa was in a word - awesome Thinly sliced layers of tender lamb were accompanied by a rich sauce and an optional green chilli which you can leave if the dish is too hot or devour if you want an added kick - I went for the latter  The chicken naga dish was also very hot and very good For anyone accustomed with the naga chilli - that distinct flavour is here in abundance  The rice & naan were both satisfactory although if I was to do the meal over a rice is to definitely be shared by two people   With the reasonaly-priced-bill came an After Eight mint which for me was a nice touch as growing up this was what traditionally accompanied the bill - not the mints or generic choclolates that are all too often served up as other restaraunts  The meal ended with the owner Rocky telling us about the history of the restaurant asking our names and pointing out the voice of Baloo from The Jungle Book was currently amongst the diners  Good food Great service And in the words of Arnie I ll be back 
positive, Every time I visit the capital the Liberth Bound always gets a visit Great atmosphere you can relax quite happily and more importantly you can hear yourself speak The food is the standard you expect from this chain and for the location very resonably priced My London a Local   
positive,Visited here whilst on a visit to London with my family Really nice atmosphere and food Also the staff were really cheerful and friendly The only thing we weren t so keen on was the fact that 10 of the meal was worked out and then had been added on to pay for the tips - so we didn t have an option of how much we tipped the staff This may be a normal thing to do in London however as we are not local to the area we are not familiar with this Overall a really good visit 
positive, I was recommended to eat at the Onshore and I wasn t disappointed Service was excellent and the set menu was very good Some of the best mussels I have had for a while I really liked that they had four choices of red and white wine by the glass I will definitely eat there again when I am back in St Ives 
positive, Nice atmosphere good food friendly attentive staff reasonable prices has live music events would go again 
positive,A bit up market from Waetherspoons but similar prices It is a Mardens House so your limited to Pedigree etc Very child friendly with inside and outside play areas It is really a pub pretending to be restraunt 
positive,Went there in May with my other half and went again last week on a staff retirement do I was very impressed both times and the food was brilliant on both visits I would definitely go back whenever I could As there was a big party we did have a bit of a wait for the food but it was worth it 
positive, If you are after a typical Indian restaurant then Viva Goa isn t for you that s because it s unique I had the Tiger Prawns with a delicious sauce and my partner had the pork vindaloo both exquisite tasting meals The service is impeccable too I d definitely recommend this restaurant if you are visiting York and we will be calling into Viva Goan again 
positive, On visiting Sidmouth I noted this had a great review on Tripadviser and gave it a try I was greeted with a charming and welcoming traditional Devon building with good parking Staff were available to order drinks on walking through the door We found several tables were reserved but found one free We decided to go for the carvery which appeared very nice on viewing with spotless food area While a friend paid for this at the bar a young waitress come to the table to inform me her boss had sent her over to remind us in future to wait to be shown to the table She appeared embarrassed by this but we excepted her comments The food was piping hot and a choice of three meats and help yourself to arrange of veg The staff were polite and appeared to enjoy there job This is well worth a visit and I highly recommend the carvery but don t forget staff need to show you to a table first  
positive,Friendly staff and a good selection of draught beers Mondays are the best value with all draught beers at 2 49 a pint  I have not eaten there on a regular basis but it is of a good pub-grub standard 
positive, Impression  Small clean simple but contemporary popular amongst Chinese customers which means authentic food  Menu list is short with photographs so very friendly for first timers to the restaurant and to Xian cuisine Surviving business situated right opposite the Emirates Stadium shows its doing very well for a good reason  Advice  They expect you to book a table first But if there s space they will give you a table preconditioning that you ll leave before a specific time The place is small so expect to be seated near other customers or even share a table They do not accept card payments They do not include service charge There doesn t appear to be toilets but then we didn t ask Price per item generally range between 7 to 10 the mains  They cook to order so food are prepared fresh Waiting times are reasonably fast depending on time of day Cup of water is free for now and is popular so ask for it  Opinion  Food is top quality and tasty Not like what you get from the common Chinese Cantonese restaurants Xian cuisine spice level is between mild to medium and nowhere near the levels in Szechuan cuisine Most dishes are pastry noodles with combination of beef or chicken Staff are friendly and helpful and seem to know their own menu items well  Will I return Yes 
positive, I d never actually been in this place as it looks somewhat chintzy from the exterior but having lived in Teddington for quite a few years decided to give it a try It s part cocktail bar part restaurant with a guy that plays the piano this was Saturday evening so you might say it has a quirk factor  We had a few drinks at the bar - some average cocktails - but because the place has such a friendly buzz especially with the guy playing the piano decided to stay and eat there The food was absolutely fine  We shall return either just for drinks or for drinks and food to re-sample the fun atmosphere 
positive,Chose and booked this restaurant via OpenTable because it was very close to our evening theatre venue Proved to be a great find and would certainly visit again  Very small upstairs and downstairs but that creates a friendly cosy feel Choice of talking to a helpful waitress or ordering anonymously via a tablet on the table We chose the waitress route but the photos on the tablet gave a great impression of the food  Limited menu but the food was freshly cooked and very tasty The LW burger was exceptionally good  40 for starter main and soft drinks - which was great value Next time we ll probably try the vodka recommendations as well  Only negative the upstairs gents could have been a lot cleaner  Recommended give it a try 
positive, Having eaten in several Italian places I must say that That s Amore is one of the few ones where I would go back to without hesitation The food is really good and their service is very friendly Would recommended to anybody 
positive, We went last week to this restaurant Two of us are vegetarians two not The vegetarian food was well cooked and interesting The two fish eaters said their fish and chips was outstanding Service was good the view over the beach in the evening was beautiful and it was not expensive All in all a good experience 
positive,Had a great walk over the hills towards Lyme Regis for 6 miles coming back to the carpark by the pub Fabulous crab sandwiches & local beer Just what the doctor ordered 
positive, I have been to this pub many times before and always felt a warm reception The new overs have been amazing with the occasional light live music that you can either talk to friends or sit and enjoy a book  The restaurant part was great with the wall being hand painted and meals that where just as delicate A fantastic reasonably priced starter and meal too full for a pudding made for a lovely enjoyable night with family and friends 
positive, Visited here last night with my sister & daughter and although it was very busy we were shown to our table had drinks & food order taken quickly and food arrived promptly Staff were very attentive Champers was on offer for 20 a bottle and most people took full advantage of it 
positive,We were welcomed by several smiling staff and offered the option to go straight to our reserved table or to have a drink first We made our way to the garden where we found a table in the sun and our drinks followed shortly After finishing our drinks the waitor came and escorted us to our table in the restaurant which was in a cramped corner He could see we weren t too happy and asked us to pick another table which we did There were several other tables in use and the restaurant slowly became fuller as the evening went on We wouldn t have noticed however as our waitor stayed attentive throughout and although the wait for our main course was long it was certainly worth it My wife had a lamb dish from the specials and I had fillet steak which were both cooked to perfection and very tasty I would however recommend having at least two courses as the portion sizes were adequate but not huge The waitor mentioned that champagne was on offer that night and we were recommended a 35 bottle that ended up being 30- a nice touch for our anniversary  Overall I felt very happy with the service and the food I came on tripadvisor to recommend the Greyhound and was astounded to discover all of the bad reviews I would say take them with a pinch of salt and find out for yourself- I shall certainly be visiting again 
positive,Hungry after the pictures heard it was good so gave it a try Friendly helpful staff lively atmosphere Good hot well presented food accepted on line 25 voucher i had pizza girl friend had pasta and meatballs both yummy will definitely go back 
positive, Kathmandu palace s not open for lunch but on this occasion they did open with no problem at all We had a great time even know I was unable to stay for the party as I was working but my friends enjoyed the atmosphere the food and the service Thank you again for your kindness we had a great time 
positive, We had a small bite to eat and it was nice The main bar is small but perfect Its quaint quiet and worth a visit in my opinion 
positive, Huge pizzas great prices good atmosphere and very friendly and accommodating staff for a family 5 years old s birthday party with all the attendant thrills spills and noise that brings 
positive, Very wide and interesting menu many fish dishes and the Venison was superb Rooms also good 
positive, We stopped into The Grace whilst house hunting in June It was Father s Day and despite being fully booked the guys found us a nice table that they could turn around in time The roast is top quality great meat and the trimmings were top quality We ve been living hear for 3 months now and still haven t found a roast quite as good and there are a lot of gooduns about  
positive, Went here for lunch today Had very nice bacon sandwich and pot of tea Good value and the lady behind the counter was very nice and helpful Would advise people to go 
positive, We had intended to eat elsewhere but arranging a table for eight on a Saturday night in Leeds os not easy   Our table was waiting for us when we arrived very short notice  Steaks were excellent and for a hotel restaurant keenly priced Many thanks for ensuring my little boy 30  didn t starve on his birthday night out 
positive, Jamie s in Norwich is situated right in the centre of town at the end of a beautiful Victorian arcade The restaurant feels welcoming with loads of character and design features creating a relaxed artisan-style atmosphere Tables aren t too crowded so you don t have to share your neighbours most recent surgical experiences and the table service is generally satisfactory and friendly Menu is limited but there are always specials to enjoy and the food is much better than you would expect from a standard Italian restaurant Value is reasonable - even better if you join Jamie s club which has regular offers and discounts Definitely a venue to consider 
positive, This was a return visit as ever the staff are very friendly and attentive the food is fantastic but the place is VERY noisy They could do with some acoustic absorbing panels on the ceiling 
positive, A great family night out at this restaurant the staff where very attentive and the food was fantastic I went for the specials menu for my main which was dover sole but they had none left and it was only 6-30pm so I had the lemon sole instead which was lovely and went towards making up my disappointment over the dover sole All the other members of my family were also very pleased with there food The staff are very warm and welcoming and couldn t of performed there task any better My only niggle with this restaurant was there are to many tables getting to the toilets was impossible without disturbing other diners and we where constantly getting disturbed by staff getting customers coats which where hung next to our table my brother who comes to this restaurant quiet often said extra tables add been added since there last visit I suggest they remove them which would make this place perfect Parking can also be a problem but that isn t the restaurants fault if you do go you can park opposite in the town hall car park which you can use in the evenings even though it doesn t say so I would definitely recommend this restaurant but you need to check where your been seated 
positive, We are in the Lake District for a week and have eaten at the Mortal Man on two occasions and both times the food has been excellent The main course quantities were extremely large leaving us no space for starters or desserts The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and there was a good atmosphere in the bar and restaurant 
positive,We ate at The Fox a couple of weeks ago and were delighted to find the original owners have returned I had an average dinner sulky service in the summer with my Mum and wondered what was going on This was not the same place I had enjoyed with my husband on previous visits But  several months on and The Fox is back  The pub is re-vamped Once more the atmosphere modern and warm Yes the menu is small - albeit delicious - while staff and kitchen find their feet and new systems fall into place Service was charming I ve worked in the hospitality industry and it s never easy  Especially a re-opening We drank Negroni s at the superbly stocked bar run by an expert bartender ate gorgeous food and basked in the glow of this establishment s return to glory 
positive,Decided as a family to have a pizza night Original plan was Dominoes but decided to give here a go as they re just around the corner  3 very nice 9 5in thin crust pizzas and garlic bread pizza for under 20 and to be honest they where worth every penny  We certainly won t be going anywhere else in future for pizzas
positive, I was in a group of 12 so as you can imagine finding a cuisine everyone liked was tough Then someone suggested Jimmy Spice s as it has a selection of Asian European and American food types We went in and were greeted by very friendly staff The night we went Friday seemed to be a fixed price for unlimited food type of deal  15 is not a lot of money for all the food you could potentially eat  The plates are tiny so I had one plate of Indian food and a plate of Chinese Both of which were tasty for the most part  Especially liked the salt chicken and the fried beef  We re not talking formal dining here nor will we see Michelin stars but the food was pretty decent with a generous array of vegetables meat and spices in all the dishes I tried  In all I think everyone in our party enjoyed their food the restaurant had a friendly atmosphere and staff were helpful and quick to respond If you re looking for a well priced varied place to eat in Birmingham with a little something for everyone you may want to check here  Could also have Sushi pizza pasta dishes salads tex-mex and many others  
positive,After eating a lunch at this restaurant I took the plunge and booked an evening meal for 4 of us to celebrate my birthday From start to finish the service and food was exceptional Nothing too much trouble and Cazz the waiter was attentive without being overbearing Will definately return the sooner the better Ramsgate has a rising star in Il tricolore and it deserves continued patronage 
positive, Myself and my partner stopped here having abandoned our soon to be out of fuel vehicle The staff were very friendly and it was easy to converse with them clearly being happy to welcome in tourists  The pub had quite a local feel and was dog friendly with no less than 3 dogs seen sitting besides their owners The was by no means to the detriment of the venue which is quite spacious and spread out  The food was very reasonably priced and had nice feel of being home cooked with an attempt to be a little bistro I don t know if this was intentional and it didn t quite deliver in that respect but there is no disputing it delivered on what was expected which was good quality pub food  I would advise that if eating the Exmoor Burger it is quite a considerable size and you won t be disappointed My partner had bass with a lobster sauce which she also said was very pleasant  Drinks were also very well priced so this was a really nice surprise when it came to paying  Worth a stop by either for food or if this happens to be towards the end of a walk you find yourself on 
positive, I had not been to Nicks Diner for years and years probably 15 and possibly even 20 years I use to live a couple of mile from it when the old A11 road was still the main road between Norwich and Attleborough Which to non natives of the area would be the first problem actually finding the place  Here is a hint if you follow the signs for the college and get yourself to Morley you won t go far wrong Although there are still a few windy twisting roads to negotiate there is usually no shortage of people to ask When we arrived all 7 of us we asked the staff if they would hold the cakes behind the counter and they did so with no bother at all Just a point to note if you are taking Birthday cakes along with you whilst they will bring birthday cakes to the table we were told that they would be unable to serve them as they were very busy and that s fair enough  The waitress was excellent and attentive and took our drinks and meal orders promptly and between the 7 of us we ordered a wide range of starters and mains and here is another hint unless you have a bottomless belly choose your starters and mains carefully to leave room for dessert as the portions of both are excellent in size and very filling A word to the wise it is predominately Burger driven but does have limited veggie options A big plus they have WiFi and display the password which was great cos I could send pictures and very favourable comments about the food out onto my twitter account It disappeared just after 9pm though might have been that the usage had maxxed out or as the restaurant was so busy too many people were using it I could go through each item that we all had but there is really no point it was all delicious plenty of it great quality and excellent value for money I will definetly go back there and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is into Burgers with style  
positive, Restaurant was very clean with a nice ambience our waiter was friendly and attentive My wife had the fillet steak which was superbly tender and altogether excellent I had the Wagyu beef which at 55 with a portion of chips was seriously overpriced in terms of the eating experience There was no sign of the expected marbling in this steak nor was it especially tender or tasty There was an area of inedible gristle at one end that had to be abandoned For this money I expect something way better than this Will also mention that the plates were not properly heated The chips were some of the best I have ever tasted 
positive, We went here weekend of 29th June on a Living Social voucher and paid 25 for a Room upgrade When we return we will not be paying for the upgrade as although this does keep up in the old main building the rooms are a little tired Overall we enjoyed our overnight stay and the dinner was very good and you just chose off the main menu which was excellent The drinks were a little expensive however for just a short walk you could save up to 50 on these prises as there are numerous [4 6] Pubs within a few hundred yards The atmosphere was good restaurant nicely laid out and relaxing and the staff were all extremely helpful and pleasant We were definitely impressed with our stay here which is in a lovely location and will definitely be going back again in the future 
positive, It was quiet when we arrived at this small restaurant just one table occupied with fellow tourists However the menu looked good and the wine was reasonably priced So after a long day we had a great meal and i was very impressed with the tasty nan bread but they were small so i had 2 as the waiter warned me they were small Not the most atmospheric indian i have ever been to but it was just what we wanted having been out all day 
positive, Bedroom although comfortable was in desperate need of an update The decor doesn t appear to have been changed since the nineties This was disappointing as the restaurant appears to be stylish in decor The bathroom was poor mould in the window and on the grout As the hotel wasn t full I would have appreciated a better room 
positive, Great place and fab location We were lucky enough to sit out on the balcony on a sunny day Beautiful views and great food - I had the veggie breakfast  [i recommend the Dorset tea earl grey Really good ] 
positive, Popped in for a coffee and a pizza slaice Absolutely wonderful Lovely strong Italian coffee with a slab of gorgeous cheesy T pizza 
positive, My wife and I enjoy Prezzo s so gave the Port Solent one a try and found this was up there with the best around Sevice was first class and the food was great plus with a taste card got 15 off the final bill 
positive, On a busy street corner just before Brighton s famous pier lies Very Italian Pizza- otherwise known as V I P  While unassuming on the outside this quaint little establishment offers up some of the finest casual dining in Brighton From pizzas and calzones to pastas and salads the range of dishes on offer is decidedly standard fair with perhaps the mini- empanada style calzones being one of the more unusual items  Yet it is in the sheer quality of the ingredients the fresh sweet and herbal passatta the stretchy and luxurious mozzarella and the voluminous and tasty dough where V I P excels  With high providence cured meats from pancetta to prosciutto and a truly excellent standard of olive oil- most especially their homemade chilli oil- any dish can be purchased with full confidence  Nonetheless yet rightly so most people will come to V I P in search of their pizza fix and honestly after having dined here it will be a fix that is satisfied for quite some time  V I P pizzas are truly enormous Rather than the standard radial style here we have vast and robust platforms of pizza bread  adorned of course with passatta mozzarella and your choice of toppings  One could accuse V I P of using too much cheese and not enough sauce but this seems to depend largely on what type of pizza you order I would personally avoid going for a white pizza as the lack of tomato passatta may leave one yearning for moisture and sweetness among a palate of pure savoury saltiness  With a properly balanced pizza however V I P is truly excellent value and will most certainly satisfy any pizza lover  On a busy night the fastidious owner with her small militia of quintessentially Italian waiting staff will do their best to keep up with demand as hordes of hungry pizza-lovers jostle for position in a tightly packed yet traditionally adorned premises All manner of Italian items of produce line the shelves of the restaurant and there is a mini deli near the kitchen where excellent quality pizza bread can be purchased standalone for as little as 1 a loaf  It is must try for pizza lovers and a great overall experience that won t burn a hole in your wallet Fantastic 
positive,Good meals well served by friendly staff especially considering that it was so late House wine that I would recommend The current management have really improved things 
positive, Went here previously when it was The Beeches - so booked up ad hoc on a Saturday  Web site told us no tables available until after 8pm undeterred we rang and they took our booking no problem  Arrived and it was only half full great welcome and pleasant entrance  bar area  Nicely appointed inside and staff very friendly  Has the feel of a family owned venture as all staff eager to please  Great food nice variety on the menu and the kids loved it too  Definitely worth a visit in my opinion 
positive, The place has been super popular for ages and we have been hearing rave reviews about it so when an opportunity arose we decided to give it a go General impressions when you walk in  really underwhelming   It does look like a restaurant stuck in the nineties the staff looks rather bizarre and not modern at all but the menu delivers on the traditional Italian food  and after all that is what you come for to an Italian restaurant The portions are humongous so it is a very good idea to go as a larger group and order fewer portions than there are people and share everything  and feel like a large Italian family on a night out The food itself is all good  nothing super extraordinary some things are great others just OK - guess it s just like Mamma used to make and again it all feels very homemade and very generous Good pizza good fish desserts just so-so All in all I would highly recommend going there especially with friends and family One tip  do not wear anything that is hard to wash  like suede or leather  all your clothes will smell of food when you leave the place  probably the biggest issue with otherwise lovely Il Bordello 
positive, I go down to the Britannia Inn regularly and am familiar with the staff and the management Darren the manager keeps a good pub here with a consistent high quality of drinks and various hot foods I know people occasionally complain about waiting times cleanliness and food quality but lets be realistic This pub was opened many years ago temporarily as a venue for the Liverpool International garden festival and thankfully was allowed to remain as a watering hole for locals and the many passing visitors to Liverpool Yes there are some issues but im aware that budget restrictions and quites simply the footfall passing through this pub on a daily basis sometimes is the cause for some slight lapses in regard of high quality achievement The bottom line here is the pub is extremely friendly with hard working staff and management the food is of reasonable quality at an exceptional price and the beers and drinks are always well prepared and served with a large selection of branded names The pub is very appealing and particularly friendly to disabled people who are treated with great respect and consideration with the pub having good wheelchair access too  With the fantastic views outside  i sit out every time i visit  you couldnt get a more satisfactory experience at such value anywhere else in the city So lets stop griping and realise that the Britannia Inn is doing a great job overall in keeping both regulars and visitors happy in so many ways that the occasional issues that can occur i could forget in a heartbeat Well done Darren Lisa Josie and all the staff who have kept me and my wife as well as thousands of others so well looked after for so long   
positive, Ordered through Deliveroo and gotta be honest was pretty cold when it arrived that being said the pizza was next level mrs warmed hers up in the oven I ate cold and it was still a 4 star pizza  
positive, I went here with some friends and we collected our food very quickly ok Food and nice atmosphere I would recommend this place 
positive,This was my first visit to The Cosy Club The service was friendly and we didn t wait around too long The other members of the party enjoyed their meal I ordered Tapas which was nice One of the Tapas dishes I did not enjoy but to be fair that was more down to personal taste than quality The waitress noticing I had not eaten it offered me a complimentary coffee Although I didn t take her up on the offer I thought it was a kind touch I will be returning with my fianc€÷e next time we re in Bath 
positive, This cafe is a small and appears to be family run establishment just near the harbor car park in Bridlington We stopped by last year and were amazed at the size and quality of our breakfast for the price So much so that when we returned to Bridlington this year there was only one place to go No fancy decor or frills but for good quality excellent value food you will struggle to beet it And they have even added brown toast to the options It must be hard to survive in a small town with so many cafes but they are really welcoming and friendly and offer great value 
positive, Had three meals at Bettys during a recent 2 night stay in Harrogate First was a lunchtime visit when we queued outside for ten minutes then a further queue inside We had tasty club sandwiches and a plate of chips We returned in the evening recommended when it was much quieter had a nice meal with wine and a pianist playing  They serve until 9pm  Third visit was the following day when we had the traditional afternoon tea but this involved a further queue We were fortunate to have a window table on each occasion the food quality and service were very good 
positive, My friends and I - we are all writers and one a former food journalist - fell upon this small restaurant by accident and it was a pleasant surprise Greeting and service was nice throughout The situation is great - we had a table overlooking the Harbour on a beautiful sunny winter s day it felt like New England Delicious calamari to start followed by the seafood platter shared by two - the high point of which were the scallops which were to die for The only minus mark sadly was for the coffee which wasn t good Otherwise I d be happy going there again Added to a walk along the sea front it s a perfect day out even off season 
positive,Slightly formulaic menu but reasonable prices for the area and tasty food We had the halibut which was tender and only issue was I prefer it to have a crispy skin Service was prompt pleasant and polite Good atmosphere busy and popular Not a gastronomic experience but wasn t expecting it to be Handy for a bit to eat after shopping perhaps 
positive, I have here before but I fancied eating at home  I picked a menu for two which comprised of a good selection of mixed staters about six starters each  For main there was Rice  a Chechen dish  a hot Beef dish an a Pack Choi with noodles  All good sized portions  All this for only 25 00 for two persons  Great value and very tasty  The order arrived on time and was well presented 
positive, The landlord and landlady are very nice as and welcoming as where the people in the bar the beer was excellent I did not eat there but the food looked very good I am from Lancashire but the crack was very good to I will be back there soon 
positive, We have dined here on several occasions while visiting relatives There are 2 areas the original pub with fairly typical tables and a cushioned bench along the window wall with chairs on the other sides of the tables This all seems quite cosy and comfortable There is also a modern extension with tables and chairs that seem a little more formal I have never been able to fault the food here - it has always been excellent They change the menu gradually over time but there are always some favourites such as steak gammon steak sea bass as well as delicious home made pies which are available in small or large portions  the latter being very generous  Likewise there are plenty of tasty starters I would say the sweets are good rather than excellent My only reason for awarding 4 stars rather than 5 is that the service can be rather slow when it is busy I don t find this to be a problem but if you are in a hurry it could be Pricewise I feel it represents very good value All in all highly recommended 
positive, Nice pub in famous Chapel Street Provides good fancy dress Balls and has an authentic atmosphere Further down there is the interesting Admiral Benbow and the Penzance Arts Club Keep going if you can to the Lock Inn and the Yacht Inn after your visit 
positive, Could be quite noisy sometimes but I forget the noise with the very nice Menu they have for the Brunch on sunday   Even the coffee is good which is almost impossible in London  
positive, Staying in hotel round the corner so really convenient Friendly welcome Nice atmosphere with friendly and attentive staff Had the London set meze for 2 and weren t disappointed Washed down with a Turkish white About 50 which given location round corner from London Eye we felt was value for money Would definitely go back 
positive, As there is a lot of buffet restaurants to choose from in manchester this one has to be up there with the best lots of selections and very nice food we were a group of 11 so were pleased to be sat as a group which usually isn t possible so definitely be eating here again in the near future 
positive, We have dined at this resteraunt before two years ago so whilst wandering around Windermere looking for somewhwere to dine as soon as we spotted The Lamplighter both my wife and i said  we ll go there so we did That in itself tells you what great food they serve We both ate off the special board which can be expensive but delicious but there is a superb menu with meals for all budgets I had Sea char and the wife selected Sea bass both were cooked to perfection as were our desserts To assist the less knowledgable wine drink like myself The number of the complimentary wine to each meal is placed alongside it on the menu whcih we thought was very helpful The waiter and manager were also very friendly and helpful and we didn t have to move a muscle all evening other than calls of nature It was a lovely evening in a truly lovely resteraunt The first visit we had another family with us and eight of us celbrated my 50th birthday here We saw the place in the afternoon and reserved a table We had a lovely time agai and even the kids didn t have any complaints The waiter also recommended a very tasty port to compliment our cheese and biscuits which went down very well If in Windermere i recomend you eat here as you will love it  
positive, Good value for money never leave hungry and decent BBQ Cocktails weren t too expensive and were an unexpected highlight 
positive, Great atmostphere great craft beers  the fish pie is really tasty however the meal a tad small so had to purchase some fries to fill the void  great for a works meal and just lunch 
positive, Great three course meal a set menu with a selection of choices for starter main and dessert A different standard of food compared to your normal chain pub grub fare The drinks are excellent as were the staff and the refurb of the pub itself was of a good standard this does reflect in the prices though so a place to go for that something special 
positive, I m not saying this place is on par with a good restaurant but for something different for a takeaway I d say this a must if in the Hillsborough area  Healthy in comparison to other takeaways not too expensive decent variety friendly staff  Don t do delivery though unless it s over 25 over lunchtime  
positive,Nice place to eat Very friendly staff both on food and at the bar Full of little hide away places not an open room Food was good service was good atmosphere was good Would I recommend yes no problem 
positive, We dined here for a family reunion having travelled from Chester All eight of us enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and thoroughly appreciated the food choices many of which we ate We were taken care of in awesome style by our friendly host Marcelo who was excellent  Good cider too  
positive, Great little find First visit will go back for sure Authentic family style Italian good value Calamari was delicious and I think we may pop in for lunch one day to try a pizza as they looked fantastic Service friendly and there was a nice buzz in the restaurant 
positive,We travel across town to get our fish and chips from here my family have been eating from here for well over 20 years Always fresh and tasty
positive, It s small It s very cosy It s fairly new    and it s very French The immediate impression is of a crisp well run establishment You are greeted in French - not forced Allo Allo  - and before you know it phrases that you may not have used for decades find themselves tumbling without embarrassment from your lips Oh Yes then there s the menu which is small and also very French It proudly tells you that the Fish and the Meat are sourced from shops in Chester Market but even the pats of butter are French We declined a starter and my partner ordered the Sea Bass I the Entrecote with a side of Haricot Verte Delicious bread is served and we chose to have an Oil and Balsamic dip The wines which by now you won t be surprised to read are all French are subtle and the proprietor is knowledgeable and willing to suggest the appropriate wine for your meal We both found room for the Crepes Our meals were thoroughly enjoyed and were served at a gentle pace The close proximity of ones fellow diners was not the problem I d expected We ll be back 
positive,I had some friends visiting and thought it would be nice to go out for Sunday breakfast also saves me the washing up We decided on BTP as I had heard good things about the breakfast there and they were right the breakfast was great We had to wait a short time until a table became available which I took as a good sign and didn t mind Sadly we went back on another occasion with some other friends because our first experience was really good This time we went in the evening the place was half empty and the main meals were shockingly bad   note to self BTP for breakfast not dinner 
positive,A really unique pub with amazing internal decor wonderful bar shaped like an old galleon ship and you can smell the wood mixed with the hoppy smell of ale excellent The was a rugby match on so the landlord was in full voice for his beloved Wales and it all added to the atmosphere he even did a free bbq for all the punters where do you get hospitality like that these days Had a really nice pint of one of the pubs home brewed ales and my pal had some local cider She we were well fed and watered while soaking up the atmosphere Wales won so it was even better 
positive, On a wet and cold Jan 1st the service at this pub restaurant was excellent The food was of a high standard   
positive, If you are expecting the usual Indian food don t go here this is something totally different Another Type of food altogether  Def go again 
positive, Atmosphere is like a pub in the pub area but fine dinning in the restaurant with a great garden when the sun is out Good selection of meals and Great service 
positive, A tight squeeze but very popular limited space so sometimes you can t get in Food is very good much home made especially the cakes If you can t get in try again 
positive, A few of us from work decided to try and break the laws of nature by going to TGI Fridays on an ACTUAL Friday Disappointed to report nothing happened and the universe remains as was  Onto the visit Came with 5 colleagues and we suspected we should have booked ahead but it was no problem at all The staff were all really nice and friendly and a special shout out goes to our waiter who was friendly knowledgable and had a slightly scary fascination with Minions he was a grown man but very funny nonetheless  I went for the chicken fingers not actual chickens fingers whilst my colleagues went for things like the hot dog massive the burgers looked good and the veggie option who knows  The drinks came quick and were regularly topped up and the food arrived speedily too  All in all not quite the party-haven I remember from my youth but a great place to go for an affordable meal with friends or colleagues or both if you are that kind of team  
positive,This has been one of our favourite places to have a drink and food setting is really nice you can sit out and look out over the village of Diggle You can walk along the canal to Uppermill or stand on the railway bridge and see the Standedge railway tunnel which is one of the longest in the world The hotel has just been refurbished and a really good job has been done the new owners are very nice and helpful several real ales are always served one being a local micro brewery The food is very good and value for money this is a perfect place to stop after a walk along the Huddersfield canal Rooms are also available if you want to stay over at very good prices 
positive, gosh the chicken dish i had was first class with chunky chips kind of food i like My wife had prawms and she managed to clean the plate 
positive, Have ate here on two occasions once on an evening another Sunday lunch Both times the food was of a very high standard The Sunday roast was gorgeous meat was tender gravy rich loved the red cabbage cut through the rich gravy lovely Service was good decor was good as well more so if you like the colour purple  Overall great experience and as a diner your looking for confidence in food when you go out and you certainly get that here thanks 
positive, Given some of the negative reviews i was a bit uncertain of what to expect - however the food was very tasty and freshly prepared and some of the most authentic Thai i ve had in a while Reasonable value for money and service was excellent - if i m in the area i would certainly go again 
positive, Good Beer good beer good beer good beer good beer good beer sorry but had to use 50 Characters to leave review lol 
positive, Relatively short menu but enough for most tastes and everything done well Service was personal and friendly Surroundings were well thought through and welcoming The starter platter was tastey and the burger full of prime beef Well worth a visit 
positive, We had different starters Prawns with Smoked Salmon and Black Pudding with Blue Cheese both were excellent Good portions and very very tasty I had a rump steak my wife had the Gammon both were excellent the chips were the large hand cut type lovely Service was good and the staff very friendly 
positive, Was in the area for a wedding over the weekend and visited the pub twice Once for drinks on Saturday and for a meal on Sunday evening Both visits were really good and the patio area out the back has lovely views Meal on Sunday was very good has one of the sharing plates the salt beef salad and a flatbread of cheese and caramelised onions baked in their own pizza oven All food we had was really nice well cooked and presented Service was also efficient and friendly 
positive, Excellent service amazing food and fantastic value for money Would highly recommend and we will definately be going back 
positive, Rum punch is delicious & so was the food Plenty Of choice on the menu Friendly service Good atmosphere 
positive, Good choice of food available averagely priced minimal Beer Wine offered which is a little higher prices than normal  Overall a great place for lunch 
positive,Customer service was bang on Atmosphere was relaxed and peaceful the restaurant itself is stunning Dimmed with candle lights spaceful and elegant Recommended wine was beautiful and the food was stunning I had a chicken dish served with potatoes could of been better with veg but didn t take the taste away My boyfriend had the jerk chicken and said it was also beaut Would definitely go again when visiting liverpool 
positive, Stopped in here for a quick bite before heading to Manchester the staff were very friendly and food was fast hot and tasty love it 
positive, We moved to the area a couple of years ago and have been doing the trot to Carshalton when we wanted a decent pub We ve drunk at a couple of the group s other pubs so we had high hopes and so far we ve not been disappointed Decent array of ales and quite lovely staff We ve done a couple of evenings and it s been nicely busy And a couple of Sundays there with the kids   The pub is big enough that you can have children there without getting on people s nerves So far we love it  leaving the fifth star to be added if they get the kitchen right 
positive, Clean enough room and shower was fine for one night Quite small but OK for the price Very noisy outside though as it s a busy road and late at night people going home drunk so if you have a room overlooking the front it could be a problem Limited parking but I got a space so was fine   Best thing - amazing breakfast Nice people too Would stay there again 
positive, I think I got taken to this pub when I was much younger and living about 20 miles away Since then I ve grown up a lot and moved to Huddersfield and now live about 10 minutes away Always a good meal here I ve never been and left either dissapointed with the food or service or felt like I was still hungry Thoroughly good value for money and would always come here for a carvery over the Toby down the road 
positive, I visited on a Saturday for lunch and was impressed Although it was fairly quiet I found the service to be very efficient there s an open kitchen where we watched the only chef tossing pizza dough into the air and generally moseying around in true Italian style The had a great atmosphere consisting of good music  mainly Dean Martin  attractive d€÷cor and furniture The place was spotless even the toilets if I may be as so bold to say so  I had the Pannacotta to start which was delicious the bread was clearly freshly baked and a pizza for the main which matched the starter in its quality  It wasn t cheap but not too expensive considering that it s located in the city centre 
positive, A very nice a welcoming atmosphere this is probably the best Wagamama branch I have been to and their chefs made some great food for us The flavours were as good as I ve tasted in any Wagamama and our waiter named Paul was extremely pleasant and made my girlfriend s lunch very enjoyable for us both he even sang happy birthday  I very much recommend the duck ramen which tasted delightful and the white chocolate and ginger cheesecake 
positive, We have had a coffee break on a number of occasions at this establishment We have always been greeted cheerfully and have enjoyed our coffee and scone It is a restful tea room and easily accessible from the A1 Alnwick Bypass We recommend The Old Stables for good quality produce and value for money 
positive, Great food loved it Mild to hot good variety The BBQ wings are the best I ever had repeated as my whole family loved it The interiors are exciting and comfortable The only issue was very long wait for the main I guess it was an exception I would have rated 5 if the food had come on time or someone bothered to come and tell us but I would rate their service as professional as they did all they could to make our visit very satisfactory will definitely visit again 
positive, A group of us went to pre theatre dinner It was very good and suited all of our different whims Guess you always need to book though if you are going to the theatre as we were 
positive, We had a late dinner here and it was lovely the owner was very friendly the food was great we found them helpful they were happy to chat with us and give us tips on where to go the food was clearly home made and delicious we would go back 
positive, Good coffee amazing deli panini topping up with good service I am giving only 4 stars as they should have a lunch time deal  Highly recommended 
positive, We decided to go out for Sunday lunch at the last minute The Crooked Billet was fully booked in the restaurant but they had space in bar where they seem to serve the full menu as well as a cut down bar menu The friendly staff made a point of covering a couple of menu choices that were not available but the menu is large enough for that not to be an issue My wife had the roast lamb and I had the beer battered fish Both done perfectly We will certainly go again The bar and outside table area is dog friendly 
positive, We visited this restaurant twice during our few days in Berwick We found the food and the service extremely good It is a relaxing restaurant with a good atmosphere and friendly host and is ideally situated within the town We couldnt fault the food we especially enjoyed the fillet steak 
positive,This is just a very well thought out and executed restaurant not quite Michelin starred but damn it - pretty close The location is a lovely part of Katherine s Dock which feels like you have been teleported out of busy London The restaurant itself is comfortable and welcoming The staff could not have been more engaging and pleasant but also professional and knowledgeable Then we get to the food which is tapas but nothing like the tapas I ve had before in Spain or in England This is a very inventive version of tapas - I m not a food writer - I cannot do the dishes we had justice - but hey go yourself and taste them you ll thank me - Would I recommend it I just did  
positive,Visited Sunday night with friends having stumbled across restaurant earlier in the day Great welcome - food fresh and tasty Thoroughly recommend eating here AND Vittorio not sure of correct spelling  has a lovely singing voice 
positive, I visited The Yard recently with friends  Atmosphere is nice for couples families and small group of friends having two dining areas inside and one outside  Food was delightfully presented and tasted as good as it looked I had a Burger which was fresh and very tasty the best I ve had for quite some time  Creative use of ingredients but at the same time very well balanced with complimentary flavours Friends had a sharer which they said was very good particularly the fresh spring rolls and pork Service was very good staff friendly as well as helpful and attentive too your needs not a long time for getting the order out even Have no hesitation in recommending this foodie place and Malton as a destination for good food 
positive, We visited Shabana recently whilst visiting family in the area and enjoyed a decent curry  We rang to book but needn t have bothered because it wasn t very busy even on a Saturday evening  We were seated and waited to get order our drinks and we waited and we waited Finally our drinks order were taken but dissapointment prevailed as there were only small bottles of cobra and only Kingfisher on draft - come on a curry isn t a curry without a giant bottle of Cobra or Kingfisher  Finally our drinks arrived but with one of our party having to wait  We then orderd our food and were pleasantly supriosed by the quality of the curry - they ve obviosly got a good chef  But we wanted another drink so ordered them but for some reason they didn t arrive so had to reorder - terrible  Overall the food was excellent but the service was terrible 
positive, Visited the Tempest on 1st June 16 Despite the resurfacing works going on in the car park which was full always a good sign  we managed to park on the side of the road The pub had a very friendly atmosphere and we had not booked but a table was available The menu is not extensive but wide enough for most tastes Prabably best to do a few dishes well than churn out masses of pinged rubbish We had a starter main course and sweet all of which were extremely tasty and very well presented and deelivered in ample portions The staff were very attentive and efficient I would recommend The Tempest to anyone who wants a good value and good quality meal 
positive, What a super place this is A huge fireplace and old-fashioned armchairs make it difficult to leave The menu is very interesting and varied I was spoiled for choice and would have been happy with at least 6 out of the approx 15 on offer The home-made Thai crab cakes were excellent though a sweet chilli side dip would have been a good idea No complaints though I shall look forward to a return visit 
positive,This is ideal for lunch it is years since I have eaten here in the evening I tend to come here to take advantage of the set lunch menu whilst at work The food is good if standard Thai fayre but is very reliable with good service and great value  As a regular visitor they must be doing something right I d recommend this place for anyone looking for reasonable tasty food served well and promptly if you gave an hour spare away from the office 
positive, Great meal food was tasty had burger with brisket meat very soft and tasty corn dog was lovely shake was nice but did not enjoy the donut just being picky the restaurant is a little cold now with winter coming needs to get sorted will be back 
positive, what s not to like Kim and Steve make you really welcome the food s good the wine s good good atmosphere 
positive,I ve been here four times now and each and every time the meat is done beyond perfection   you really won t get better anywhere  But  the salads   it s a lottery Now and again you get one so sour and tart that your face just puckers up and you can t think of anything else for the rest of the evening I know about tangy   but this is exponentially beyond tangy  I genuinely do recommend going but if you get a salad try it fast and get it changed if it makes your lips smack the back of your head 
positive, This is now a vast improvement on what it was in the past The decor is excellent and and it seems no expense has been spared on trying to make this the In Place in Harrogate The food was great and the staff were extremely attentive but that should be expected as it had been open less than a week The wine list is extensive but overall I felt that as a bistro it was expensive in excess of 220 for 4 people 2 of which were teenagers  including drinks for 2 courses Request a table behind the front screened area as I think the bar will become very popular and it will mean that you are eating amongst a throng of young drinkers at busy times Will certainly try it again though 
positive,Breakfast with a friend and like many others who have written reviews on Dishoom I was also sceptical about British Indian food Being an Indian myself this place seemed even less exciting but boy was I wrong Fresh dishes flavoursome and interesting flavour mixes topped off with reasonable prices and brilliant service It s really the small things that make the experience when dining out and from being seated immediately to being asked for water rather than the conventional can I have some water please i m dying of thirst from the Central Line to being given extra time to order breakfast because my friend had not arrived yet rather than the conventional breakfast finishes at X and you re Y so Z  No complications no fuss just excellent service and pleasant if not mindblowing food I look forward to my next visit and testing the curries On this occasion I speak for the breakfast menu and the delicious chai seemingly bottomless and give a great big thumbs up 
positive,Had a fantastic meal at this restaurant which was spicy NOT swimming in oil great friendly staff Could have done with some background music and to give a better entrance impression remove the clutter from the doorway as well as fix the strip in the floor - loose the duck tape - it really lets you down 
positive, Went with four friends looked at trip advisor beforehand and the reviews were positive  Everyone said how good the food was  the Dansak was as good as any I have eaten  also feed value 
positive, The starters are very good value with lots of choice For mains lots of fresh kebabs but if you like fish there is a choice of sea bass or sea bream grilled to order with fried potatoes and an extensive salad A great place for an inexpensive freshly cooked family outing Booking advised - restaurant was full by 19 30 on a Wednesday Would definitely have given an overall rating of 5 if waitress had not picked up a fork which had been knocked onto floor and put it back on adjacent table 
positive, We popped in here last weekend on a hot day so Caff was very busy We had a nice visit and ordered a couple of toasties there was a mix up with one being on the wrong bread but that doesn t bother us The milkshakes were brilliant the best part was that the woman managing the shop heard that we were looking for a longer parking space and offered us hers for the 3 hours we were in the area  this was brilliant and very lovely of her We will definitely be returning Many thanks 
positive, We visited The Bellhouse for lunch never been before but I believe it used to be a harvester  It has the feeling of a country pub in a built up area which is nice We sat outside on a day that wasn t particularly warm and was in fact raining This isn t an issue as they have huge heated umbrellas in their outside seating area  We went to the bar to order drinks first impressions are so important and the man behind the bar gave the impression we were an inconvenience to him We ordered drinks with one being a diet coke the drinks were placed on the bar without too much enthusiasm from the bar man but with no indication which was the diet coke so I had to ask Customer service in the UK sucks and spoils what can be great places  Our food was delivered promptly and tasted great but there was something missing and that again came back to the lack of interest from the staff If they could sort that out then I would go back again as the food is good 
positive, My wife and I went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch On offer was a all you can eat menu for 18 95 per person You could choose as much as you liked from a set menu Most of the food was very good it was just let down by a few things We has chicken satay spring rolls BBQ ribs and seaweed for starter and were all really nice The crispy duck was let down by dried out meat and too much crispy fat We had a variety of beef chicken and lamb dishes for main course - all pretty good Staff were friendly and attentive - I would definitely go back 
positive, We went to this restaurant with our 2 kids and parents for a simple Lunch We had the pleasure to appreciate some nice pub food We were served quickly and our kids had some specials from the kids menu We are grateful the chef was flexible enough to adapt to our kids wishes We also liked the decoration and the room we were in was very quiet which we enjoyed for a family meal 
positive, Booked last minute for our first night out during our stay in Torquay Kids had huge burgers with great chips and very hot  Wife had the Thai which was rated very highly Service was good Portions huge We had a good evening enjoyed our food and waddled away very full 
positive, Excellent high-end Indian cuisine not your typical high street fayre Had poppadums masala dosa and Alleppey Prawn Moilee from the dinner menu all excellent washed down with a bottle of Tucker and interspersed with some lovely amuse bouche including tomato & lentil soup and lychee ice cream  Superbly presented excellent service 
positive, Prezzo is one of the most reliable chains of Italians in the UK This was my first time at this branch and it didn t disappoint  We arrived at 13 15 and explained that we had tickets for Buckingham Palace and needed to eat lunch and walk back across Green Park for 14 45 The restaurant was very quiet but the staff were great ensuring we were able to complete our meal of two courses and coffee with plenty of time to make our entry time without ever feeling rushed Two pizzas and a chicken dish were all delicious and the service was friendly informative and efficient  The building has an interesting history having been a bar in the 1960s I would definitely go back again 
positive, My son and myself visited the Black Lake Inn on the Hilderstone Road Meir Heath Stoke on Trent There is a good choice of starters We both had garlic breaded mushrooms which cost 3 25 each Then for a main meal he chose a rare steak and commented that the chef truly knew how to cook rare steak His meal was Steak New York and cost 12 95 I had a meal called surf turf and cluck which consisted of 10z rump steak cooked medium scampi and chicken breast etc My meal came to 14 95 The meals were quite big and reasonable in cost The service was friendly and although the inn was very busy we did not seem to have wait long for our meals The place is well worth a visit 
positive,I am eating there once in a while the food is good service nice very cosy place They have a good menu lots to choose from It is always tasty something different 
positive, Visited early in the evening and chose the festive menu The steak was very good and the service was excellent Don t understand the reason for the very large lettuce wedge which was unnecessary but the meal and service made for a pleasant evening 
positive, Formally the Ruchetta Restaurant we returned to find a new name Ristorante Reno s and new management The food was excellent and the staff extremely friendly We have never seen this restaurant very busy but it desrves to be - well worthe the drive to visit it 
positive, This cafe is great It looks like a typical greasy spoon and in fact does have the typical egg bacon baked beans chips if that s your preference but as it s run by a real Italian family they also do lasagne for example and other Italian dishes and very nice home-baked pies  But if you just want a s=up of tea and a couple of slices of toast it s great for that also 
positive,Nice characterful pub food good dog friendly ample parking prices were a little steep but no worse than most pubs within the area I d recommend booking a minimum of 24hrs in advance as you get turned away when it s busy 
positive,I last visited this restaurant a year ago and thought the place expensive I have revisited and found a contrast to a year ago The menu is clearly redesigned showing more options and prices available though the wine is listed on the boards in chalk above your head and if you do not look you will miss the prices The meals from cheap to expensive depending on what you want to consume look at the menu for a cheaper variant if available Wines range with a decent taste to the palate both a good range of white red or rose wine available Food is freshly cooked so expect about 20 minutes so if alone - take a book or a kindle  I did and no objections raised  If there is a group going I recommend making reservations beforehand Without a drink a meal can cost less than 10
positive,It s a great afternoon out for my granddaughter and I to cycle over to Heath Tea Rooms and call in for some refreshments We always spend our time outside so I can t really comment fairly on the tables inside the premises Outside the gardens are extremely well presented the refreshments are really nice and being on Heath Common there is almost no noise An island of tranquility The staff are extremely helpful and always make sure my granddaughter is served what she wants 
positive, started visiting in 2013 but quality started to deteriorate so stopped in mid 2015 re-visited mid-august 2016 and pleased to say it seems to be back to it s best sunday menu sensibly limited to traditional dishes and it seems to work not cheap but bearing in mind quality and portions pretty good value good selection of wines and cask ales only negative is that they allow dogs in the main dining area 
positive, Excellent menu choice service and food was good but a bit more pricey than our local Chinese restaurant 
positive, I visited recently with my family for Sunday brunch we didn t book a table and found ourselves a bit lucky to get a table so I would definitely recommend booking where possible  The menu offered something different to your usual brunch spots which was refreshing and the quality of the food definitely backed up the quirky menu and buzzy atmosphere  One to try if you are looking for a bit of variety in your brunch routine 
positive,My wife and I ate at Postilion on a busy Saturday night and had pre booked We had a nice table near the window but the restaurant is split into 2 main rooms and my main advice if you pre book would be to make sure you don t get the table by the kitchen door  Food was excellent for starters my wife had satay beef and pork patties and I had 3 little pigs both excellent and for main course we both had steak which was cooked perfectly as asked 1 rare 1 medium  The deserts we had Banana and Toffee Cr€—me Brul€÷e and Crepe both excellent Service was good although one of the waiters reminded me of Manuel from Fawlty Towers  and prices reasonable  All in all very enjoyable and I would return but just be careful not to get the table by the kitchen 
positive,Visited hungry after a show The restaurant is friendly unfussy and easy  The choice of food is good the flavours and textures genuine and interesting  Very good value for money and fun to be sat next to the staff eating and chatting at the end of service  Just what we needed at the end of a long day 
positive,Early evening meal with my wife staff were very friendly and various items we ordered came with very little fuss and was good and tasteful 
positive,The food here is very good and the service is also nice I had a Lamb Bhuna which was cooked to perfection I will be coming again
positive,Whether I pop in for supper with my wife drop in to meet friends to catch up with news I am always made to feel welcome be it a quiet midweek early evening or bustling rush hour food serving period  I have met friends who manage a large number of eateries and joined them for supper in the Jolly Sailor and they have commented that the food and service was better than one would expect So comfortable have we been at the Jolly that my wife has requested we celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary there  Visit and take time to sit and watch the river it will revitalise you in all ways 
positive, The Kings Arms in Ninfield is a place to go for good value food  It is quite often packed out so go earlier or later than normal to get a table I have found the staff to be quite unfriendly at times but I would put this down to how very busy and stressed they get  On my last visit they had run out of cutlery the queue for the carvery was very long and our table hadn t been cleared  it was the last table in the place  However it is very inexpensive and a homely place  I will still return 
positive, Food great had the two course early bird menu both meat and vegetarian meals very impressive although not a huge vegetarian choice across the whole menu The table was however a little too close to the kitchen and till so a little noisy and squashed in Also a little cold I am guessing the atmosphere during lunchtime would be better to make the most of the conservatory 
positive,Nice Italian chain slightly more up market than Strada - more professional and personal service hence more expensive Had a very tasty seafood risotto will the wife had seafood linguini which she enjoyed Wine a trifle on the pricey side but not enough to put me off  Was fairly quiet  possibly due to location on our visit there are lots of tables and the place is well cared for so I presume it gets busier later in the evening 
positive, I have been using Livingstones for 15 years It is always my first choice for coffee and a light snack sandwiches cakes jacket potato etc all at very reasonable prices  In the morning they do a bacon roll and a coffee combo for a bargain price  What sets it apart is the calm atmosphere the friendly manner and the usually quick table service of the volunteers who are young and old alike  I say calm atmosphere but of course sometimes young children playing can make a bit of noise but we ve all been children haven t we  I understand that the profits are all put to good use in third world countries so all in all a good cause  Give it a try or at least pop your head in and see if it is for you - it s a few doors from the Arts Picture House - another excellent venue - why not pop your head in there as well they do more than fillums  
positive, We had a very tasty takeaway meal We choose on of the set menu options and we weren t disappointed  The food was delicious and the portion sizes we big enough to feed more than just the 2 of us  We would definitely recommend Lanna Thai 
positive, Don t expect cordon bleu but what you get is good pub grub served throughout the day seven days a week at a great price Dave is an excellent landlord and well backed up by Laura and likable young staff Easy to park in decent surroundings as well as an historical 400 year old building Well worth a visit - ignore the complaints of diesel 122 who probably would be better shopping at Tesco  
positive, James - I tend to always go for a Burger As always it was as i expect from a Whetherspoons Good Burger Kaya - I had a HUGE hotdog I put lots of Mayo and Ketchup on it I like that you get lots of sauces I would eat this again  Jen - I just went for a Ham Panini and Chips It was nice and filed a hole I would like to see a better select of Merlot from the bottle Not a fan of wine from a tap 
positive,We went here because of a family birthday It really was superb with everyone satisfied in the end The menu is slightly limited but that s what you d expect from a fish and chip restaurant I ordered the breaded plaice and it was some of the best fish that I have ever eaten The portion was huge and well worth the price that I paid for it However while I will admit that a sunday lunchtime is not the busiest the atmosphere was lacking and not many people were in there 
positive, nice afternoon tea very good brew fresh cakes charming service and at a reasonable price we will visit again 
positive, Sue and Alfredo are a lovely couple and have made sure that their cafe is perfectly located in the very centre of Bexhill town staffed by warm friendly waiters and chefs and serving delicious twists on English Central European and Iberian dishes Eating here is an education in how varied and fun the cuisine of our homelands should be while the owners are unpretentious and just jolly good fun Very much recommended for those seeking high quality and affordable food in a low key setting 
positive, Great service in a small but cosy little restaurant food was excellent and very reasonably priced as well as the wine being cheap and of good quality Would definitely recommend to anyone and will make sure to come here again 
positive, We went to this pub on a Wednesday evening for the first time and ordered Linguine from the bar service The food was actually well presented and was particularly tastie It came very quickly and we were able to finish the meal and carry on with our evening very quickly The bar is nicely historic and well decorated and the staff were pleasant enough 
positive, Pulled over for a lunch dogs outside only which is fine beautiful views lovely food Kept passing on the way to the beach glad we pulled over Worth a visit 
positive, Seems well run efficient and smart nice place for a group meeting 
positive, Other reviewers who like The India Club seem to have it right I have been going for several years and it is indeed unchanging including during a very recent visit I would add to all that positivity that it is above all a very civilised place it does one good to be amongst such staff and customers I have rated its food as v good though it is more enjoyable than outstanding I have rated it as good for business and it is but not if you want to show-off It just isn t that sort of a room 
positive, good value meal everyone reasonably happy  mixture of menu meals kids meals & carvery carvery was very well cooked although strange choices of vegetables would have liked to see some plain carrots Broccoli or cauliflower On the whole it was worth the stop on the way home and would probably use again 
positive, Made a last minute decision to visit this restaurant for a party of 5 they were very accommodation and found us a table at short notice  The level of service was first class and very attentive without being in your face plus more importantly every member of our group remarked on the quality of the food I can thoroughly recommend the Fresh Scallops & Prawns in a puff pastry which I should have asked as a a main dish but larger - superb flavours and texture Well done to the whole team who worked well together 
positive, My second visit to this lovely restaurant Nothing out of this world but a good menu and friendly efficient service Will certainly return 
positive, Great little place can see why it s busy Great food Good service awesome cocktails with a twist A must 
positive,We visited the swan over the August bank holiday for a drink after a night out at the theatre The place had a nice atmosphere friendly staff nice crowd Nice views over the Thames Definitely worth a visit if your looking for a mellow venue along the southbank
positive,this is one of three golf courses within a 15 minute drive from home  lucky me  and is well worth a visit unusually you can play either 9 or 18 holes and front or back 9 first it has something for all abilities with plenty to test your skill level there is plenty of parking and a well stocked golf and accessories shop the restaurant is excellent and caters for everything from a light snack to a full steak-dinner and the menu is varied 
positive, Very good restaurant with a good selection of food We had three course and all was very good high quality food My Wife is American and was very impressed with it Only down side with the restaurant is the layout and features of it It s a pub and sadly doesn t have the American diner feel or vibe to it But I am being picky Worth a go 
positive, Me & my wife called here for Sunday lunch  The staff were all very pleasant & helpful  The carvery was very good plenty of meat & good choice of vegetables  Good beer choice with two cask ales Timothy Taylor & Black Sheep  Luckily my wife was driving  Happy Days  
positive,After driving round to try and get a last minute Sunday lunch we tried this place and was not disappointed
positive, As part of a weekend celebration of a major anniversary we booked in a group of over twenty family and friends for Sunday Lunch The tables were located as promised giving easy access for the children in the party to the play area which they enjoyed We could all order a la carte which was not on offer at another place we had tried and the meals were all delivered incredibly quickly given how full the place was Not only that everyone in the group was well satisfied with the quality and quantity of the food We appreciated the friendly and efficient service from start to finish and heartily recommend for such a group booking 
positive, A spur of the moment meal out with my wife son and daughter in law what a lovely spur of the moment really enjoyed the food as did all of us 
positive, Came here for lunch on Saturday seemed popular as there was a few people already in and it turned out to be a good choice Food was decently prices and didn t take long to come out The dough was very fresh as I got both garlic bread and a pizza My girlfriend got lasagne which she also enjoyed Our only comment was that the staff didn t seem too happy I don t think we saw the girl crack a smile and she didn t say more than a few words The food would be worth returning for though 
positive, Girlfriend s friends visited from Ireland and a visit to Duck & Waffle was high on their list of things to do The staff can either be very welcoming or quite rude This time around they were polite The lift is an experience in itself and the venue is amazing Cocktails are on the upper end of what you d expect to pay and the range is brilliant Worth a trip just for the cocktails dinner requires a lot of notice to get a booking Bone marrow cosmopolitan was my favourite 
positive, Came here fort food as we were staying and working in the area Restaurant is very nice inside and roomy The service we had was great from an attentive waiter The food was excellent and well priced The free brandys at the end of the meal was also a nice touch 
positive, Although we had to wait rather a while for our food they did apologise and cancelled the cost of the starter in reparation We had Belly Pork Tuna and Fish&Chips - all very good and I thought the Tuna exceptional served with apricot & tomato salsa The Lemon Meringue pie was lovely and light and beautifully presented but I would have preferred a little more bite to the lemon 
positive, We have dined here a couple of times now it s perfect for couples date night or family treat Whether your going for lunch or dinner still dress better than casual It can be persevere as a tad snobby but that s not a bad thing The food was a little overprice I think they may be trying a little too hard to push fancy food with flowers for Ongar Road but none the less again why not aim high The bar round the corner could be a great setting for drinks but the same DJ is always in there playing the same songs I think they need to mix the entertainment in to draw in the younger crowd 
positive,Were asked on the phone when we booked if we had any particular likes and dislikes so I explained that we were vegetarian When we arrived we were given the vegetarian menu and given a choice of seats by the very nice lady behind the counter  Our first choice of wine was out of stock so the waitress asked us what we liked and went to ask somebody else for advice She managed to find a bottle of exactly what we wanted from the exact country and region Fantastic service  Overall the food was very good the service excellent and the wine fantastic Would definitely eat here again if we came back to Ludlow 
positive, A pleasant caf€÷ with an old and comfortable feel There are a number of shops also selling a range of unusual things Nice place to sit in the sun by the sea with a coffee 
positive, The food was amazing i have no complains at all All 5 meals were to a high standard We had a few cocktails which were very nice And i have had a few cocktails in my time A big thank you to matthew paige w and summer 
positive,We are here during a weekend the first thing to point out is that the car park is tiny - maybe enough to for 20 cars We arrive as a party of 5 adults and a 2 month old baby who breast feeds The staff were great and provided a friendly fast service  There is a nice atmosphere here with a bunch of humerus pictures dotted around I ve been told these are from local artists  The toilets were very clean and baby changing facilities are available  The menu is fairly uncluttered with just a handful of tasty sounding dishes We ordered a few sides to share there were all around 5 each and were all really tasty veg dishes I ordered a crab salad which again was very nice but the portion was on the small size especially since main dishes are around the 12- 18 price range My dads meal came out slightly later than ours maybe 5 minutes at most  even so the staff apologised at the slight delay and gave him a larger portion  Deserts were really good I never end ordered one myself but tried the chocolate mousse and also the apple tart The tart was for 2 people to share and id recommend it if your undecided on a desert The presentation was also top notch I ve included a picture of it 
positive, Visited Planet Buffet on the 28 7 77 for a meal as it was my birthday overall I ve given it a 4 star rating  This Chinese restaurant has been in Hereford for a while now it doesn t look much from the outside and it could do with a bit of a makeover both inside and out but very satisfactory The food was great couldn t fault it plenty to choose from all very fresh and tasty and you can go up as many times as you like  i went 3 times just for the mains  twice for dessert  the drinks in my opinion were reasonable strongbow 2 80 pint boddingtons 2 80 pint pint of coke 2 50 Thought they would be a lot more exspensive  I ll most definitely be visiting this restaurant again  Adult prices  11 50pp after 6pm  pretty sure kids eat free with 1 paying adult  was also given a 20 off voucher to use on our next visit of take away which is a bonus  
positive,Went to eat at the Spring inn for a family celebration and got a booth next to the window in the conservatory area Staff are great and they look after you well Choice of food is good and you can swap things around as well if you fancy something else Everyone enjoyed the food and the atmosphere is great All in all good food  good drink great time
positive,Excellent place to get a pub meal when staying at the Old Station in Petworth - only 5 minutes away Good beer and good pub food from a varied menu
positive, We were in Hull City Centre currently AKA the bombsite on Friday April 1st and gravitated towards Princes Dockside where the pavements unusually are NOT dug up I had heard that Cuckoos had closed and decided to try the replacement-Blue Water I should mention that I never liked Cuckoos- bland food and indifferent service  Was very encouraged to see an interesting menu- breakfasts light bites mains sandwiches cakes etc There was a good & varied selection of drinks as well We decided to have a light ish lunch and chose Moroccan meatballs with hummus and Halloumi with chilli Jam Both were delicious nicely presented and had really flavoursome sauces and attractive and tasty garnish We both enjoyed both dishes but felt that some bread-to soak up all the beautiful sauces-would have been perfect The staff were very friendly and comfortingly seemed to have an interest in & knowledge of the product We enjoyed it so much that our light lunch was embellished by a selection board of cakes the star of which was the nicest Victoria sponge I have tasted Two meals cakes and four drinks including a large glass of house white cost under 30  Was pleased to find somewhere nice-and different in the city centre 
positive, We were on a cruise break and so were in Southampton for the evening  We therefore wanted somewhere near the quay to eat  This is a cosy relatively small restaurant with some nice touches Home made delicacies add to the quality We had some nice cheese pastries  The fish tasted fresh and was well cooked and our desserts were lovely  Portions are small but you get quality not quantity and that was okay for us  Cocktails were a little overpriced and some of the supplements hard to justify but overall we enjoyed our visit and would go back 
positive, The breakfast here is awesome we have knick named it BBB  Big boy breakfast it really is great the fried bread is to die for 
positive, Went for a drink Sunday afternoon and returned for a meal Monday evening Fairly quiet both times but service was still excellent Ales wonderful and food definitely superior to most chains  Just above Pulteney Bridge nice location 
positive, Excellent place to enjoy Nandos Opportunity to eat both indoors and outside the restaurant Excellent customer service plenty of tills so the movement of customers is quick everything catered for Exactly what a Nandos should be 
positive, Went here for a meal to celebrate our sons graduation Visited on a Tuesday night Not particularly busy Bar orders felt slow Ordered two beers poured straight away and three cocktails The cocktails took some time to arrive I know they have to make them but still seemed slow to arrive we ve just come back from a week in Greece where cocktails ordered appeared within a couple of minutes  The upside was that they were nice once they arrived  I thought the beer Peroni was pricey at 5 a pint but then I guess that s South East prices for you Food was great Good selection and well cooked Would come here again 
positive, I ve just been back to Il Mascalzone having last been there some years back We were all very impressed with the food - good portions well-presented and really tasty There s a wide selection on the menu from pizza and pasta to full meat and fish dishes Service was good too the waitresses were all friendly and efficient Il Mascalzone is Italian through and through - there s even a TV on the wall showing Italian programmes For us the only downside was that the restaurant was extremely loud mostly because the place was packed but they re also playing thumping music in the background Which all made conversation pretty difficult without constantly having to shout It was a Saturday night so probably not so bad at other times Overall a really good Italian restaurant great food good prices and good service Recommended 
positive, We chose the wild boar and chorizo burger and a basic burger Both very tasty served with prepared coleslaw and triple fried chips All served by an attentive but not pushy waitress who also looked after the drinks The Fullers London Pride beer was the best I have had served at the correct temperature Cost about 25  Yes we could have found one of the very varied eating establishments along the Broadway but we wanted something with some character  which had some history Although the existing building was built in 1902 the Swan s name on this site goes back much earlier The restaurant is up a lovely heavy oak staircase on the first floor into a large but quiet room Here we enjoyed some tranquillity away from the bustle of the streets of London Don t be put off by the very noisy bar downstairs just go through after seeing the menu on display out on the pavement  The Swan is 1 minutes walk across the road from Hammersmith Station and 5 minutes from the Hammersmith Apollo where we went to see Renaud In fact we were able to see the artist s billboard outside the Apollo from our table at the Swan while we ate upstairs A good start to our evening show 
positive, A typical harvester where you get good value for money food The waiter was attentive but not over bearing good views over the harbour A pity that they had run out of one of the bottle beer choices 
positive, Does what it says on the tin  Fast fresh fish &chips To make this review 100characters is nuts parking outside is difficult because of the popularity of the fish quay area itself 
positive,Went with friends and our dog Had a great meal good value for money very welcoming staff and the dog was also very welcome Nice atmosphere good food what more could you want 
positive,Went there with family The food was very good i recommend the roasted duck the crispy duck Waiters were attentive and kind I strongly recommend Price are adapted to the quality of the food 
positive, Me and my girlfriend ended there almost by accident looking for a place to have a late dinner at the Albert Dock We got surprised because of the joyful ambient that combined groups of people having drinks or other still having their meals The both of us ordered fish&chips and we got quite satisfied with the quality of the dishes and the service giving the fact that the prices were not exensives at all Quite advisable 
positive, Went with a huge group of friends for an early Christmas dinner and one of the waiters by the name of Connor was really really friendly Made the extra effort to check that everything was in place and was up to par Even gave us free champagne towards the end of the night Great service 
positive, Visited here yesterday during work childminding  It was a nice break for the children and they enjoyed their milkshakes and caramel doughnuts Loose tea was lovely and got plenty out of it Contrary to previous reviews on this experience the tables were clean and the service was good and prompt Will definitely be revisiting 
positive, Don t let the location put you off this place is great It s got a really original menu and the food is prepared to high standard Definitely one for curry lovers 
positive, I have always been a fan of the Fairman Being a Weatherspoon s you know what you re going to get Beer selection is great and the pumps are always clean My only comment is that the place is long overdue a refurb Lights half hanging off the wall grotty dirty paintings on the wall and different colour temperature lights on the exterior aren t giving the place a good image If anyone from Weatherspoon s sees this Please put some money into the building 
positive, Great little bar Good location on main street with a few seats outside Good atmosphere good service good drinks selection 
positive, Choice of 4 ales the 2 tried were both well kept and enjoyable Nice pub feel the sort of place where you could feel at home over a couple of pints and not feel that you were expected to order food 
positive, The Pub was a nice place to end a good day of sightseeing The food was good value for money & did not have to wait long for the food to arrive A nice way to unwind after a busy day 
positive,Took a while to get a seat but once that was done and the food ordered then it was very efficiently delivered Steak was cooked how I asked so no complaints there On busy days you can feel a bit rushed to finish your meal as people stand there looking at you with that hurry up an eat look on their faces 
positive,Hard to argue here friendly staff good food and really good value  7 per dish  Nice atmosphere would definitely recommend
positive,Friendly service comfortable nice decorative order recently decorated and very clean loos Excellent Lamb Hotpot and Robinsons Ales 
positive, I visited this pub with friends on a rainy Monday evening We had booked a table for 8 00pm having failed to get a 7 30pm booking because the restaurant was full We arrived 15 minutes early thinking we could enjoy a drink at the bar before getting our table but that proved more difficult than expected because there was nowhere to sit or even stand  We huddled in front of the bar getting in everyone s way and hoping we didn t have to wait too long Perhaps they could reserve a little space somewhere for diners awaiting their table  Got to the table and was immediately presented with the menu The waitress did not ask if we would like a drink and abandoned us to read our menus A good selection of dishes at reasonable prices Our party of four all content that they had found something to their taste Orders were taken including drinks and we were served about 20 minutes from the time we sat down at the table Reasonable for food preparation but 20 minutes without a drink is just too long  Food was of good quality well cooked and presented As the meal progressed and early diners began to leave the service at our table improved markedly  A little disappointed to begin but my opinions lifted as the evening progressed We left in good spirits having enjoyed pleasant evening 
positive, We selected the tasting menu option without the wine option and then couldn t agree which of the delightful dishes we enjoyed the most I went for the cod two others the pork and one the pre-dessert I did select a nice white wine from the massive list to accompany the meal and lots of fizzy water with coffee extra afterwards Service was excellent though it would have been better if the first two courses had arrived sooner as we indulged on the bread very nice though it was  The room did get a tad noisy as the evening wore on 
positive, This is the third time we have visited the White Lyon The food is absolutely excellent Some of the best Thai food we have tasted The staff are in the main very good The atmospere is also very friendly and welcoming  However the level of service drops dramatically when the place starts to fill up We will keep coming back as the food is that good But that service needs addressing That aside the place is excellent 
positive, Worth a visit to enjoy your fish and chips crisply fresh You will see a large queue in the shop for takeaway always a good sign The menu is varied and reasonably priced service is quick and friendly 
positive, Being lovers of Thai food we recently visited the Siam Smile in Cheltenham We were there on a Monday night so it was very quiet and were served quite quickly  The food was good but not the best we have ever had I felt that some of the flavours spices were just tempered back a little although it did clearly state on the menu how hot some of the dishes were  I think newbies to Thai food would not be disappointed but having been to Thailand and been to a lot of Thai restaurants in the UK I felt it was not quite up there with the very best  Overall though we did enjoy the evening and it is very popular as a takeaway option 
positive, been there before a few years back then called the Balnoon Inn what a improvement the new owners have made a comfortable clean restuarant serving delicous meals at a reasonable price certainly will visit next year on my next holiday 
positive, The food here was very good and the portions good value for money enjoyed the battered cod and chips 
positive, Every time we come back to Brighton we make the trip to Hove Park Cafe in it s idyllic Hove Park location  The coffee and the food are great whether you re really hungry or just want a snack Also the staff are really cool and the atmosphere is very chilled and laid back perfect for a late brunch 
positive, Got lost one sunday afternoon and came across this place so popped in for a drink with my partner just to check the place out my first impression as i walked through the door i noticed a big open fireplace with a log burner that was actually on and made the entire place feel cosy and a welcoming heat from the early chill upon ordering a drink and having a sneak at the menu which had a good range of different things to choose from we settled at a table and decided to have some pitta taramosalata and some greek sausages   great flavors  I had a stifado for main which was full of flavour and melt in the mouth tender and my wife had a mousaka which was equally tasty portions good for the price would definately go back and worth the drive in my opinion and to top it all the waiter told us about their traditional greek nights at the end of the month which ive not experienced before but will be trying to book for  i would recommend a trip to this restaurant to see for yourselves  
positive, I ate at The Basement with 3 friends and we had a very good meal  The menu has a variety of dishes and styles and the food is a good price Situated right by the Harbour and with outside dining in a heated marque conservatory it is a very pleasant spot to dine in an evening  All in all good value good food and a nice location 
positive,Very good food Manager is very keen to help if you wish to try new dishes and keen that you should wish to return At the end of the meal you get a box of chocolates if your party is minimum of four persons  Sometimes a bit over attentive but not enough to put you off Have visited several times and will certainly continue 
positive, A friend from Yorkshire recommended this pub for its Carvery Good quality and value for money It was because we had just re-located into the area She was absolutely correct which is a good job as we were taking our family and it could have been embarrassing It most certainly was not  
positive, My guest was in London on business for the day and needed to catch a train back north just before 20 00 so we chose this place for a convenient early dinner  Both the food and the service were very good Given the location I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and value for money The staff were attentive but not overly so They were also efficient which is a plus when you have one eye on the clock because there is a train to catch The place was perhaps half full  My guest was on a gluten-free diet one of the reasons for choosing an Indian restaurant as most Indian staples lack gluten but he needed to ask one or two questions which the waiter could answer with ease and confidence which was impressive  Well advised my guest plugged for one of the specials a lamb dish served inside a pumpkin skin He said it was very good I had a crazy craving for a mixed biryani and was very pleased with mine Not quite the dizzy heights of biryani in the finest restaurants in Hyderabad but very good indeed for a Thursday evening curry in Kings Cross My portion was huge so the fact that I left a fair bit behind was down to portion size not the quality of the food The vegetable curry on the side was a little bland on its own but made a good gravy for the biryani  In short as I said in the title very good for its price and location I ll certainly return here if when in similar circumstances again 
positive, The food here is sumptuous and the groceries for sale abound A very welcome stopping place at the edge of a very busy road Not to mention being able to visit the farm animals 
positive, Easily booked using their web site Our table was ready when we arrived A good warm welcome by staff  We were served quickly and the food was excellent A little pricey but on the whole good value 
positive, Visited here on Saturday night as part of a group of 7 and was a little concerned that it wasn t very busy and some of the tepid reviews here on TA  I have to admit that those initial fears were unfounded Yes it s not part of an antiseptic chain somewhere pretending to be something it s not and the beamed rooms only add to the charm in my opinion The orders were patiently taken whilst everyone tried to decide and change their minds halfway through because of all the choice When the food arrived it was lovely  You only had to look at all the empty plates for verification of that fact  One slight point to raise - and appreciate some people like to be in and out quickly - was that we felt the mains followed the starters quite quickly But it s not a major criticism - just a personal preference  We were made to feel very welcome by all the staff and was a great evening enjoyed by all We shall certainly be returning to sample some of the other dishes we missed out on on this occasion  Thanks again and see you soon 
positive,Lovely food by the beach with a lovely beer garden area Great value with big portions Great selection of St Austell Ales 
positive, My wife and I visited Betty s on Saturday 30th August A small queue outside - should have booked Didn t have to wait more than half an hour though Opted for two pink champagne afternoon teas OK not the cheapest maybe but what we had was very nice and very pleasant service from the waitress Heartily recommened 
positive, We stopped rather late on the way back from the midlands at about 2 pm Lovely big smiley welcome and Of course your are not too late It was very gastro Pub in design and yet it works Menu was good Service was excellent and it felt like we had visited many times before We sat in the bar not the restaurant and if I lived down the road it would make for a very good local  No stress just relaxed competency  We left refreshed and calm  
positive, Very nice Spanish restaurant on Queen Street in Clarendon Park just off Victoria Park Food is excellent and so is the wine list Inexpensive Staff is courteous and helpful 
positive,r u readi 2 pimp out if so go here like srs man u ever see that film soul plane ye well this is basically that in dessert form well gd init bit sickly tho nar mean
positive,Popped in for lunch and really enjoyed it We had the sampler platter some soups and a trout salad All the dishes were very good and we found that place very relaxed They had a 2 4 1 on Pinnacle which we took full advantage of   a couple of times - 
positive, Efficient friendly service Delicious pizzas washed down with a cold Peroni Rossa Would recommend  nice atmosphere 
positive, Birthday gathering of 14 family members and food service and bar all excellent Great joice of cocktails available menu is really wide and covers all tastes and the food was amazing It all arrived at the same time even though most people had chosen differntly The house red and white are really good value and the heated seating area outside is a real plus even in mid January Well worth a visit      
positive, Thursday Night is Steak Night at the Bell Inn The standard of the meat was superb and presented in the best Pub food manner Steak Chips Very Nice Too and Salad Very Nicely dressed If you can eat it all I would be amazed Even the Cheese Board was enough for two to share with some very good cheese This local Pub has got themselves someone very good in their kitchen And they have a good selection of Real Ale     
positive, You will need to look for this one but the greenhouse glass cover eating is fab Add the food drink music and good service well what else is there Well done you folks 
positive, Good fresh food fast service have eaten here three times and always had a positive experience A suprisingly large and elegant dining room also Very good value for the location 
positive,Went here early Saturday evening for a few beers and pizzas had a surprise with the green pizza though it s a big salad on a pizza base Note to self read the menu more carefully the others were truly delicious though and great beer choices too Enjoyed it 
positive, First timers and absolutely loved it Great food brilliant atmosphere and a mouth watering selection of cakes for desert Very reasonably priced with generous portion sizes We will be visiting again soon 
positive,Offering a wide choice of reasonably priced dishes this restaurant decoratively created from an old riverside warehouse is attractive for its ambience good food and especially the very genuine welcome and help of the staff We can testify for the litre flagon of house red which seems to go well with every dish The unique temperate climate of this corner of England gives a summer from May to end of October so the attractive terrace is well-used We recommend it to visiting yachtties who agree with us that it is not a place to eat in hallowed silence for it resounds to a shared happiness which is very Italian 
positive, If you are in Brixham on business or working and need a good cup of coffee and something to eat then head for this cafe where Dan and his team will serve you excellent coffee with a smile 
positive, First off the food was absolutely sublime I went for the quail starter and my girlfriend had the crab For the most part whilst eating our starters both of us looked like we had been recently lobotomised and hardly shared a word This was because the flavours bursting out of each mouthful were so complex and delicious a certain amount of concentration was required to make sure none of them got away - the citrusy sauce in amongst the traditional earthy quail ingredients was a thing of beauty The veal main also delivered on flavour as did the desert However upon our arrival at 14 30 for lunch our booked time we were told by the maitre d that the kitchen closes at two thirty  I was not sure what to say Were we too late to order Was I supposed to order within four seconds of sitting down Were the kitchen staff all about to leave I m sure the comment was not meant as such but it made us feel like we had to rush our meal and really did have an affect on our enjoyment Guys - if you are going to take bookings at half two then please make diners feel just as welcome for showing up for a later lunch as you would for those who book early A throwaway comment when you have been looking forward to something so special for so long really can affect how a diner views your place 
positive, Not the first time we ve dined there but have always found the carvery to be very good Food is always freshly topped up and the meat is carved when you say what you want Serving chef was very happy but couldn t say the same about all the pub staff but then someone has to work on a Sunday Overall the food is excellent and well worth what you pay 
positive, We stayed nearby & found The Red Lion on our first night in Alnmouth Sunday when they mainly serve a Sunday Lunch type menu We had a table in the Restaurant as it is more comfortable after we had had a drink or two first in the Bar Very pleasant evening we had too nice starters & good main course good food decent value nice pub & friendly staff Even though they only serve to early evening people were still welcomed close to the advertised closing time without issue 
positive, Bistrot Pierre has a nice feel and atmosphere The staff are friendly and quite attentive Had a lovely evening apart from a couple of things though - my main course the Burger Maison and frites were pretty much cold I didn t want to hold up the rest of our group and I was hungry so I did eat it and to be honest it still tasted all right I did mention it to the waiter and he apologised but reading other reviews it does seem to be a problem Also my daughter ordered a Traditionelle Tarte Flamb€÷e which is definitely on the menu as coming with salad or pomme frites and when it didn t the waiter told us he d checked with the kitchen who dismissed it and said it didn t come with them Hopefully these issues can be addressed as I think the restaurant could be just what Altrincham needs and it would be a shame if it didn t get the repeat custom 
positive, We came here for lunch  party of 4 Parents and girlfriend  The starter was great And the service was good everything was going so well Until I decided to order the sea bream after expecting a fillet I was served with a fish The whole fish I was a Virgin in these regards  This was a poor decision I had never gouged the eyeballs of a fish before  nor had I removed bones  This went horribly for me I ended up taking and hour and a half to finish whilst having a bone lodged in my throat Great life lesson for me  All in all a horrible experience all down to my own decisions  9 10 would go again  
positive, I had their 2 courses set The starter was the mush of chicken liver and it was really nice I then had some diced beef It was nice and it tasted as the real-homemade food I really have to mention the vegetable mush It was amazing and tasty After all this place is of great value of your money 
positive, Just looking for a quick meal prior to going to the theatre - food was tasty and a good varied menu  Decent food  good service  and not overly expensive by London standards 
positive, My wife and sons wanted lunch so we decided to try the mustard pot and we were pleasantly surprised The fish and chips were fresh and tasty and the pie was meaty and obviously home made all at a reasonable price the decor is very much in the tradition of the English village Inn warm and inviting and the most important item the beer is very much the traditional ale wih a few imported beers to choose from The staff were attentive and friendly without being annoying and the charming landlady was on hand to ensure no one was ignored and every detail was attended to An altogether pleasant experience 
positive,My wife and I visited last night and was very pleased Good food  nice surroundings and great service Pub recently changed hands and looks like they are getting it right Well done 
positive, Nice atmosphere good service good food good price VERY friendly There is little more to be said about this pleasant Italian restaurant I WILL be returning and on a fairly regular basis 
positive, Casual eating for the seriously rich inhabitants around Marylebone High Street Gives a very good feel for this neighbourhood which has actually been very cool since Paul McCartney stayed here with Jane Asher and family back in the Sixties 
positive, We booked online - simply enough Arrived and were directed to our table but requested if we could have drinks on the balcony Drinks arrived promptly while we viewed the menu When ready we went in to our table and ordered Starters arrived in good time and were all very good Mains also arrived promptly and were delicious All followed by desert and coffee No complaints about food - all very good - in fact number one son said best burger he had had  Only comments would be - drinks a bit pricey but not unusually so - deserts also a bit expensive for their size but again his is not unusual in restaurants these days At no point in the evening was the place full - despite the sign downstairs saying fully booked - however I would rather they were half full and delivered a good experience than packed to the rafters and under delivered On the whole a good evening From a group that regularly eat out in Brixham 
positive,I attended with friends on a late Sunday morning for some breakfast lunch  The service was very friendly the building is nicely decorated with an industrial feel to the architecture and some interesting ornaments and oddieites on display  The important bit though the food While the menu is fairly limited compared to some places that offer every dish under the sun there was a good range of traditional breakfast meals and should have something to appeal to all tastes The food arrived quickly and tasted good I opted for a sandwich and soup while friends had full English breakfasts and the accompanying smoothie was lovely  All in all I liked it here Given it s over 100 miles from home I m unlikely to return anytime soon but if I lived in Derby I d be sure to visit again 
positive, If you are looking something to round off an evening in the either of the fabulous real ale establishments of the Devonshire Arms or the Coopers Tavern you should definitely try Apne Despite the place being full with a very large party we were very quickly seated and service was prompt throughout the evening As well as the usual suspects on the menu it is worth considering something from the speciality menu I chose one of these which was a chicken tikka curry surrounded by Bombay potatoes and pilau rice  Although there is no licence soft drinks are available but you can also take a pint from your chosen tavern - 
positive, I think that the experience you have of the Red Lion is going to be dictated to a significant degree by where your table is located My table for two was trapped between a large table seating about ten and a partition Space was rather tight but the bigger problem was that we just could not hear each other at times and I am not saying that the larger table beside us was being particularly loud - it was just the acoustics of the location Service was a bit slow at the time I ordered a glass of wine just before the food was served and then had to eat really slowly so as not to have finished the meal by the time the wine arrived Despite all of this I am still giving a four out of five on the strength of the food itself I will definitely go back but will try to find a quieter time or go in a bigger party to avoid being the shoe-horned in table for two 
positive, Good value restaurant the set price buffet is excellent  situated in the pleasant High Street of Stevanage Old Town 
positive, Happened upon this place while wandering around Rye - glad we found it Very stylish decor and presentation of food and service was excellent Good selection of beers  5 for kids meal including drink and ice cream Mac N cheese was apparently even better than Dad makes quite an accomplishment for any restaurant Milkshakes were also delicious and we didn t try them but they also had freakshakes on the menu I had the sliders and they were good but a touch dry With a smothering of burger sauce and perhaps leaving the burgers a little pink in the centre this would have been a 5 rating All in all a great lunch 
positive, Always been very good when we go here we go back so that says it all  service is always good too and the food is always quick love it 
positive, Good food well cooked and served Nice ambiance and good views from the windows We went on Saturday lunchtime the place was busy but the food still came quickly The Bakewell puddings are a must 
positive, As some friends and I are meting up for an evening out next month I said I would investigate Jamie s as a potential venue I was shown to a table in the window area great view of St Martins but also the less impressive construction work The friendly waitress arrived within 2 minutes of my sitting down and asked if I wanted to hear about the daily specials I d already decided what I wanted from the main menu but later heard her give the details to other diners and was impressed with her detailed knowledge of each of the dishes she was describing My food was absolutely fine a starter of mushroom bruschetta main course of roast scallops and posh chips and finish with an extremely rich chocolate and espresso tart These were all well cooked the chips are absolutely perfect  My only slight reservation was the layer of rock salt that the scallop shells sit in to prevent them sliding over the plate A good idea unless you also have the fennel and lemon salad on the same plate Inevitable result is that the salad leaves were rather over-salted I think that one needs a re-think Drinks of a glass of prosecco and a decent sauvignon blanc plus a very decent macciato gave me a bill of 41 Not cheap but certainly reasonable value for the quality of ingredients and the skill in the cooking and mostly presentation I was dining quite early so the place was not even close to full but there was a friendly buzz of conversations from the other diners Decor was ok reminded me of The Gourmet Burger Company in Brindley Place I ve given my thoughts to my friends and we are definately going there in April Its not the best restaurant in Brum but then its not pretending to be What it is is good food drink and atmosphere tied together in a not-too-expensive bundle Well worth a visit 
positive,we popped in for lunch on a Saturday Cous Cous dishes were lovely Tender lamb chicken and mezze were delicious Friendly service and good location for the shops and Marleybone station 
positive, This is local to me so I go about once a month The coffee is always good and I think the flat white is my favourite The staff are friendly but t he food is only so-so The best thing I think is to stick to the coffee and cake Last time I wen with the family it took a long time to feed a table of six It works better for couples 
positive, had a nice mixed grill wife had cheese and tom toastie your average but decent food for weatherspoons beer as always excellent breakfast next morning though served on luke warm plates unususl for ws as they are usually piping hot but would still recommend as this place was fairly quiet nnd comfy 
positive, Great food and excellent service all round lovely decor and nice to see one of englands oldest pub preserved in such a good manor 
positive, I have been here last week the place is very clean I had ALCATRA which was very good tasty service was excellent i will be back 
positive, Excellent high quality food good service and a reasonable bill The Inn was very busy when we eat there but this did not affect what ended up as a most enjoyable evening 
positive,Having previously eaten at the Gatwick Airport branch my girlfriend and I decided to drop in here for an evening meal when we were in the area I feel the main draws of Giraffe is the varied menu which gives a good range of dishes across some different styles of cuisine Asian and Mexican influenced dishes seem to predominate but there is also a range of more traditional burger and grill items I was impressed with my food I feel something Giraffe do well is thinking of little twists to add to the character of the dish toasted seeds on top of my burrito rather than just smothering it in cheap cheese like you might see elsewhere  We also had a cocktail each which proved to be tasty but a little  weak  for my tastes Overall atmosphere was nice and pleasant and the service was about friendly I think the 12 5 service charge added is a little over the top for two waitresses covering most of the tables Lastly and I think this is quite rare for a chain restaurant I left feeling that there was plenty left on the menu worth returning for  I d like to try their brunches some time as they look super tasty 
positive,Very good value for money in a nice quiet area outside Derby City Centre My stays are usually for just a few nights for business reasons A friendly relaxed environment with good food and beers Breakfast is always excellent served by Ann who is always courteous happy and smiling 
positive, Excellent food and soup well served hot and generous Staff engaging and helpful but why do they have to close @ 5pm sharp when the Dockyard doesn t close until 6pm Coffees really strong and tasty 
positive, Booked Real Greek in St Martins Lane for a pre theatre meal Service was all one could wish for fast pleasant helpful smiling Food was good tasty what it said on the tin And yes the chips ARE light fluffy and delicious as the menu promises Salt cod great Chicken skewers a general favourite Thin site and quite small so imagine could get crowded Jolly and friendly heart if West End rather than place for a romantic date or business meet 
positive, we attended for a family meal and was pleasantly surprised the venue is very nicely decorated and feels warm and friendly tables were spotless and clean and staff very friendly we went to order food at bar and within 20 minutes it was on our table piping hot and a plate full and really tasty some great offers on throughout the week including kids eat for a 1 on Monday 
positive, On entering this old building one has the impression of an old public house but there is upper floor dining in a non pretentious room which has seen better times and is in need of redecoration However in our experience the menu provides flavoursome food presented well and served by efficient staff who are keen to please 
positive,I was adamant I wouldn t return after 2 previous visits 1st visit I waited 25 minutes for a single espresso with only 2 other tables present 2nd visit the calamari were rubber However on my most recent visit Alex our waiter was a breath of fresh air Very attentive & helpful he assured me that the calamari would be delicious this time around He was spot on The mains lacked flavor & style however the service somehow made this irrelevant Overall a good visit 
positive,Finished work in town and fancied a pizza so had a wander after seeing the disgusting looking take aways hanging about it wandered a little further  Stumbled across a nice looking place down a side street and after asking a for a few sugestions on pizza and seeing some nice looking bottles behind the bar decided to ask for my pizza on a plate and settled for a nice bottle of vino may have to start an after work tradition Big love to MAMMA M 
positive, My son and I ventured in for an evening meal and were welcomed and lead to a table in a reasonably quiet dining room Service was prompt polite and friendly The menu was reasonably priced and with a number of familiar Mexican dishes plus some specials that we decided to venture into My son was a little hesitant at ordering the Shark but was frankly surprised and pleased with the dish 
positive, We enjoyed a first class Christmas dinner last December the turkey dinner was the best ever we have dined at some expensive restaurants and they did not come near Yes we have booked up for this December 
positive, Child friendly with safe enclosed garden good food and drink with guest ales polite and friendly staff 
positive, Very much enjoyed a Sunday Lunch meeting up with relations I had not seen for many a long year As I had spent many years in and around Sarratt in my youth and indeed enjoyed a number of visits to the Boot 50 + years ago I was really pleased to find that the Pub has still retained much of its old character The food was all of a very high quality and served professionally even though it was a busy Sunday Really liked the fact that we were not rushed and spent a very enjoyable afternoon reminiscing while the rain bucketed down Would love to come back again 
positive, We have been to the Pheasant on a number of occasions and the food is always on top form Great menu well presented and delicious Cant fault the chef or the local produce 
positive, On impulse trip out to nearby pub for lunch Never eaten there before Decent menu Decent service Generous portions Reasonable prices Not gourmet food and not five star but certainly good value We will return and we recommend it 
positive,Good food reasonably good service good atmosphere although the restaurant is a bit noisy due to the height of the ceiling 
positive, Visited The Plough on a busy Saturday lunchtime with my dad aunt and grandma and was very impressed with the decor service and most importantly the food Both my grandma and aunt can be quite conservative with food but both were really happy with their fish and chips and crayfish cocktail which was supposedly a light bite but was huge and plenty for a main dish  My burger was good but could of been a little bigger and rarer but this is me being ultra critical Pizza looked really good and everything was presented really well  Their ale was well looked after and think overall it is pretty good value Will definitely be returning for their BOGOF pizza night on a Monday 
positive, My wife and I arrived at Covent Gardens on our way to the theatre We had decided to go early and look for a restaurant Luckly we found Cantina Laredo just a short walk from the tube station We like Mexican Food but we have not found many realy good one in London Well The staff were welcoming the service was efficient and attentive the menu was not overwelming but there was a good selection of most traditional Mexican dishes The food was excellent and the drinks were as well A Lucky find 
positive, This was our second visit to the Plough We went on a Saturday evening and the pub was only moderately busy The lamb and steak were excellent and the portions were of a good size The service was fast and efficient Definitely worth a visit 
positive, We spent a night here and were pleasantly surprised by size of room and quality of ensure - particularly when you consider this cost a third of the price of our previous night in bath A word of warning - they have a guest singer guitarist on first Friday of month when we were there and he was very good and we enjoyed the night but just don t expect much quiet before midnight We also ate there but this was not quite such a good experience - lets just say the menu read better than it ate and the execution of the cooking was very imprecise We did complain and got a reduction in bill without a quibble but would sooner have had it right in the first place 
positive, First time I visited on my first trip into Surrey and this is a nice pub restaurant not far from my hotel and near Box Hill too  It s a busy place but relaxing in a modern decor I enjoyed a lovely full Rioja wine my food was very good and the lamb rib starters were lovely and moreish I had venison which was ok maybe not the best I ve had anywhere but very tasty food at the end of a busy day and the spinach I ordered as well was excellent  This is a good place for a stopover meal out and its popularity is no doubt deserved I m glad I found it Many thanks to the staff   
positive, We have been to this Nandos a number of times and the food is always great and the service is very good Be aware that it can be very busy so be prepared to wait for a table but it s always worth it 
positive, The food is of a reasonable quality as is the service  However the menu is more than tempting there is something for everyone s taste The Kitchen will go out of it s way too meet ones culinary requirements and without extra cost or fuss They are far better at catering for large numbers and they excel at wedding receptions 
positive, Have been to Harland Place a few times now and couldn t agree less with the majority of the reviews The food has always been delicious staff very friendly and food and drinks served quickly It is a fairly new place in Norton so I think given time could also get even better Also a great spot to meet for a few glasses of wine and a complimentary bowl of olives of a Saturday night Great place for couples familys friends 
positive, Lots of different ice cream flavours Not cheap and portion sizes can vary but ice cream is very tasty Good layout of tables with lots of space but the floor was filled with tissues etc so was a little dirty Had to get a cloth to clean our table but with lots of ice cream i guess you can expect the tables to be sticky I prefer to take out when visiting or sit outside on the street 
positive,Always a reliable bet for a family treat The children always get want they want Never too much trouble for the staff The pizza that Daisy had was great Pudding - to much choice - no chance we all love it 
positive,Coastline looks lovely inside since they redecorated It can be very busy at peak times and service can slow down I can t fault the food and the icecream a are delicious Los of outside seating I regularly stop there for a snack after walking the dog and we sit outside 
positive,Had a lovely dinner yesterday evening in Jenkins and sons with a local friend where I noted the service is remarkably inproved The Sea bass was excellent as was my fancy Burger The young waitress was very friendly extremely knowledgable on both the menu items and the wine list and provided very fast and efficient service The outdoor street tables were all full as diners enjoyed the warm evening sunshine 
positive, I came to the ruby with wife Augustine my son and daughter we had a lovely meal with lots and lots of food  The food quality was great and the spinning table was amazing for sending items to the other family members Overall meal I cannot fault only downfall was the price of drinks the bill came to 20 for 4 cokes  Would rate to friends lovely family meal 
positive, Had a beautiful meal last night as a group of us celebrated my friend s 60th birthday All the meals were excellent and the service was very good with attention to detail  Obviously this is run by a new owner who is finding his feet  but I could not fault his work so far  I particularly liked the chicken in the sauce with English mustard Excellent  I would not criticise anything at all Very good and I would recommend it 
positive, Excellent service from very attentive staff We all had steak which was cooked perfectly and just as we had asked 
positive, Great atmosphere with some hustle bustle and a general feeling of everyone having a good time  Had heard the food was suspect but we found our food absolutely delicious tasty and well cooked No complaints at all Spicy Yes but that was expected and indeed required Sauces Hot Spicy Yep you bet Fantastic experience  Service was good and attentive even though we were there at a busy time Didn t feel rushed and left to chat and people watch -as you do Would heartily recommend 
positive, Visited here for lunch a few weeks ago and it was lovely I ordered a club sandwich which was massive with a side of sweet potato fries my other half had some type of pulled pork type sandwich again with sweet potato fries and we both thoroughly enjoyed it 
positive, Good lasagne Good hunter s chicken Very helpful service Nice family pub Good guest ales 3 5 stars on food hygiene but no problems we could see 
positive, After the disappointment of not being able to get into the Crab House due to them not be efficient enough to serve the number of tables they have It was half empty and said they couldn t serve us within 30miles and then they would shut Anyhow   We decided to find somewhere else Ignoring the unhelpful waitresses suggestion we looked up local pubs and found this one  What a great choice Staff are super friendly and helpful Food was of a high standard the kids were made to feel at home even got their own table  I had beef and ale pie which was fantastic my partner had scampi which I stole one or two off her plate  Crispy and succulent The kids servings were substantial and well cooked  Plenty of choice for drinks too Rae had Raspberry and Nettle a great choice  Price was very reasonable 2 adult meals 2 kids and 6 drinks 40 
positive, Popped in on the way home for an early evening meal Plenty of choice on the menu including the specials all perfectly cooked and served hot the staff are very welcoming and helpful  Finally being a 2 for 1 gastro-pub the value for money really hits the spot 2 mains 2 desserts and a couple of drinks for 25 bang on  
positive, Lovely location located in the pretty village of Huggate on the Wolds Way Very traditional Yorkshire pub landlord can give the impression of being a bit cool and wasn t too chatty when I tried to start up a conversation but nothing to worry about  Would have been nice to see a real fire in the main bar instead of a wood burner that was hard to see inside as glass was very dirty But the food was great and loved the famous steak pie which was amazing and very filling  Will return again soon 
positive, Dropped in on spec Sunday lunch time ordered from the extensive vegetarian section of the menu spoiled for choice  Two halloumi stacks portion of chips aioli horseradish and roast garlic mayo later washed down with Whole Earth fizzys and we were well satisfied Delicious food prepared and served with care and style by a small team in a quirky little basement-vibe room Fully recommend 
positive, Called in for Early Bird but ended up a la carte Wanted somewhere handy near theatre Surprisingly good food and service Tasty hot n sour soup prawns in batter and chow mein noodles Decent menu Modern clean and friendly Would visit again 
positive,We joined about a score of friends many of whom were staying at the hotel for a memorable evening meal Apart from the usual pub restaurant fare they specialise in curries so there was plenty of choice Friendly service generous portions but above all the atmosphere with music and entertainment in one corner the bar in another and areas with both large and small tables It was worth a visit to be right at the heart of the community but there food was most enjoyable too Another great find 
positive,Have eaten here a few times now I always enjoy the food the staff although very busy will always explain the various dishes S E Asian Style of eating is different to the U K order dishes as you go don t try to order three courses or everything will arrive together  I read one complaint review stating that one of the waiting staff did not speak English      come on now its part of the experience and each item on the menu is numbered with a full description of each dish  Probably the closest to authentic Asian food that you will get in W Yorks 
positive, I stumbled across here while trying to find a coffee while waiting for the ferry  It was a Sunday afternoon on a nice sunny day so there was a lot of people out enjoying the weather I managed to park close by on the street but otherwise there was parking further away  I had a Latte and didn`t have to wait long for the drink outside The Prices where reasonable The place was busy but not crowded There is one unisex disabled toilet so you may have to wait for the toilet if required   Would I come here again Most defiantly Would I recommend to other Most defiantly 
positive, Last night we decided to eat at Cotton Eyed Joes and very enjoyable it was to They specialize in BBQ steaks and burgers with a real american style We started with a sharing platter of onion rings wings potatoe wedges with cheese and bacon and nachos with cheese and jalapenos and assorted dips This tasted great very generous in the portion size My wife had the whole rack of ribs for main and I had the BBQ chicken and half rack of ribs The ribs fell off the bone and the chicken was moist and succulent with some very tasty crispy fries and coleslaw The whole experience was helped by the very friendly and efficient staff and a bottle of Proseco We both thoroughly enjoyed it and will be going there again when we fancy eating this style of food again 
positive,Stopped in here for a few drinks Saturday evening It had a decent atmosphere and despite it being packed didn t take long to be served The place is very clean and toilets maintained a decent level of cleanliness even at peak times The terrace gardens are a nice addition also Loads of different beers and ales to choose from and although I didn t eat I did see the bar staff taking food to customers that looked very good  Will definitely visit again next time 
positive,The lunch time buffet is a smaller and cheaper version of the evening buffet still good food but not a massive choice As the time went on the buffet shrunk so at around 2 30 there was not much left but when asked for more the helpful staff went and made some extra food
positive, Really good pub food average bill for family of 4 around 50 with drinks Good selection of standard fayre + a few different options + very very good burger selection a few of these a bit different to the norm but very well done Great place in the Summer big area outside on the grass a hog roast every now and then and a great place to go for walks from across Walton Heath and Mogador in general 
positive, Myself and other half can quite often be found here on a Saturday lunch time enjoying a particular favourite of ours - the burrito For value and taste they are awesome The shabby chic d€÷cor and eclectic mix of customers also add to the charm of the place - catapulting me back to my students days  Other choices on the menu are also well worth a try too Be back again soon  
positive, We were looking for a meal last Thursday evening and had a walk around Hunstanton Came across the Steak and Stilton by chance Despite not having booked the young man in charge was very accommodating and we were shown straight to a table the service was good albeit the man in charge was training someone in the process which didn t distract form the service we all have to learn sometimes The meal was lovely and including drinks a very reasonable price 
positive, We ate here last night on a lovely sunny evening The terrace overlooking Roberts Park & the river is a perfect place to enjoy a great pint of Saltaire Blond  Served in a proper pint-pot Our food order was slightly complicated with some wanting just a starter some bar snacks & some full blown Sunday roasts but the staff were very accommodating & got everything to us at the same time so we could enjoy our meal The food was very nice though quite expensive All in all a nice night though we will be back 
positive, Menu may be restricted but the food is of a good quatity the staff are very friendly and helpful The set menu is very good value 
positive, A favourite for many years I often eat here when in York on work trips A great place for friends but also if you re flying solo  A good wholesome menu of hearty fare in a cosy little restaurant Much better to visit here than some of the big name chains that surround the Minster 
positive,Clean efficient polite helpful staff good menus and featured specials days if you have visited one Brewers Fayre you will know what to expect 
positive, Go to the White Pyramid between 5pm and 6 30 for 2 for 1 early bird discount We were expecting a limited choice from the menu for the early bird but happily there is a good choice Maybe the portion sizes were small No  Not a bit of it the plates were large and full so no complaints Service was very pleasant and prompt too Don t be put off by the tired looking exterior and decoration the food and service is worth it 
positive, Situated on the lovely Church Street just down from the Cathedral this is a charming restaurant with a lovely rustic decor The service was quick friendly and attentive and the food was impressive I had a late breakfast of almond croissant and coffee which was fabulous Unfortunately my partner s boiled egg was quite underdone but she enjoyed the idea of marmite on the accompanying soldiers  Would definitely recommend - just disappointed it s not open Sundays when I m often in Hereford 
positive, The menu is very similar to and why not in Mansfield but that could never be a bad thing The staff were all excellent both friendly and efficient The bar area can become a little cramped but this is only due to the popularity of the venue 
positive, Went with five other people after day at York races Straight to table on arrival and enjoyed great service throughout A couple of the group found the menu a little lacking but I had the minestrone soup for starter and the meatballs for main course and both were excellent These were surpassed however by the profiteroles which were amazing The best part of the evening was the bill we had three courses two bottles of wine and other drinks and the bill was 142 for six of us which I thought was great value for money would go back 
positive, Do not pass by this restaurant A second visit and just as good as the first Great service better food and all in such a professional environment We will be back again Thank you very much 
positive, Disappointed that our fave restaurant in Manchester Ginos now has a 10 service charge on orders This was the reason we ceased eating at Rosso We always tip more than 10 of the bill anyway but that is because of the meal and the service we receive and not because we are ordered to do so  Sorry Gino Much as we love you and your restaurant we won t be eating there again 
positive, surprisingly good burger considering the size great place to go with a group of friends  steer clear of the wings or anyone else eating them  
positive, Food is tapas style so you can try a few options from the menu The king prawns were particularly good The restaurant was very busy when we was there but service was still very good and only a little bit longer The restaurant itself is very nice and modern and Italian styled We were a party of 5 adults and 1 child and the bill was very reasonable If you like Italian food this is definitely a restaurant worth trying 
positive, We visited TGI Fridays  Cheltenham last night Booked for a conservatory table On arrival we were informed of electrical problems with the lighting A few drinks later and in day light we were escorted to a conservatory table and ordered our meals Within minutes the electric for the bar lights and TV screens was cutting out the waiter informed us of associated kitchen problems A few drinks later and a slight wait and the food arrived  Now the point of this report the manager converted an unfortunate situation into a very satisfied customer The bill came fully complimentary for our patience I can t find fault with that at least 100 written off A BIG THANK YOU 
positive, As a local pub its fine and the only proper pub left ion Limehouse History gets you a certain distance with clients as does authenticity The beer is good too which is not as easy as it sounds   The food is good fare especially upstairs and served by friendly staff I ve eaten here opn many occasions now because its guaranteed to be good  
positive,I have eaten hear four times now Twice in the bar and twice in the restaurant The restaurant food is very good but perhaps a little expensive However I had lunch in the bar last Thursday and I have to say the fish and chips were amongst the best that I have ever tasted Excellent 
positive, Go in the evening not lunch time Lunchtime staff and the atmosphere isn t a patch on the evening experience 
positive, We have been here several times and are planning another visit very soon its a robust busy locals chinese restaurant with freshly prepared ingredients very friendly staff and very large portions The only advise - don t over order 
positive, Expectations were low - an Italian restaurant near the inner ring road some 400 m from the centre And the d€÷cor seems a bit kitsch - wrought iron chairs painted frescos with putti roman statues But the service is warm and personal and the food excellent The best cannelloni I have had outside Italy Give it a try 
positive, We visited just after Christmas - 4 adults two dogs and had a lovely lunch Despite being vedry busy we had drinks and food in a timely manner  personally I recommend the cumberland sausage barm 
positive,Let s get this out of the way first If you re looking for a cheap night out look elsewhere  Yes it may not be cheap but it never pretends to be and as is the case you get what you pay for Fantastic food with average portion sizes for similar venues  Try out the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner offer  Great selection of cocktails Definitely give nights a go NEW lanes that are maintained to very high standards  Give Groundhog Mon day a go for bowling  Again quality never comes cheap Tailor your visit around what offer fits you best and enjoy the night 
positive,Had a midweek visit with family and friends I arrived a bit early and was greeted seated and looked after with a cheeky starter Food as usual was very tasty Begum Baher remains my favourite 6 very full and happy diners for 48 can t be at all bad
positive, We actually booked the entire place for our wedding and most of our guests stayed here The place is steeped in history and looks like it is about to fall down like most buildings in York  We chose it due to its location slap bang in the middle of York overlooking the Minster and its quirkyness We checked it out a couple of times on a reccy visit and the food did not disappoint Very traditional English fayre with the odd delve into its medieval roots potted meats etc and great cuts of lamb and beef The ale selection is also excellent with my own favourite BrewDog on tap with guest ales changing regularly The day of our wedding also coincided with the annual ale festival so i was in dreamland The staff were also fantastic and looked after us fantastically well and we have been back several times since location wise you cant beat it well worth a visit and a room for the night if your in York for a few days 
positive, We dropped in while walking around the City on a lazy day off and we were delighted that we did Really nice feel to the place due to a lovely higgledy-piggledy mix of tables chairs and a sofa You get a really friendly welcome here too We just had coffee and scones this time but will definitely give the rest of the menu a try when we go back The coffee was very good I don t say that very often and the fruit scones were delicious with butter clotted cream and jam It s a lovely little place - give it a try 
positive, My wife and I ate off the double deal menu in the evening two for around 12 and thought it provided very good value Nice selection of Belgian beers Somewhere a bit unusual with very friendly staff Different deals are provided during the day so it pays to look carefully at the menu some dishes are only served at certain times Recommended 
positive, A rarity these days good well cooked but simple pub meals generous and well presented in addition to a warm atmosphere Very relaxed and refreshingly not trying to present food with a modern twist 
positive, Quantus is located in a quiet road off Chiswick High Road and could easily be overlooked The atmosphere is quite intimate the staff are attentive and friendly and the menu does not disappoint The cooking is very good and the recipes have clearly been thought through with some care and originality The end result was a very good dinner in discreet & pleasant surroundings altogether a rather agreeable discovery 
positive,If you like a traditional high street indian then this isn t the place for you  We found Ganges to be elegantly styled with attentive service by charming staff delicious food that offers some interesting flavours and a reasonably priced varied menu We ll be back soon 
positive, Arrived around 3pm - around 10 other customers but my friend and I were there to enjoy a couple of the excellent cocktails and smoked salmon sandwiches after a local business meeting as an alternative to going to a pub We were not dissappointed at all and we shared three different cocktails a Margarita a Long Island Iced Tea and a Caipirinha all expertly prepared by Max the Bar Manager I have always found the staff both friendly and efficient and Julius the owner was extremely welcoming and in good form The lovely Simone added the female interest I have only eaten bar snacks there including during my recent Stag Party but I am sure that the restaurant food is of an equally high standard The evenings are generally busy with an interesting cross section of customers either in the bar the restaurant or weather permitting relaxing in the large front seating area 
positive, We have eaten here several times both as a couple and with friends and we have never been disappointed The menu is super and there is plenty of choice Service is prompt but not pushy Coffee is excellent and it is hard to fault this restaurant You will need to book for Fridays and Saturdays 
positive, My girlfriend and I visited in January after wanting to try the place out for ages and we were not disappointed I knew ages in advance that I would be ordering the T Bone and thoroughly enjoyed it   it barely fit on the plate and was cooked to perfection The fillet steak my girlfriend ordered was delicious too and she ranked it very highly and probably the best she d had  We have a Tastecard which MPW s participate in and took advantage of 50 off our food bill by ordering 3 courses each Starters  potted duck was nice but not something we d order again and Calamari which was as good as anywhere I d had it before The desserts were nice but not sure if have enjoyed them as much at full price The only downside was the 10 service charge I ve only experienced this in London before so was a little surprised - we always leave a tip but would prefer to choose how much we leave based on the experience 
positive, Visited on the 16th of February for breakfast at around 11 30am - although it was extremely busy and was only 1 table left which is what we got Everything was great - food was lovely warm took 9 minutes to reach us from point of ordering Lovely and friendly staff Great example of a wetherspoons pub Recommended if wanting a breakfast out and about 
positive,An enjoyable Sunday lunch Despite it being a busy bank holiday weekend we found a table for 4 of us 3 x belly pork roasts and a New York burger later and everyone left full and happy 
positive, For my husband and myself having a dog Sara s Tearoom being dog friendly is very attractive to us I found the young teenage girls polite obliging and they did indeed smile My reply to the comments from Norwich Dude are I personally know of Sparrows nest which is expensive and the Staff there certainly do not smile  The Italian Coffee is first rate admittedly the Scones were small and a little dry Our Jacket potatoes were fine the Chili filling was home made and was very tasty and most importantly reasonably priced The Loyalty Card is a welcome bonus  The small garden is an absolute delight a peaceful haven awash with flowers Such commitment from the owner Full praise to her  we shall be visiting again and wish you good luck and good weather for the forthcoming months 
positive, Nicely prepared food which is not too greasy The table heater was dirty as was the cutlery They need to improve their washing up 
positive, Good to very good food Service is usually prompt friendly and professional A good place to meet for lunch 
positive, Popped in for a light lunch consisting of just one starter and one main A virtually rmpty restaurant but this didn t detract from a generally warm and happy atmosphere A pleasant service 
positive, Nice little Korean place Little hard to find as it s of the beaten track Great value lunch menu I was stuffed and trust me I m a ganit like I said very authentic kimchi Tried saying thanks in Korean but the girl said she was Chinese 
positive, Staff helpful on arrival As a group meal selection pr-ordered Names called out and first course served Took a while to serve the group with others waiting stating Please start Felt a bit of a lemon as the only one missed out Duly arrive with apology Main course steak perfect and fine flavor with small serving of hand cooked chips Having just returned from fine dining in Hove Sussex where a bowl of a small selection of fresh vegetables was always offered disappointed to fine none several others wished for the same 
positive, Great food lovely views over the river great for families high chair for babies very relaxing love to come in summer and sit in the large garden will definitely come back Stella Artois on tap   
positive, First time to visit relatively new restaurant in Wetherby and went for a work Christmas meal on 22 12 10 9 of us went and we booked in advance A week and a half before going we needed to change our booking date which was accepted with no problem even at this busy time of year which was good Food and service was very good with friendly and warm atmosphere in well appointed newly built restaurant area When one of our party wanted to alter the way her meat was cooked this was done quickly without fuss and happily The only down side was the lack of choice of bitter but selection of wine was good Would definitely go back with or without work 
positive,The cakes were wonderful cappucinos hit the mark very quant very close to Warwick Castle a little gift shop too 
positive, There is nothing posh about Birdies Paper table cloths Nothing matches ie cutlery crockery furniture Menu is written on a board Birdies is extremely popular & you have to book The service is not fantastic but the food is amazing I would describe this place as maybe a little trendy that attracts people of all ages There is plenty of choice of starters from Bacon and advocado salad to Sweetbreads Bread & Olives are a must Mainly fish for mains & a good choice of desserts Portions are generous & food quality will bring you back time & again Unfortunately on our latest visit the menu had changed & there was no Sea Bass in general it was not quite up to it s usual standards However Birdies is still one of the best around You should book at least a week in advance for Saturday evenings even 2 weeks during the summer months 
positive, Drove past this place and from the outside it looked nice On going in the staff were very friendly and attentive The menu was fairly wide and a good selection on the kids menu Sunday roasts went down well with the veg being especially good  Great place for lunch on an autumnal day 
positive,We turned up early evening without reservation and received a warm welcome form the cheery staff Service was efficient and the food good All in all a good pub food experience and good value for money 
positive,We ve twice visited The Globe and have been very pleased with the food and service There could be better signage as to where the toilets restrooms are located Apart from this it s a very good pub 
positive, i was out with my girl friend for dinner on sep 3 2011 to be honest buffet had plenty of choice for food and service is also good sweets are awesome i enjoyed that night by having dinner in flavourz i will Defoe return 
positive, A good find Hmmm  get take away or eat inside the restaurant for 4x the price I think I ll get the take away thank you very much The pieces of fish were HUGE so I can t even image what the jumbo sized portions are like I was greedy and ordered the large portion of chips which were great and still tasty cold a couple of hours later I liked the care in which the guy salted the chips and tossed them slightly before wrapping it up for take away  All in all friendly staff and great fish and chips After all it s the healthiest meal for all the family according to the print copy on the package 
positive, One of us had been offered a special deal by one of the promo companies When we sat down we were told that whilst it was a member of the Hakassan group we had arrived at the wrong restaurant The other one it seems is Japanese and by which time nobody wanted to move albeit it was our first time here and were fearful the a la carte menu would mean paying treble of what we expected At least 3 Managers came to see us offering nothing but excuses and no help at all We dined enjoying the experience immensely but still feeling a little quite a lot disappointed I got up to visit the mens room and came upon a very impressive looking guy who turned out to be the General Manager of the whole group who bothered to look at the ill founded offer and investigated it thoroughly and agreed it was totally out of order to market the restaurant like this I ahd told him previously it s like going to a football match and the wrong team comes out to play He was extremely understanding apologetic and made some decent concessions that made us feel much better Restaurant has amazing food and ambiance 
positive, Excellent food with old school service and hospitality however the restaurant could do with a makeover decor wise Prices are really good too 
positive, This dining experience actually turned out to be a nice little surprise  As we were paying 20 for steak or lobster chips and salad in central London the initial expectation was reserved  having eaten at other steakhouses in London spending a lot more we were prepared for a nice meal but nothing amazing  It is safe to say we were wrong  The whole experience was excellent we were warmly greeted and shown to our reserved table Drinks order was taken swiftly and they arrived in good time  When it came to ordering the food it was surprisingly difficult especially as you only have 2 options I am a bit of a foody nothing majorly elaborate so actually only having a choice between 2 gave me more of a feeling of missing out than I was expecting luckily the missus is also a bit of a foody so we settled on 1 of each and shared  The steak was excellent cooked to perfection with a cut that surpassed expectation for the price tag The lobster was equally excellent we went for the steamed option rather than the grill option I think that is a post steam thing but it is good to have a choice  Both were fresh moist and delicious steak was medium rare and we could have easily had more the salad was basic but nicely presented with a nice dressing and endless chips was a nice add-on but not needed on this occasion  For Steak Lobster and a couple of drinks I don t think 50 was a bad price to pay for 2 people at all would definitely recommend this restaurant 
positive, Great food very freindly staff Very good value Would not hesitate to eat here again were I to visit Chester again Will recommend to others 
positive,We ate on the top floor the ground floor has a nice looking bar  There was a good view out onto night time Exchange St The tapas style food offered good choices with the suggestion being to try 2-3 dishes per person Some of the dishes were really tasty chicken wings and Spanish patatas One dish a fish stew had everything in place and looked good but lack any real flavour Did the cook forget the stock that night Good ambiance friendly staff and enough about it for us to want to give it another go and try some different dishes 
positive, We had a family meal at this super italian restaurant recently the atmosphere was great and the staff were really helpful There were 10 of us in the party of all ages a number of us had the chicken della casa a superb choice with chorizo sausage in a red spicy sauce It was devine those who had steaks said they were done to perfection the younger ones had a children s menu and really enjoyed the whole experience There is a very extensive menu and the staff are pleased to explain the dishes to you All in all a great night out We will definitely be going again 
positive, i like fish and chip from nice clean the funky fish every time i go to play in east park this place may open only few years the fish is really tasty and chips are very good too 
positive, Read about this on Wikitravel as it comes highly recommended by the cabbies that frequent it On arrival I was seated and after I placed my order I was served complimentary fresh prawns with bread and butter a very nice thought I ordered cod and chips with a bottle of house white The food arrived and the portions were huge and only managed to eat the fish While I was there I did bump into a classmate who s now a cabbie and had great interaction with My main disappointment came when I settled the bill only to realise the waitress cashier shamelessly overcharged me 5 for the house wine I wouldn t say don t frequent Superfish as their food is very good but beware of the slim ponytail 
positive, High quality Meze in good sized portions Excellent local atmosphere that beats the big chains hands down Friendly efficient service that felt genuine not forced 
positive, Lots of plusses- interesting menu- wow factor puddings- great service  Good wine and beers First course took a while to arrive so I suggest giving bread dips The wall bench was a touch uncomfortable for the height of the table But good for vegetarians and we will return soon 
positive, Prefer to dine in rather than get takeaway  The restaurant is not buzzing but really nice comfortable and clean Would recommend for families especially for toddlers and lil uns  Fish is really really nice and fresh and is not drained in cheap oily batter chips are a bit chunky and potatoey but still nice  Overall nice place would recommend 
positive,The Grapes has been the Hub for a nice meal and drink within the Formby Freshfield area and with its multimillion pound refurbishment just before Christmas it s yet to disappoint I have titled this review smart casual for one very good reason this pub is a fine balance between somewhere nice to eat as a couple as well as a great socialising place to meet with friends and family for a few drinks The smart finish inside of oyster blue paint and varnished wood gives the pub a very classical vibe the bar space has been decreased after the refurb allowing for more space to stand and make orders They have also incorporated a specific area to eat meals which used to be open for people to sit with a drink but has now been allocated for meals I have only ever eaten there once and wasn t dissaponted I mean don t expect Michelin style food here people but when I say fine pub grub you get the picture Totally worth a visit if you re in the area as I feel that this is the poshest pub in Formby Hope this helps 
positive, Having visited this place many times over the years this place never disappoints while they will never win Michelin stars and the dining experience is not going to suited for those regular restaurant goers this place offers a lovely environment and a decent menu for those looking for a quick pit stop for lunch 
positive, Enjoyed the food We had a selection of starters and a main to share Prices reasonable Felt that the service let the side down as we felt rushed and unloved or it would have been 5 stars 
positive,We make sure to enjoy lunch here every time we visit Padstow  As usual the food was delicious especially the Pulled Pork fried meatballs The pizza s are very nice but I prefer mine a little less fancy by way of ingredients That s not a complain as they are made extremely well We did miss the fresh crab on toasted brochette bread this year   The staff are lovely and look after your every need  Looking forward to 2017 already
positive, Great Value for money Kids can play as long as they like for 5 There is a pub right next door  part of the same building so you can relax and enjoy a drink  food while kids play Drinks are a little pricey though 
positive, I think its that kind of place reaaly nice for family or friends during the lunch Simple food but effective We had a really nice meal in here not amazing but really nice 
positive, Very friendly with a decent pool table and a decent selection of drinks Also shows live sport and is really the young persons pub in the village 
positive, only ate here on one occasion and that was for breakfast and i have to say it was excellent dont know the cost it was included in the price of our stay 
positive, Today was special as my favourite Godson celebrated his 22nd Birthday and his choose this restaurant for his Birthday meal Along with my best friend my Godson Mother and eight members of the family we meet for his special evening I knew of the restaurant as we are local to Clevedon however don t expect it easy to park near by They have a small car park but the local roads are very busy and not easy to find a parking space close by Best go by text or get someone to drop you off especially if it is raining rather like this evening The restaurant is down some stairs and set in a French type celler rather charming but a little noisy as lots of full tables and the conversation echoed throughout so a little hard to hear each other speak The waitress was very attentive and soon brought our drinks while we selected our meals Good choice and you can pre order if a large party to save time We choose not to do this as happy to wait the extra time for our food to be prepared I won t go into all the selection as the menu is available to view on their website We were all happy with our choices and the food was well prepared and very good  It may be slightly on the expensive side but there is a special of a two or three set meals during the week or for an early diner on Fridays in all this evening was around 30 each with two courses with wine beer and coffees  We chose not to have a desert of my friend as always had provide an excellent Birthday cake which the restaurant presented to us along with the usual Happy Birthday sang by everyone much to my Godsons horror  So highly recommended and well enjoyed Thank you 
positive, This is the best restaurant in Plymouth for Good food and nice ambience There is accommodation but it wasn t used as we live close by There is a lack of adequate car parking space at busy timesd 
positive, Good breakfasts and excellent salads at lunch Lovely sun terrace to the rear  The music though will ensure the shortest possible visit 
positive, always pop in on my visits to see my parents and the barmaid Beth American  always makes us feel welcome   would recommend this pub to anyone in the area 
positive,We use this chain when we can and it is always consistent despite the location The olives are of the best we have ever had and even though it was a busy Friday night service was quick and attentive 
positive, We were staying in Weymouth kids wanted chinese this one was nearby with good TA reviews so we ordered food Everything was hot and well cooked not too greasy and reasonably priced for portion size Possibly not as good as back home but really tasty and no complaints from the family would I go back Yes would I recommend Yes 
positive,The burgers and starters here were very tasty and with some creative combinations the drinks were also quite good but most menu options are a little bit on the pricey side I wasn t a fan of the popcorn shrimp but the burgers were impressive The service was a bit slow and it was a bit cramped but i suppose it s a popular place A good place for halal diner style food 
positive, This establishment just caught my eye when walking down the high street it looked well maintained and different to the places I normally visit I visited on a Wednesday and it had a good mixture of customers such as family s and groups of friends Service was quick I ordered one of there steaks with a peri-peri sauce which was cooked correctly all the food was hot and fresh so no complaint s there They had a good selection of milkshakes it was hard to choose which one I wanted  Unlike other reviews I received good service staff where friendly and attentive It would have been nice to have received a check back on my food but there was no issue s anyway Price was correct for the quality of the food and it was a good place to just stop by for a quick meal 
positive,Attended the recent 6th anniversary of the opening Very good food nice setting generous hosts Staff work hard and good service On one recent visit for dinner with guests had to complain about one dish but otherwise very good Very highly recommended Lots of parking 
positive,2 adults and 2 older children went along at 4 30 on Sunday and it was very quiet although the booths that we wanted to sit at were booked up apparently The orders were taken quickly and efficiently and the food arrived soon after The dough balls are our preferred starter followed by 2 excellent lasagnes a gluten free pizza for my gluten free wife excellent but why are they smaller than ordinary pizzas  and while I m at it why are there fewer gluten free dough balls than the normal portion  My son doesn t eat cheese and the waitress wasn t fazed by our request fior a pizza with no cheese The main courses arrived just as my daughter was eating her last mouthful of starter maybe a bit too quick off the mark there  They took our Tesco vouchers without question and so we just paid for the drinks As usual we found Pizza Express reliable and friendly with good food and service although this one is not as an impressive building as the nearby Clifton restaurant in Bristol 
positive, the food was good for the price the staff were very accommodating we had two steak meals which where very well cooked we will return in the near future 
positive, Popped into The Madras with a friend recently whilst visiting Hull We opted for the set menu 5 courses for around 9 maybe less which included starter main course choice of rice chips or bread a vegetable side curry and ice cream or coffee to finish  It is fantastic value with good quality food and a good choice on the menu The service was great - would definitely pop back 
positive,Myself my wife my little brother who has Downs Syndrome and our 10 year old son visited this restaurant for dinner on the Friday along with some drinks  we found the premises very spacious and the food was very good and reasonably priced  also had breakfast on the Saturday morning dinner again on the Saturday night & again breakfast on the Sunday morning  All in we found the food very good   however on the Sunday morning we did have to wait 45 minutes for our food to arrive looked like shortage of staff   Only real complaint was that the premises on all 4 visits would be that it was far to warm that made it very uncomfortable   but on a positive note   the staff all came across as very friendly  The Meikle Family 
positive, My girlfriend and I went to Zeret for our anniversary 24th February 2014 because of the high rating of the restaurant on TripAdvisor First I can t say that the place is romantic outside it looks like a bar and it has little charm Inside is more looked after but it isn t a venue that impresses you for the setting However when it comes to the food it s a different story I took one of their typical dishes with their flat bread upon which you have to put all their sauces It was amazing Simple but original and a totally different taste from those I am used to The ingredients were nothing special you can find them in every store but the feeling and the experience were unique Total price in the region of 30 00 It seems cheap but we simply ordered a main dish each we drank tap water and we had one dessert In a word reasonable Really worth visiting 
positive, very nice discovery when walking in without a reservation The lovely starter salads made my lady smile I loved the fish soup only to name two items Overall it was quite delicious food the desserts could be a bit more inovative but overall we shall return 
positive, I recently returned to El Paso to find that it s moved next door into what used to be the Moorfoot Tavern It s now a bit larger and posher but it still has a reasonably intimate atmosphere the food is still excellent and the service friendly Our bill inc alcoholic drinks was a very reasonable 20 per head The only thing missing is draught beer or more specifically any real ales We ll definitely be going again 
positive, This place is always packed - tables are a bit tight but it s worth it A selection of appetisers to share is a great way to sample different things - stuffed olives sea bream carpaccio crispy squid tuna confit salad all great Cocktails were good too - the lemon granita with Prosecco and cassis really sharp and tasty Two of the three of us had a great main  ravioli and duck ragout linguine but the ricotta rigatone was too big and the cured meat with it very fatty They took it off the bill Very attentive service and great ambience 
positive,I really like this place the service is very good with nice friendly staff and the menu has a good variety of food I really like the big open space this place provides will return when next in the area 
positive, Love it here Where else can you get a whole bloody roast chicken delivered to your table Great beer garden friendly enough staff and nice huts to move into with patio heaters for when it gets a bit chilly Only one toilet for the blokes though which isnt the best when two East End hipsters emerge from it looking perky on a Sunday afternoon REALLY That being said it still a great little find and it s nice to see some great boozers sprouting up around Clapton 
positive, Ten of us dined here on Saturday 14th November Escorted to the table 10 mins earlier then booked and the drinks order was quickly taken Wide range of food ordered although first course took awhile to arrive the food itself was hot and fresh Wide choice of many options for the main course however we did have an issue with two of the main meals but in fairness to the restaurant this was quickly resolved to everyones satisfaction and the food was enjoyed by all Desserts excellent When the bill came everything was as ordered point to note on our party of ten the service charge had been included 
positive,Great cocktails drinks and decor Always really busy though so get their early Takes a long time to get served Pretty pricey too 
positive, Perfect for that family dinner when you can t be bothered to cook at home Good value Good grub Staff could be a bit more aware Had to ask for table to be cleared before ordering desserts 
positive, Friendly staff good food friendly service But please warm it up big single glazed windows don t keep the heat in An enjoyable place to be and I ll certainly be back in the Spring 
positive,We were guests at a wedding recently and thoroughly enjoyed this alternative and quirky venue Although not the biggest it felt homely with plenty of nooks and crannies to it The staff were so helpful and always willing to offer assistance The food was ample and very decent indeed with the drinks surprisingly well priced considering it was a wedding most venues see this as a chance to ramp up the price  Brilliant really enjoyed it Well done to all the staff 
positive, Arrived at the pub for a business lunch with a new client and could not find the staff to me more accommodating the menu had a good variety and everything we had was really well cooked The pub has a lot of old world charm and found the whole experience very pleasant - the speed with which we served despite the pub being very busy was perfect for a tight lunchtime schedule - will definitely use it again 
positive,Middle eastern small plates - with the sweet potato wedges with tahini and balsamic getting a special mention Great value and good veggie selection If I m being picky - music was probably a bit loud but then I was the oldest man in there and the onlu one without a beard 
positive, Frequent visitor of Mango Tree The place will never let you down However you might find it slightly overpriced so would recommend the 50 or 40 top table disccount 
positive,Quality of food is good and you are well looked after but it trades on it s Fernley-Whittingstall ownership as you would expect and portions have got smaller recently but prices are still high 
positive, Having just checked out latest reviews for this amazing venue before confirming my next visit I am disappointed to read last entry This unique restaurant not only offers excellent quality and choice for a fraction of London prices BUT each order is freshly prepared to the customers requirement and certainly worth waiting for If you want fast food go to a burger joint I will certainly go back again and again and again   Besides I have a thumb war to win 
positive, Cosy little restaurant food was very nice staff were efficient Given the table next to door and carry out area which was not ideal 
positive, Visited Sunday evening with my wife We selected from the small plates menu All the food was lovely well presented and tasty Would recommend the battered halloumi cheese The service was also pleasant and a nice environment We will be back I m sure 
positive, Went into Trinity Muffin Break today Had great service from a young lady who was very smiley and funny We ordered the toastie and muffin deal which was very good value Really loved the coffee and the welcoming environment would definitely recommend 
positive, A little overpriced but in all fairness the food was excellent the chicken starter was cooked to perfection and the portions are quite generous Only given 4 stars due to the biriyani not coming with a sauce had to be ordered extra and the little poppadoms whilst being pretty are annoying as we were all constantly picking clumps out of our teeth Well worth a visit   It s not a traditional menu and if you prefer a lot of heat you need to ask they will spice up the dish for you 
positive, Consistently good takeaway Chinese food over many years Sweet & Sour Chicken and the Thai Red Curry are two of my favourite dishes at the Golden Flame Plenty of parking to make life easier 
positive, We came here when it first opened to try it out and were not impressed Aesthetically pleasing to the eye but food was well below par the mixed grill was resemblent of a kebab shop overcooked dry and lacking flavor  However they have come a long way since then and we could not fault the food this time Meat full of flavour and tender The only negative is the lack of bread with the mezes 4 small pieces of flatbread with 2 big ramikins of hummus and tzatziki  Could do with an extra waitress  waiter as the girls upstairs looked rushed off their feet on a busy Saturday night  Overall I will definetely be visiting again as it probably is one of the best Turkish restaurants in Northamptonshire 
positive, Quite expensive for a chain restaurant but I found all the staff were very good friendly and helpful Good ambiance The chicken wings starter was excellent best I ve had beef chimichanga was very good although could do with more beef Salad very good desert was average and drinks are on the pricey side To sum up I d go again 
positive, This restaurant situated in the basement of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge - it is surprisingly roomy and we found it lively and buzzy The food was not exceptional however the service and atmosphere was great Great wine list I would return again 
positive, This is a little gem that I only just discovered 10 minutes from home Nice food good value and highly recommended Will be back soon Thanks  
positive, Visit to see daughter at University led us to city centre for meal and chose Veneziana as other options nearby didn t inspire Have to say was not at all disappointed food was very good and generous helpings Thought overall price was good value for money Restaurant quiet when we visited so cannot comment on speed and attentiveness of service Would go again 
positive,Had a three night stay in Liverpool and ate here on 2 of the 3 days  Friendly welcome on arrival and quickly shown to a table  Fair selection of burger choices and side dishes to add on as required together with both soft and alcoholic drinks  Order taken quickly and food arrived in less than 10 minutes  Not the cheapest but well worth paying the extra for quality  Will certainly seek out Byrons in other cities 
positive, This restaurant food is really good value for money You can have a choice of four different meats pork beef turkey or gammon  When you have selected your meat which is served to you you then help yourself to all sorts of vegetables Go back for more if required Reasonably priced but a couple of pounds dearer on a Sunday Can be VERY busy on a Sunday and of course at Christmas 
positive, This was my regular for most of the 80 s but have hardly been in for a while Great service from the staff - not intrusive but friendly and welcoming Good choice of food served nice and hot on a cold wintery day and comprehensive range of drinks 
positive, We booked a table to eat here on the Saturday of the August Bank Holiday weekend We were met by friendly staff and shown to a discrete table downstairs Our drinks order was taken within a couple of minutes of sitting down and delivered only a couple of minutes later The menu was varied and appealing and we both decided to order from the 3-course set menu which had a reasonable choice The food was well-prepared looked appetising on the plate and each course was very tasty We had a couple of drinks each and our bill came to a very respectable 50 including tip  which we thought was good value for a 3-course meal and drinks I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for good food a relaxed atmosphere and decent value 
positive,Happened upon this place whilst in town The rolls are enormous which to be honest caught me off guard as was only reasonably hungry but can hardly complain and while not the best I ve had were certainly good quality and tasty The waitress was also very helpful and attentive Definitely worth a visit and will be back again with a more ravenous appetite - 
positive, Booked a table for 4 just before Christmas  I called a few days before to book a table but on arrival there seemed to be a bit of panic on behalf of the waiting staff as they couldn t find my reservation The manager took over and quickly found a table for our party and a potential complaint was averted  The menu was extensive and contained both safe options and a few items that were a bit off piste The food was served in a timely manner but not rushed it was hot tasty and imaginatively presented Staff were attentive without being subservient  The final surprise was that the bill was remarkably reasonable - we did have to question one item on the bill but this was dealt with quickly and without fuss or question In short - pleasantly surprised We ll be back 
positive, Went for a meal with my partner booked table for 9pm and it was still busy was shown table but for our first time we would have like to have been talked through the menu we knew it was Italian tapas but had to ask recommend number of dishes Food was lovely good portion size and very tasty Staff were friendly and the chef brought out our food nice touch My parter had seafood stew beautiful didn t have room for dessert but will visit again to sample these next time Would recommend 
positive, A combination of 100 s of beers lagers & wines & a different take on food make for a lively venue in Birmingham It s an ordinary  bar with great food There are too many beers to chose from - which seems a hard criticism really I didn t eat on this blvisit but have had the vegitarian dish before - Halloumi cheese which was very good  Well worth a visit on a road full of good pubs this one stands out 
positive, Nice place friendly staff meals where lovely the ribs were nice and the chicken Kiev steak pizza all went down a treat defo return 
positive, Just recently found out they have a brand new head chef what a relief so good wish I knew his name Last guy was a shambles Great service think her name was Pippa so sweet clearly new but despite this was very attentive and understandable to my very old Mother  Think the manager on was Kath or Kat but she s clearly doing a good job Shame to hear Georgia is leaving she s always made our weekends special Hopefully they ll convince her to stay However this place looks like it deserves a better rap than it s getting on here clearly had a bad couple of weeks but hey we are all human I will be back very very soon  One last thing Yes fires are great but glad their boiler is being fixed this weekend 
positive, I ve been there today for a team lunch and I would definitely recommend for their USA southern food Everything looked interesting on the menu ranging from Bbq sandwiches burgers and deep fried sea food dishes We even benefited from their weekday lunch deal which includes starter or desert plus a main and a drink for 10 which is incredible value 
positive,Enjoyed Friday and Saturday evening meals 29th and 30th july All 3 of us were presented with excellent main courses of Lamb steak  home made stew  ham off the bone and excellent desserts all accompanied by quality ales and friendly service Surprised to see the negative views of a customer in june but i suppose nobody can get it right all the time but at least its evident that the proprietor takes these complaints seriously look forward to an early return to this excellent venue I am sure that in the unlikely event that anything dissapoints me i will make it known and it will be put right 
positive,Set in a lovely busy part of town Jamie s Italian was just as I had hoped  Lovely food good service well priced and a beautiful setting  I visited here in a lunch break so i was short on time and had a reservation for 1 30 arrived bang on time with my girlfriend arriving 2 mins prior  Got a drink at the bar and then informed that the table wasn t ready yet   we finally sat down at 1 45 I understand that this isn t a long waiting time but when you have a limited amount of time I did expect to be seated rather promptly  The meal in itself was perfect the food came out quick and was very well cooked as you d expect  Not badly priced 2 main courses 1 cocktail 1 beer was 50  So well worth a visit as long as you re not pushed for time 
positive, Went to the Harrow today for a late lunch with 5 friends n had one of the best burgers I ve ever tasted Great staff n lovely Atmosphere Will definitely visit again Yumma      
positive,Sirloin steak was excellent my companions salmon in a hollandaise sauce was superb Vegetables were cooked to perfection and the service was outstanding Loses a point due to the subdued lighting within the restaurant Would still highly recommend a visit
positive, Arranged to meet a friend here and because it it s location just off the M3 it was the first place I thought of that would be easy to give directions to I have already reviewed this place and I didn t give it a good report so I was planning on meeting up and moving on swiftly to another place  However on arrival my friends had beaten me to the place and had already bought a round of drinks - so we had to stay Anyway on entering it was obvious the place had changed Nice welcoming sofas in the bar area now and a book case with books to read It s made a real difference to the place as you now have somewhere nice to sit and drink There are still tables elsewhere for diners The main thing that hit me were the bar staff - really welcoming and very friendly and efficient The place was also buzzing so obviously the changes are for the better  Didn t eat here just had drinks but we stayed for several hours Will definitely go back again next time with food 
positive, Lovely setting by the river Good service Lovely food Frozen ASDA pizza box in the kitchen - yes the one I had just eaten 
positive, Went here for evening meal on the last day of May  Good selection of food and all tasted OK Waiting staff buzzing about all the time  Dining area a bit dull Price pretty good 
positive,We ve only tried a takeaway from here but it was very good There s a nice range of fish dishes on the menu plus all the old standards but with the options of chicken or lamb tikka rather than just chicken or lamb The chicken tikka Dhansak was delicious as was the Muktaj The sag paneer was a little disappointing Excellent nan and poppadoms Decent pint of bitter whilst I was waiting to pick it up too 
positive, After some Fawlty Towers-like experiences in a number of establishments in nearby Lyme Regis & Seaton we were ready for something nice And we got it Beer is a lovely little town large village The restaurant was busy but we had almost over the top attentiveness The waiters kept popping over to check we were ok - it seems that they have acted on some of the criticism on earlier reports  The time for main courses to arrive was just being on the verge of being too long but we enjoyed our starters and were topped up with drinks so it didn t matter We were on holiday  There were five of us and we all had something different and all of us enjoyed what we had  We would return there and after the appalling service we d had at a number of English-managed places these warm and friendly Bangladeshis made this last meal of our holiday a very pleasant one 
positive, I always go healthy option grilled stuff Lots of salad choice of suaces Not too badly priced Friendly staff 
positive, First visit to Vx Bristol for some vegan junk food The place has a nice atmosphere and was really busy when we went at 14 00  We ordered Soy Oreo Milkshake and Chai Latte to drink Both drinks were really good and the Soy Oreo Milkshake was the best I have ever had There was just one thing that bugged me and that was both drinks only half filled the cups They either need some smaller cups or need to just fill the ones they have to the top If not you feel like you have only got half of the drink  For food we had a Vx burger and a Quesadilla Both were really tasty but both were very messy to eat and as they came in baskets you could get yourself in a bit of a state The burger tasted really excellent but the Quesadilla although really tasty was a very big wrap with very little in it Only a quarter of the wrap had filling and it was so runny and sloppy that it just split the wrap and it all oozed out of the bottom It tasted really good but needs something to bulk it out and stop it being too sloppy  Overall I would definitely recommend it but I hope they continue to perfect their products 
positive,Visited the KD a few weeks ago food was great fish excellent and desserts yummy Staff and service was excellent even though restaurant really busy Food obviously cooked to order Will certainly visit again Good atmosphere 
positive,Enjoyed a very tasty and spicy disk of Chicken Naga recently after a recommendation from the waiter who first checked that I liked spicy food The food was very tasty and flavoursome rather than overly hot The restaurant always appear to have plenty of couples who come for meals and take aways The atmosphere is always better when it is a little busier and Indian music is playing 
positive,Regular visitors to Blacker Hall Farm both to buy food from the shop and also eat in the restaurant cafe Recent visit this week was excellent While the restaurant cafe is always busy we were able to find a table and order quickly Food was superb and I would recommend you try the Smoked Brisket Burger Staff are friendly and the service was good It is a great place for families to eat with a good children s menu and outside space to keep them amused We will be returning again 
positive,I have been dining several times in Piccolino and I have to say that even being a franchise Chain the food is excellents  Good points in Piccolino s - Several fishes I would recommend spaddinni - Good selection of starters - The menu is changed each seasson not big changes but you can see new stuff - the service is very good I had once a bad experience with a waiter she was a bit stupid  but I have to say that the rest of the times the waiters are very servicing and nice - Pizzas are very good thin and crispy - I don t drink wine but I think they have a good selection of bottles  I go very often to this place and I will continue  Eat on the menu with a beer a main course and a starter is about 25  
positive,We had very good food efficiently served as a pre-theatre meal The food was fresh tasty and not pre-cooked The atmosphere in the restaurant was superb with people clearly enjoying the experience and most anticipating going to a show in the nearby theatres 
positive, I heard about Legends on the Thursday and was keen to see if it lived up to the rave reviews I managed to grab a last minute cancellation for the Sat night and was happy to discover the food and friendly service was even better than expected The soft shell crab was excellent and the wasabi blows your socks off better than I ve had in Tokyo The menu is a real mixture of tastes with something for everyone A nice informal atmosphere and delicious food well worth a visit I ll defiantly be going again and soon 
positive, although I live in north London had my parents visiting the UK just a few weeks back and after reading a few reviews on TripAdvisor we decided to give it a go for a Sunday roast  really easy to find just a couple of hundred meters from Greenwich park entrance  we have been welcomed by the owner and chef who`s name is Tom brilliant hardworking Irish guy  who talked us through the menu from A to Z recommending his personal favorite dishes  Food-wise I must admit that most likely it was only my fourth Sunday roast I ever had in London but besides that we had lamb pork beef and ham with the BEST gravy I ever had in my life and obviously plenty of vegetables on the side after that we had about three pies to share and a couple of whiskeys drinking quite a few guinnesses through the lunch  you might wonder then how much we paid well only 64 for the three of us bargain of the weekend  will Definitely be back and I strongly recommend it as suggested by Tom is it best to book only a couple of days in advance place has got about 7 8 tables  Riccardo 
positive,Went to all bar one as the meeting place for the rest of the group and the atmosphere was great we were debating whether to eat there but as it was a saturday night and quite crowded in there we decided not to was a good place for casual drinks the starting place for a night out 
positive, Belgo has quite a limited menu for food but as you really should choose the mussels which have a range of exotic flavours this doesn t matter Service was fast The beer menu is extensive with something for everyone 
positive,Great friendly service a nice simple menu to choose from and delicious pizzas done well highly reccomended
positive, We went there with a friend who lives locally for an evening meal  The pub itself is very charming in a village location and only a mile from the A1 M at Scotch Corner - so very accessible for travellers  At first sight the main menu looked a bit pedestrian with not a huge choice However there was a Specials Board which was almost as long as the main menu That s a good sign since it indicates probably menu that changes quite frequently presumably to reflect food that s available or in season  The meal we had was absolutely fine and the bar and waiting staff were polite and attentive  All in all a very pleasant experience 
positive, The rasam soup was great  The chicken chettinad & dosa was good as was the parota Overall a nice experience  
positive, Was in Newcastle the other evening with friends and went to Mama Mia s Italian restaurant at 46 Pudding Chare close to Grey Street and the Theatre Royal We had a lovely meal in a very clean and pleasant restaurant with attentive staff Two minor niggles - firstly it is situated in a narrow street with no immediate parking and secondly there was no disabled toilet Other that that we certainly would visit again 
positive, Good food good service not too long to wait - and not expensive either 
positive, The food was hot & tasty The views and sunshine fantastic and when i came to pay the bill it was mega monday so mega cheap Brilliant 
positive, I had been at the River Cottage Canteen before but went again last week The starters my friend and I had figs and chicken wings were very good especially the figs though the concept of urban honey sounds a bit to silly For main we had the lamb and the pulled pork Both were very good Compared to my previous visit - probably more than a year ago - I had the feeling that the portions of the main dishes were far smaller than before The prices don t really translate anymore what is served in terms of amount The selection of types of cheese we had for dessert was very good A couple of nice strong types of cheese 
positive, So much was so different - an hour-long queue to get in no poppadoms and the most interesting inventive posh street food that I ve had in an Indian restaurant I loved it 
positive, right on a beautiful beach good service good value good food very reasonable wait time very nice no faults at all 
positive, We were looking up for a toilet when we saw BHS there is a lift to the restaurant the restaurant is extremely spacious and we took a window seat we had some tea and cakes as a mid-morning break it is very clean nice tables and chairs and nice staff the prices are quite reasonable and value give it a try 
positive, We had been warned about slow service but booked a table for 20 00 about 45 minures beforehand they were able to fit us in The servie was fine and seemed a perfectly normal speed I feel the menu is slightly restricted but does cater for all I suggest it is worth a try and I never saw any slow service 
positive, My wife and I today visited the Walton Arms for Sunday lunch There are still a good selection of real ales although they no longer include the excellent Jennings beers that I used to enjoy We were also disappointed with the meals I the steak and kidney roly poly which I felt was too much suet pastry and too little meat whilst my wife had roast beef and Yorkshire pudding and had to leave all the beef because it was too tough to eat To be fair they did not charge us for the beef and the starters were excellent but nevertheless it was disappointing after anticipating the usual excellence However we will definitely give it another try before giving up on this restaurant which has been so good in the past 
positive, Had our 1st nights meal in The Ship food was very well cooked an well presented could have had vegetable options as my Wild Boar sausages and mash was very nice but didnt fill me up great selection of cider from the barrel and beers 
positive,I have now been to this restaurant four times and every visit has been a good experience The food is good especially the tagines and the meatballs and pleasantly different from the standard fare in other similarly priced restaurants in the area It is well placed for a pre-theatre meal 
positive, The food is average but plenty to choose from If you visit for lunch during the week it s a really bargain and surely worth it a try 
positive, My friend reccomended this place to me and i wasnt dissapointed There variety of food was great from mexican to sushi and even little burger Also the desert isle was to die for i went a bit over the top with the profiteroles  My only concern is the food wasnt piping hot like it had been out a while maybe turn the things that hold the food up a bit to keep the food warmer But it never put me off my food one bit  A very nice all you can eat 
positive, Good quality tradition chinese food but difficult to get access for wheelchairs or prams and decor is very dated Service can be done with a little improving also 
positive, Visited once for teas coffes and liked it so I came back The owner manager is very friendly Menu is authentic french service is smooth atmosphere is very relaxed Definitely recommend it 
positive, Had a great time here the food was great and I enjoyed the retro theme and friendly atmosphere My biggest criticism however is the price of the drinks  3- 4 for half a pint of beer is way too much 
positive, this is my second time eating in thai edge and I am impress Brilliant food atmosphere is great for friends gathering Service is great and fast Definitely will come back again  Keep it up Thai edge 
positive, Sound basic cafe friendly staff excellent breakfasts and good value Often call in here during lunch break 
positive, Our first experience at The Anchor and we will return The food was interesting well-cooked and presented and very tasty Total cost for two 3-course meals with a bottle of wine and a couple of pre-meal drinks was just over 100 The food quality was very good and the atmosphere it s a converted pub was convival Staff were helpful and attentive without being intrusive 
positive, Went to Chiquito for dinner with a bunch of friends before going out in Central London we had all different things from the Menu and everyone was happy with their meal We also had cocktails which were really nice as well Our waiter Ricardo was friendly and suggested his favorites dishes Definitely recommended if out and about in Central London and looking for nice Mexican food 
positive, Welcoming staff on a busy Tuesday evening looked after us very well Food was excellent - I had Guinea fowl - which arrived promptly and was a very attractive as well as tasty plate of food We will no doubt return 
positive,Friendly tasty burger and pleasant restaurant Staff were friendly and cheerful Good choice of dishes 
positive, A delightful pub in the beautiful county of Rutland The Horse & Jockey is a lovely country pub with a friendly atmosphere and plenty of outside seating in the sunshine The food is good quality and plentiful - you will want to have a walk around part of Rutland Water afterwards  Well worth a visit of you are in the area 
positive, the food is good and not to expensive the bar could do with extra staff but the beer larger and wines are fine the place is friendly clean and the staff try hard 
positive, Been here several times and had a good night on every occasion well kept ale fine and prompt service and good food 
positive, 1st visit to this pub even though live locally Good atmosphere food good value and tasty Staff very friendly Will definitely revisit 
positive, A wonderful experience from start to finish A short walk from the room down the amazing hotel staircase Service & food were top notch The wine list is extensive a lot of it seriously expensive However we found good wines within our range 
positive,We booked in for a pre Christmas Sunday lunch here a few weeks earlier and were disappointed when it appeared they d double booked our table which we had selected for my fathers access as he is unsteady on his feet  The place was packed and they appeared to have bitten off a bit more than they could chew that day Once the food arrived it was of a good quality and plentiful previously we had been served drinks at our table but I had to go to the bar myself on this occasion We will certainly visit again when it s hopefully a little less busy 
positive, We dropped in here with some friends on a lovely summers day Friendly welcome and service from the manager Jamie Took a table in the large beer garden Menu extensive all the usual pub favourites There was a mix up with our order but the wrongly delivered items were replaced with no hesitation This is a venue that you could well pass by since many people just leaving Highcliffe are probably only intent on getting to Bournemouth - worth looking out for on your next journey Evidently the pub has just been taken over - I only hope they don t change too much 
positive, Having lost the will to live with overpriced chains charging upwards of 3 50 for a coffe i popped into coffee culture one day and was most suprised A large coffee for 2 85 which tasted better and was the same size as a large at one of the major players  Pleased to see that it was clean a big bugbear of mine in eateries  had friendly staff and opens at reasonable and consistent hours  Will most definately visit again and try the cake and other cakes etc on offer 
positive, This is a nice restaurant offers a good variety of food all of which is well-presented and made using quality ingredients For the money and portion-size it s good value as well We sat on the ground floor which is undoubtedly more atmospheric and intimate and is recommended if you re out as a couple the upper floor is better for larger parties - though the restaurant feels better suited to small parties or couples anyway Staff were friendly helpful and attentive 
positive, We visited for lunch on Sunday and really enjoyed the food atmosphere and service we will definitely return 
positive, Nice local beers and friendly staff Great place to spend any wet days Traditional pub grub and the the young waiter was very professional Only negative would be that the food was too stacked on the plate but that is not a criticism 
positive, Great place for a quick breakfast Delicious big fat bacon butty on toasted brown bread Good coffee and tea Nice light cafe with views towards the waterside Big area for sitting outside too 
positive,We shared a Seafood selection and were not disappointed Lovely cod prawns calamari fishcakes and chips & dips Great value and nice staff 
positive, Had anice meal here this week There is a special midweek me€¤u that is very reasonable The wine and beer are a bit expensive but the food is fresh and very tasty 
positive, The restaurant has a modern but comfortable feel to it The quality and presentation of the food was mostly very good Quality not as good on second night of our stay I believed this was because they were catering for a large business barbecue Underused by guests in the evening 
positive, An impromptu meal at this restaurant was an excellent experience Staff polite and attentive and my partner was very impressed by her meal Mine was excellent too We ate early on a Friday so establishment was quite quiet They were doing lots of takeaway business with locals they obviously know what s good  
positive, This restaurant is a gem yet to be discovered by the trip advisor community It seems like the personnel is a bit unexperienced but making a good effort The dishes I ordered were quite good They also have a very nice selection of asian beers 
positive, Great surroundings food very good and great choice Prices are reasonable and great beers You must try it out 
positive, Having just moved to the area this is my second visit to the pub and can highly recommend the carvery and the drinks This is one of the few pubs in the area to sell Jail Ale and it was served well The wine was excellent too and not expensive The carvery was fantastic better than the Toby which was my favourite until eating here Good slices of quality meat and good choice of veggies to boot Okay it may be stuck in the 1980 s with dark pseudo-beams but there is a definite drive and willingness to change that This is a good local pub and will only survive if we locals and tourists support it Give it a try 
positive, 6 of us all had a good lunch here Reserved seated immediately Was very busy - Saturday afternoon Service was quick food all good and ate in full Personally didn t like the dressing on the salad not a fan of mustard  Little bit chilly every time door was opened - could do with an extra door to keep out the cold during winter months 6 lunches and drinks most of us had 2 only came to 54 Choice of sandwiches panini jacket potatoes etc an all serve with chunky potato chips which were nice 
positive,It was dark cold and raining in Newbury when I walked into Art of Siam Instantly I was cheered up although quiet there was still a reassuring hum of activity in the restaurant The service was good and the staff very attentive the wine was excellent and the food was to a very good standard Just what was needed on an dismal and dank evening in Newbury 
positive, I frequent the caf€÷ fairly regularly and on the whole it s an enjoyable experience By far the best Waitrose caf€÷ in Gloucestershire Sure it gets busy but what do you expect when most people are there for their free tea or coffee Reasonable selection of food and snacks and the staff are always helpful and friendly Only let down are the loos - they are in desperate need of refurbishment I avoid them completely these days 
positive, The range and quality of the food is unsurpassed anywhere for miles around Beautiful Jewel of a restaurant that is somewhat hidden by its first floor location  Not at all overpriced I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants food quality decent value food with a touch of class 
positive, Very pleasant with good food our 2 year old G daughter was well looked after as we all were  Enough of everything to eat in nice surroundings  Cost is very reasonable and the staff are polite and friendly 
positive, Good range of Italian food well prepared and competently cooked Main course A bit slow in arriving so would recommend allowing time for your visit Overall though a satisfying meal and would recommend 
positive, Had a romantic weekend away in Stratford and opted for El Greco because of the high trip advisor rating and because my good lady speaks Greek We opted for the Mezze menu The food was all lovely and certainly filling Service was a little slow but maybe being a busy Friday night its to be expected would we go back definitely - 
positive, I visited Tampopo in Reading for a workmates leaving do on a Friday evening and was generally pleased with this restaurant  We had a party of nine so were able to sit around one of the long tables so perhaps a round table would have been nicer  The food is moderately price which didn t really bother me this being a special occasion Although my choice of starter Gyoza wasn t available the tampura prawns I had instead were very tasty For my main course I went for Pho Xao Bo I had a fair crack at this noodle dish with the chopsticks but forks are on offer  The food was served quickly and everyone got what they d asked for first time The staff were friendly yet unintrusive One thing to note you will be offered prawn crackers on arrival  but these are charged  To sum up - this was worth the visit and this is an interesting concept - asian cuisine without leaning on the two big guns of Indian & Chinese 
positive,& is therefore very good indeed  Popped in on a Saturday for lunch Pretty quiet and a small buffet rather than ordering Food was all good hot in both senses and fresh  Tasted like Indian food I had eaten in India which is the name of the game - and let s face it all you can eat for 8 in London is a very good deal 
positive, Tucked away down an alley yard in Kendal-speak opposite their sister shop but well worth seeking out for breakfast through lunch to tea Successful fusion of English cafeteria with Middle-Eastern mezze Quietly veggie Vegetable soup was industrial-strength warming and filling Mezze are well-mixed and tasty Or you can have a bacon roll with ketchup Fine selection of delicious cakes to fill any crevices after a meal or just for tea 
positive, Visited the Tipu Sultan as knew it as the Jug previously and was curious to see what it had become  Very friendly staff inside nothing was too much trouble the decor was very nice and it was nice to see an open kitchen where you could see food being prepared The seating was okay we sat in a little booth which was quite comfortable  The staff were very nice and polite when we arrived it was fairly quiet and the staff were around but not overbearing leaving us to eat our meal in peace which I thought was a good balance of their roles  The selection of food available was vast as well as their drinks The food tasted good too  Well worth a visit if you are in the area 
positive, Very quiet pub 3 meals took a long time to arrive This did give us more time to enjoy the character and the beer which was served and kept well The food when it arrived was excellent  I was with 2 coeliacs who were very pleasantly surprised by both the menu and the quality of the food although my liver had been either over cooked or hot held while waiting for the fish Well the liver I was served anyway not my personal liver All in all a very pleasant pub as long as you don t go expecting chain pub serving speeds but you go to pubs to take it easy anyway right 
positive,We don t bother wandering about looking for which place to go now We ve been to Dean s a good few times and the food is what you would expect for a seaside fish n chip shop As good as Martellos was in Dymchuch years ago 
positive, I booked a table here for a group of 16 Rotary Club members for an early afternoon meal before going on to visit the House of Commons where we were to have a tour of the place  We were welcomed by the staff with a smile and the service we received was top quality The food that we ordered was really well prepared and very tasty There was a very good selection available on the menu and there was an added bonus that on a Monday there is a promotion for 50 off the cost of the food ordered  Every one of the 16 of us enjoyed the food and complemented the staff on the way that they looked after us considering that the restaurant was extremely busy 
positive, it was a surprice to find this pub off the beaten track  might have been a popular spot but we stumbled across it on a sunny sunday afternoon by chance beautiful beer garden lovely little pond and very countryside feel to the whole place Cant argue with the drink as it was cool and refreshing  was going to be  and the service very pleasant as the main arrived it had to be a roast and it was DEEEELICIOUS  the sweet was nothing to go wild over but it done the job required and 2 bottles of rose  RJOCA  went down well among the 4 of us  the biggest shock was the bill  120 pounds 4 people aperitifs  roast dinner and 2 bottles of rose and 2 desserts  dead cheap if you consider the quality  we must go again but don t forget to book if you want to sit inside  we didn t but it was hot and we grabbed a table outside  
positive, great to visit the shard and eat at aqua very good food good service but there was a long delay serving the main course one of those things to be sure wine is expensive 
positive,had three courses here with my partner menu read very well and the cooking of the individual elements was very nice I felt some of the dishes lacked balance though and perhaps needed a bit of tweaking to take this place up a notch 
positive,There is a certain amount of nostalgia about visiting this pub you many many years ago when it was owned by the Whitbread Brewery company my father was Mine Host and together with my mother they were the first to introduce Pub Grub to the area Increasing the choice of cold pork pies or a packet of crisps and a pickled egg  Of course the Weighbridge has undergone a few transformations since then and I m glad to see they now have a decent sized car park and a covered walkway to the toilets  I have no idea if the present owners are even aware of what I have written above but during my visit I was pleased to see that the tradition of serving good food has become something of a tradition  For first time visitors even although there are many delightful things on the menu a must try is one of their now famous 2 in 1 Pies of course according to my friend the freshly cooked fist and chips was also delicious  The entire experience was a treat doubly so because it was my turn to chose where we were going to eat that day 
positive, Nice quaint little cafe on one of the main streets in Cleckheaton Great service and friendly staff  Large menu with lots of choice from full English breakfast to sandwiches baguettes Jacket potatoes salads etc A very nice place to stop off for some breakfast lunch 
positive, had a fabulous meal last night at san remo food was very tasty hence the garlic and chilli heading excellent value for money  and very fast service in all great food and a good time 
positive, Went as a party of 12 altogether Food and service were fine and good value for money overall The service was excellent - thanks guys 
positive, Family outing for Sunday Lunch to celebrate at birthday Age range 15 to 80 We had drinks in the elegant bar before going into lunch Several interesting choices from the long gin list Interesting to note you get different tonics depending on your choice of gin We all ordered from the €˜ la carte menu and all had excellent meals Bit of a long wait for dessert as there was a problem with a panna cotta not setting so we got a complimentary dessert to share while we waited Not necessary but a nice thought  The Woodspeen is always good and this was no exception 
positive, Ticked all the boxes good food good choice good service and near the Sunborn where I was staying - good indian restaurant 
positive, The nook kindly opened for us in the off season Now you can bring alchohol into the premises however for us the food was more than adequate fantastic in fact without the need for a drink  Cosy restaurant with great food well recommended 
positive, attentive but discreet service no pressure to order and wine options by the glass vvg for lunchtime selecting 4 mini mains for 2 to share really good we had fish pasta salad etc all well presented staff v helpful  
positive, An unusual venue decorated with celebrity memorablia and providing cook you own steak on rocks experience Food was very good and the staff excellent 
positive, Service was great and the place has a very relaxed feel Food is good and by far the best I have had in Beckenham 
positive, I am quite new to gin so a gin tasting menu at the London Gin Club seemed like a thoughtful gift as an evening out Now I m from Somerset so when I think of London Clubs I foolishly think oil paintings leather chairs and a reluctance to accept women as members The London Gin Club is not one of those Clubs A small bar in an old pub with old enameled signs nailed to the walls and ceiling and a traditional wooden floor The gins were good the service equally good and enthusiastic and the venue packed full of cheery gin drinkers It was a fun experience just lacking in oil paintings 
positive,Nice food interesting wall art although you feel a bit of a plum staring past people to read it helpful staff it was the Saturday after Black Friday so was very busy  they put on a special birthday message and song on the big screen which was a nice touch  all in all very good 
positive, Coulsdon High Street aka the Brighton Road has its fair share of eateries La Scarpetta is outstanding its neighbour Sichuan Gardens is excellent too The former offers interesting pasta dishes pizzas and everything else you would expect all cooked and served to high standards The only drawback is acoustic sound voices and music can be distracting 
positive, Watchet is a sweet little town but the eating opportunities are quite limited The Spice Merchant rescues Watchet from gastro-oblivion We all enjoyed all the dishes and the portions are big This includes the starters so take care not to over-order Friendly guys running the show too 
positive, went there for the first time having seen the great reviews on this site  We haven t had Japenese in the UK before and both of us thought the food was wonderful The fish used in the Sashami was so fresh and and just a delight The teryaki was yummy to say the least Japenese food is not cheap but it is good value just for quality Thw waitress was very helpful and very nice girl My only niggle was that the main arrived before we finished the starters but it wasn t that big a deal 
positive,Quality ground beef nothing like the mass produced burgers you get elsewhere Very attentive service lovely atmosphere 
positive, Don t get me wrong this is a lovely  indeed fabulous  restaurant It just needs a few tweaks to make it outstanding Of course I m only speaking from my own experience so here goes  Sadly we got off on the wrong foot phoned to book and was told that the manager would call me back in about 10 minutes to take my booking The 10 minutes came and went but no call back Busy with other things on a work day I eventually called back two hours later to see what had happened - and was told that my booking had be logged after all Hmm  So the big night came and off my wife and I trotted Bombetta is immediately welcoming with a lovely warm bustling and friendly atmosphere and the air is full of delicious cooking smells The lighting is soft as is the Italian opera playing in the background and the d€÷cor is tasteful and balances modern and traditional successfully  As it was later in the evening and we were hungry we decided to order the main courses Bombette rather than share several small ones My wife ordered the chicken with Taleggio I ordered the pork with prosciutto Both were very good but mine was a little salty Also a little more bread to accompany the meal wouldn t go amiss However this aside both portions were plenty if you added a couple of sides  Italian wine was of course de rigueur I ordered a bottle of Fiano  but was told it was not available An Italian restaurant without Fiano The waitress who was always friendly and helpful without ever being intrusive recommended the next bottle down on the wine list This was unfamiliar to me but good It could have been a tad colder though We then shared a dark chocolate and hazelnut torte for dessert which was very satisfying with a distinct hazelnut flavour throughout  One fly in the ointment was the rather loud foursome we were sat next too Not only did they talk extremely loudly rather selfish in such an intimate space but their topics of conversation including one couple s daughter s diarrhoea were not pleasant to say the least I know this is not Bombetta s fault but perhaps the manager could have had a quiet word with them They were hardly inconspicuous  So overall a very very pleasant experience at Bombetta - just a few tweaks would make it outstanding I will certainly be back   
positive, Nice little Indian Restaurant just down a side street in the centre of Bowness on Windermere Great food and also includes a takeaway 
positive, Mid-afternoon lunch while waiting for flight connection in T3 LHR A good choice of food on offer & all at a reasonable price I had a Chorizo burger with a side of Chili Brocolli and a large drink for 17 Meal arrived timely and the waitress Tanya was friendly and professional Highly recommend this venue 
positive, As frequent visitors to London we stumbled across 28-50 when heading for The Union Cafe - and we are so glad we did Food outstanding staff helpful friendly and attentive Atmosphere just right for our leisurely lunch 
positive, Good for a coffee and has parking in the High Street which makes it a easy Good brunch menu if you re in the mood No dislikes 
positive, Greeted by friendly staff price was very reasonable and the food came right away  Got some patties to go for later and the drinks chiller is packed full of great and varied sodas juices punches etc   Oxtail rice and peas Mac n cheese and fried chicken   Chicken was hot and crispy came with a sauce but really didn t need it as it was full of juice Rice was perfectly cooked and the oxtail was rich gelatinous and full of flavour falling off the bone Mac n cheese was a bit overcooked but the flavour was spot on  The only thing I would change is the tropical sun hot sauce in favour for my usual encona hot pepper just personal taste tbh  Give this place a try as I ll be sure to come back next time I m in the area 
positive, We went out on a Saturday night There were 5 of us I was surprised that it wasn t busier for a Saturday night at 8pm It filled a little heading towards 9pm but there were still tables available for 2s and 4s  The food was nice and good sized portions too - I didn t feel I was being conned  The service was adequate but for a brand like Carluccio s I was expecting something a little more special 
positive, Food Brilliant Staff Brilliant went with avout 30 people for a birthday mean and every was served quickly and food was piping hot and tasted lovely it wasnt overly priced either as we went mid week when there was an offer on 
positive,Nice food good atmosphere friendly service all round nice place to eat and drink good value for money enjoy the buffet eat as much as you like 
positive, Unless you arrive shortly after opening expect to queue The fact regulars do just that is indictive of how popular this Italian venue is Expect a boisterous evening with laughter plenty of talk occasional singing of waiters serenading a birthday diner wafting smells of wonderful garlic and great food The portions are generous and not unduly expensive However no cards are accepted only cash I have been enjoying this venue and my 90 year old mother  for years 
positive, Our first visit Small but interesting menu- not pub grub Good cooking and decent portions We paid 28 for a two-course meal for 2 including a pint of lager and half of cider Friendly service Tip is not included We ll go again to try the evening menu Seems very popular and is worth a try 
positive, No quibbles about the location and views We turned up without a reservation and were cheerily accommodated after only fifteen minutes It was in term time and on a pretty dismal day so wouldn t try this at peak times The menu is a little pretentious fancy names in Italian or faux gastronome French disguise pretty average food albeit well presented and cooked Don t expect burger and chips and the catch of the day is going to be something you ve never heard of  The staff were pleasant patient and helpful The furniture is modern glossy and appropriate without being cafe naff Expect to see your bill to be inflated by charity donations and service charges They don t tell you this until you read all the stuff on the reverse of the menu All in the name of a good cause of course  One of those places to mark off your bucket list but probably not to repeat except to vist the beach 
positive, Arrived on a Sunday lunchtime only food was a roast lunch But a great welcome grand beer and food was value for money We enjoyed it and our dog was very happy Would go again 
positive,I have visited the cafe twice - both midweek lunchtimes The food was freshly prepared and tasty and the selection of cakes for afternoon tea was delicious We also received good service 
positive, Great little cafe in Chilwell brilliant and warm welcoming owner and staff Some of the best cakes you ve seen and tasted Great mix of drinks as well from coffee and tea to freshly made fruit drinks to the Choczilla a must try if they are still doing it  Food is nice my only little niggle and it s more because I m a fussy eater the food selection is limited I m not a fan of quiche so would like another option like toaties pannis or just a sandwich roll 
positive, We unexpectedly found ourselves in York on a wet Tuesday lunchtime feeling hungry Rather than visit one of our usual haunts we decided to try somewhere new We stumbled upon 1333 by accident but were delighted by our find We had the 2 course set menu which proved to be excellent and together with a bottle of house wine the bill came to just over 30 for the two of us great value  If I was looking for a negative I would have to say that the service was a little slow but we had plenty of time so it didn t matter  Well worth checking out 
positive, First of all the view from this branch of Thai Square is amazing It has large glass throughout the restaurant that you can see Putney Bridge and River Thames when you are dining  Secondary food was good We ordered seafood platter and some other starters Seafood was fresh staff said they get fresh lobster delivered everyday Personally not sure about the lobster but certainly their prawns squids were fresh and soft shell crabs were amazing Lobster was a little dry Didn t like their Tom Yum soup which taste sweet somehow Overall I will rate their food 3 8 if I can do that to 1 d p  Cocktail precisely measure mixer proportion and always taste same and great  Finally their service was good Attentive and polite But I can feel it could get slower towards peak time packed with people so baring that in mind gives your meal experience better  Overall I enjoyed I will come back 
positive, A very popular restaurant that serves great food and has friendly staff but i ordered a hake dish and got Cod i was a hake fisherman for 20 years so i know the difference this was disappointing as everything else was lovely 
positive, To be fair this place has always been one of the better options in Cannock for a good meal However it has the potential to be 5* Recent visit on Sunday afternoon wasn t to the usual high standard but appreciate it had probably been a busy day given the weather Love the little Forrest walk beside the Tavern and the grassed area outside Missing a simple activity for kids Even a tree stump would suffice Good food good beer great scenery 
positive, This place is the go-to chinese takeaway for my friends and I Very reasonably priced and has meal deals from 6 7  The food is great nothing to complain about there and the staff are very friendly They take card 50p surcharge if under 10 My only complaint is that they aren t open on Fridays 
positive, We tried carrot and coffee cakes and they were delicious and portions were big so I was really glad we chose that place Tea is served in pots with refills so it is good On the other hand coffee quality is average at the best They should be careful roasting coffee or get a better one Service was ok not very attentive so no tip was given 
positive, The staff were attentive upon arrival We were shown to our table as our party was 7  The waiter named George was very good although he was looking after a load of other guests and could have done with some help We had to wait a little as some of our party hadn t arrived he made sure we had enough drinks We ordered our food and when it arrived we had to wait as the bread was missing from the a starter The mains came and was ok The food was very good  We ordered some more drinks which took a while to come as they were busy hence need more staff Didn t order a sweet as we had a birthday cake which the lit and brought to the table  And the whole room sang happy birthday to our mum who was 89  We all said we would visit again Many thanks to the kitchen staff and cooks for a nice meal and to George for looking after us  Would advise to book  Enjoy we did  
positive, Food was perfect for a pre cinema meal Cooked fresh not a place for a whole evening out but nice enough 
positive, Simple french food and really affordable nothing pretentious here just simplicity and tasty food good address for french food lovers 
positive, Great find opposite The Premier Inn on Hanover St Liverpool 1 Ideal for breakfast our party of four was made very welcome and we had a nice meal The porridge is sensational and the full breakfast excellent value Lovely friendly & efficient staff We ll definitely be back  - 
positive, Visited Bluegrass with some other guests from a wedding party food was tasty and moorish probably not the healthiest place in town as I m sure I could feel my arteries complaining The menu was typical American bbq the usual chicken ribs burgers and fries not the best I ve tasted but great for what it is and where it is I would visit again if I was in the area 
positive, Five Guys is directly below a gym in Cambridge and after coming out of said gym and finding it bucketing down with rain I thought I may finally try Five Guys for lunch and find out for myself if what I had read was true I can say yes Yes It is pricey - I knew it would be although perhaps was surprised at just how expensive Yes The food thankfully is as good as billed The burger was excellent at 8 it should be  and came wrapped in tin foil - a touch which I liked The fries were superb - I had spicy Cajun which were hot and tasty and even in regular size the portion was more than generous There was an excellent choice of shakes - I went for cherry which was delicious The staff were friendly and polite which was nice too Downside apart from the price - a lack of trays and the tables weren t cleaned much as people left even though it wasn t busy at that time due to the weather  Overall I wouldn t go regularly not just because of the price  15 50 for burger fries and shake but also because it would defeat the purpose of going to the gym But as an occasional experience I definitely will call again 
positive, We stopped off here for dinner as we still had a few hours drive ahead of us  The restaurant has been refuted recently and looks very bight and modern  I ordered the haddock and chips which is cooked to order whilst the other half had the lasagne Both portion sizes were enormous and tasty and fresh  As I said   Surprisingly good 
positive, We rediscovered The Farmers Boy in late Summer 2010 it is now a fond favourite of ours each time that we visit family nearby in the village The quality of the food is spot on every time and the staff are fantastic a great combination to guarantee future visits 
positive, Nice open fronted restaurant with outside and inside seating Food was nicely presented with a good display of cakes and bites Wide choice of food including jacket potatoes and wraps Food was delivered quickly with a good amount of crunchy coleslaw and plenty of prawns Good hot coffe and very tasty flapjacks 
positive, Best to book for the restaurant they were very busy but tried hard to fit in all callers Food was very generous- we had lamb shank and steak and ale pie veg was not overcooked as is often the case  Had to share a pudding as feeling very full by that time The pub has good local beer - I liked the option of having 3 different types- each in a third pint pot We called in just for a drink on 3 nights and always felt very comfortable here 
positive, My family and I visited a few days ago and as soon as I walked in I found myself pleasantly surprised for the great welcoming atmosphere The service was impeccable and caring and the food very tasty We loved most of all the Thai Calamari and the King Prawns noodles 
positive, Love the fact that you bring your own booze The Indian food is good the place isn t exactly the most beautiful but it s fine for a curry night out with mates 
positive, Two lunches at this pub the first being a liquid lunch The second lunch on Sunday roast beef With the trimmings at 9 95 was delicious Helpful staff good outside are for the kids 
positive, We live in London and booked a table for eight people for a pre-theatre meal and were very impressed with the positive experience On a very warm evening 27c in late Sept there was a cool breeze through the restaurant Service was fast friendly and efficient and the Pre-Theatre Menu at 11 70 for two courses or 13 65 for three courses was extremely good value not least because the food exceeded expectations by a considerable margin Steak and chips was a much better steak than I expected and the chips were excellent Others said chicken and sea bass were also very good and the calimari were excellent Also the menu was pleasantly free of the language that sometimes afflicts this type of brasserie style restaurant ie hand-drizzled virgin oils with balsamic vinegars brewed by carefully selected Tuscan farmers etc 
positive, Visited on a regular basis over the years  standard and choice of food seems to have improved since we last visited  Word of caution  Sunday s can be a bit hectic because their carvery is very popular  So expect the service to be understandably a touch slower  
positive,Read the good reviews on TripAdvisor and thought this place had to be worth a try The reviews don t lie - tasty breakfast served on the biggest plate I ve ever seen Sausages and bacon were delicious and clearly well sourced everything cooked well and very friendly service 
positive, Went with a group of 9 ages fron1 to 85 easy to park and find a table Staff were helpful and sorted out the chairs for the youngsters  Some of us had the carvery which wes good had from the menu that also was very Google these tat has Te afters could not believe the huge portions Not high class food but very nice 
positive, We hadn t booked but managed to get squeezed in on what was clearly a busy night despite which the staff were friendly and helpful The atmosphere was very good a great clash of old English pub and bright Indian colours and fabrics and the food was excellent  both my starter and main were fresh tasty and well presented Only minor thing that let it down was my desert which was not very tiramisu-like at all 
positive, Jaipur Spice is a very sound choice for a curry  The menu was very broad and featured all the old favourites and many dishes I d not heard of  Food was good Tasty sauce and meat well cooked  I d go back 
positive, Enjoyed excellent quality food in this charming cafe The staff were friendly and the service was brisk  We particularly enjoyed the quirky mugs and furniture 
positive, This is a small bar with a area for sitting outside It is part of the station so if you want to leave it late before you get on your train or didn t enjoy your journey and need a drink this bar is ideally situated Because of this the bar can be quite busy and you pay a premium for its location  The bar is well stocked and the bar staff seem quite well trained  The decor is quite decadent with dark colours and leathers If you can find a table it is a nice place to spend some time 
positive,Whilst on a short break to Lincoln the pub was recommended to us for very good food We were not disappointed The premises were very cosy with an extensive menu and good service This year it was runner up in the taste of excellence competition run by Lincolnshire Life magazine  A visit is recommended if in the area
positive,Arranged to meet up with a friend for a catch up somewhere near us both and we decided on Ashiana Indian Restaurant Having driven past many times but never gone in Lovely restaurant and staff are very welcoming - left us to peruse the menus at our leisure and in no way felt hurried  Restaurant in nicely decorated spacious and laid out nicely Waiters were very helpful polite and courteous Food selection was as expected from an Indian Restaurant however they need to revisit their menu spelling - quite a lot of spelling mistakes on it we employ a copywriter if you want us to sort it out - bit of a sales plug there   Food was very tasty and enjoyable not over spiced - although garlic naan was a shade too dry But that is my taste  Overall  Location = Great Service = Great Food = Great Menu = As Expected - please sort your spellings out   Will be back again in the near future for more of your great food Thanks 
positive,Tucked away at the top end of Portobello Road a nice choice for informal eating and drinking The atmosphere is nice and relaxed and they were playing great music when we visited Pizzas seem very authentic Italian-style sides were all good as well although presentation could have been better - not really a big deal though Prices were reasonable for Notting Hill Good for couples with some nice small tables tucked into the window but plenty of space for bigger groups too 
positive, Whilst the Dog and Bear is basically a pub with accomodation it doesn t pretend to be anything else It is really annoying going to a pub that thinks it is a top restaurant and charges top restaurant prices without the service to go with Not the case at Dog & Bear Food was beautifully cooked service was excellent ambiance superb Price was very reasonable- less than 25 per head including wine A thoroughly pleasant evening 
positive, A nice welcome on a wet day in this traditional pub A good range of beers including a local brewery Although I didn t eat this time the food menu looks good 
positive, Good choice of food and beverages Catered well for latecomers from theatre with food being served till 11 45pm in the bar and some room service 24 7 Service little slow when busy 
positive, Newly refurbished Chapel in Dunster has been renovated into a light and attractive tea room offering a selection of teas coffee light lunches and cakes as well as selling affordably and reasonably priced art and craft items  The owners make it a friendly and welcoming environment and it offers something different from the other more traditional cafes in the village and i particularly enjoyed many an hour spent eating a brownie alongside with a cup of coffee while taking a sabbatical from work in Dunster I was particularly impressed with their willingness to improve their fayre and accomodate my partner by making gluten and dairy free cakes and bread Has wifi too  I wish Gareth and Jonny well in their new venture 
positive, Heard it had been re-branded so called in for a couple of drinks and a meal Not keen on being sat with ankle biters but they have a pleasant small section of tables for 2 Drinks very reasonably priced tried the Tetley Imperial which went down well Wife had the 12 oz Rump which was cooked perfectly to order I had the big Mixed Grill and thoroughly enjoyed it Food ordering point was a bit of a bottleneck only 1 till so the queue was a bit long luckily the front of house guy warned us that there were a few large bookings at the same time as us and advised us to order 10 mins earlier than planned Seemed like a new girl on the till so was a bit slow but hey everyone has to learn Staff were great going back at the weekend 
positive, I went for the 27 50 set menu with my family The portions were small-ish as expected and the food was mostly up to the standard All the sides and the starters were really nice I however couldn t finish my fillet steak I opted for as I m not a very big fan of anything else than meat i e connective tissue and other grotty bits  Also I was a bit disappointed with the waiting we had to do between meals and when asking for drinks The waiter forgot to bring us water we asked for so after 30 minutes of waiting we asked for it again as we were not sure if this was part of the normal waiting or just being forgotten about again The Chelsea Steakhouse feels a bit cramped but the decor and overall ambience is nice The service received was nice as well eventually when we got it I d probably not go there again but wouldn t advise against it either 
positive, First visit to York and the boys on the counter were friendly and interesting to talk to while we waited for our cod n chips Food was as good as it can get Would absolutely recommend both the food and good company 
positive, Great service and selection of dishes You will feel welcome from the very first moment  The food is good and lands in your table within a reasonable amount of time Did I say the service is great Well I mean it 
positive, Great for a mini celebration - we opted for a Lobster with salad and Champagne offer which was lovely and very reasonably priced Very popular and could feel a little cramped at times Staff were very attentive without being intrusive and service was just right The price of wine by the glass was rather steep though which meant we didn t stay for drinks and dessert afterwards There is clearly a balance to be struck between the offer and other items on the menus 
positive, Accomodated 16 of us on a busy evening Lots of choice and plenty for the kids as well Food and drink excellent but service a bit slow as it was busy and we were a large group 
positive, Proper old school pub but with a moderm twist Loved the decor very art deco meets the shining merts titanic  Good choice of drinks and good service  
positive, The three of us ate here before seeing Hamlet Excellent and worth seeing  Food was very good and the service was attentive and helpful Only slight issuette we were not given a window seat and were told that these were allocated on a first come first served basis When we arrived there were a number of tables empty but we couldn t have one  I used a booking app to get the table and there was no option for getting the window seat Small thing though otherwise good 
positive, Having decided to do a roadtrip into Lincolnshire I decided to base myself at Kirton in Lindsey as it was convenient for the area I would be exploring I also needed a place to stay at and chose The George  I was not disappointed The staff were very helpful and polite The en-suite room which was spotless on arrival was well furnished and very comfortable Although I was out during the day the cooked breakfasts in the mornings were very good as were the evening meals and I never had to wait too long for any of the food Also the fact that I did some late-night socialising with fellow members of a car owners group meant that the fact I could come and go as I pleased was a bonus Overall a very nice B&B and bar  restaurant in a nice village in Lincolnshire that I would certainly consider staying at and eating at again in the future if the chance came my way 
positive, Cotto is run and cooked for by Schweitzer the chef who founded the more famous Midsummer House now with two Michelin stars  The food in my view is better than Midsummer House The restaurant opens only for dinner Wednesdays to Saturdays You pay 60 for a three-course set meal  65 on Saturdays  Each course is beautifully imagined and executed for example to begin a pheasant breast served with winter vegetables in a vegetable soup or a herb risotto teamed with scallops in a delicate foamy sauce My main course included two sorts of pork cheek and fillet each perfectly cooked with various accompaniments and a sauce generously flavoured with truffle For the final course one cannot do better than try the chef s chocolates which are several classes above anything else one will ever sample The setting of the restaurant is undemonstrative but pleasant - though a bit stuffy if the evening is hot and the room is full The service when we went two years ago was in my view too laid back but a fortnight ago it was excellent - friendly but efficient and polite Why not five stars then The wine list is the biggest drawback The restaurant seems uninterested in wines and it offers a series of very ordinary bottles at extraordinary prices - 40 for a bottle that would cost you 8 in a supermarket but which if you had sense you wouldn t choose there You would need to pay about 60 - 80 to buy anything decent and even then the bottles on offer which we didn t taste at these prices are too young and not distinguished With one of the cheaper wines and coffee and adding something for service one should expect to pay 80-90 per head So a place for the rich or for very special occasions and when one is willing to concentrate on the food - which is as good as almost anywhere I have eaten even in France - and forget about the wine 
positive, We ve been to Esteban several times for family birthdays our two daughters love it We always receive a warm welcome the waiting on staff can t do enough to help 
positive,Staying overnight in town I just fancied a curry This was the Nearest to the hotel but absolutely hit the spot Service was friendly and efficient The food was well spiced and tasty 
positive,Went on the Saturday before Valantines day As always the staff were very friendly  We had the pressed rabbit and the pate off the specials board as starters  We both wanted something simple so I choose the burger and my wife choose the steak and kidney pie  Slightly disappointed that the pie did not come with potato s which were extra as both meal s were just a little too expensive for what we got  No complaints about the quality though 
positive,We stayed in West Lulworth for a week in August 2013 and ate here 4 times It was interesting trying the cider but after about 6 different ciders I realised actually I ve never liked cider so I went back on the beer I think I had 4 different meals and each one was good All the family including two teenagers enjoyed the food and we are all vegetarians The staff were very friendly and could not have done more for us The food took longer that I expected but that gave us a chance to catch up on emails and Facebook with the free wi-if Nice to have dogs welcome but at no time did any of them get in the way 
positive, Another good meal at Marco Polo however we would have liked it more if the bread had been free and the limoncello wasn t 
positive, Myself and 4 friends visited The Flying Fox on Saturday for a social catch up It s clear to see the pub has recently had a face lift as things looked very different from the last time we came in a positive fashion However the menu was still the same and I m getting rather bored of the same pies and beers on the menu  Our waitress was lovely and very attentive but our favourite waiter seems to have left the pub which we are gutted about Flying fox hold on to the good ones  My friends and I look forward to heading back soon for hopefully another lovely time 
positive, Nice country pub with helpful staff in the heart of Witlshire Children and dogs welcomed We ordered food as soon as the restaurant opened but despite this the food was great 
positive,Beautifully laid out Really well considered product & produce Lunch it s self was simple great value well presented and tasty The staff were equally as well considered well presented and very welcoming Loved it Will be back
positive, Food was great nice strong taste and for a tapas restaurant the portion sizes were generous Only thing was it was noisy too loud to talk the place had been designed without giving any thought to sound absorption 
positive, Had hoped to go to our usual choice but found they had run out of Sunday Roast had been walking past when we noticed the Cat was open for food wow spot on Sunday dinner with full flavour will visit again next time as first choice excellent all round Yet another bonus nice friendly service 
positive, Went for lunch last Sunday and by the number of people present thought this a good sign  We plumped for the carvery and were not disappointed A good choice of meats and vegetables I chose the beef and pork both cooked just right my wife the turkey which she said was perfect The vegetables were on the firm side which is much better than being over cooked Altogether a pleasant meal in a friendly busy restaurant 
positive, Apologies for the cliched title but this tapas bar cocked down the far end of Columbia Road in Shoreditch really does qualify as a hidden gem So many tapas bars in London churn out the same old microwaved rubbish it isn t true but at Laxeiro the food is freshly cooked on site and seldom do any of the dishes disappoint in terms of quality There s nothing particularly out of the order on the menu and the place itself has the feel of a cafe but the food is what defines it It s excellent and well worth a visit Probably best to avoid when the flower market s open cos it ll be heaving 
positive, Fantastic food company service and location The staff were efficient and the beer was good and a very pleasant evening was had by all 
positive, We have tried several cafes in Skipton with mixed results This one is the only one we feel inclined to return to again The food was lovely the decor bright and the staff friendly and helpful The menu choice was quite good and the tea plentiful The only reason I haven t given a five out of five is because another smalll group of customers had a very long wait for their food something other reviewers have noted I would definitely recommend a visit for their full English breakfast 
positive, We decided to try Kin Dee after another restaurant was full I m very glad we did  We were there quite early in the evening so the restaurant was quite quiet inside The decor was clean and tidy if not spectacular and background music inoffensive Table staff were very welcoming  Our meal consisted of tom kha gai calamari jungle curry and one other i can t remember the name of  they were all delicious chilli and spices were well balanced and definitely had the flavours of Thailand  Its been a while since I ve posted a review but i feel this place deserves some recognition for serving such delicious food which I felt was authentic and good value for money We ll be back 
positive, After having recently got back from the Caribbean I was missing the food so chose here during a visit to Bristol I d pre-booked a table as I d heard it was almost essential due to the place being so popular It was certainly packed when we went there This was done by filling in a simple form on their website and they call back to confirm The service was quick friendly and accurate and the food spot on If you want to dine early you also have the advantage of 2 for 1 cocktails between 6pm and 7pm  All in a very enjoyable visit though the bill was more eye-watering than the sauce  Keep an eye on your tally and you ll have a good night 
positive, Me and my family came here for my brothers birthday and had a very enjoyable experience  For an all you can eat  the food was very good quality very nice and the staff were also very friendly and nice  Couldn t ask for much more really 
positive, Well worth seeking out Authentic fresh and tasty italian food Reasonably priced in a nice atmosphere All pizzas pasta and meat dishes we have tried are top notch Gets regular return visits from many of the locals like us which is always a good sign  If you are in the area and in the mood for italian food then sizzlers is a great choice 
positive, Went here Friday and I was very impressed  I normally find buffets tacky rushed and canteeny so I was looking forward to seeing what this place was like As a buffet but order 2 table rather than the usual aroma east kind of places  Its around 15 for as much as you can want to eat the choice for starters was very good the usual prawn toast amazing aromactic duck won tons calamri  BBQ Ribs and seaweed etc we pretty much ordered everything get your moneys worth  There was 7 of us and we had plenty between us we even ordered more   The mains were to pretty decent good choice of chicken duck pork and beef dishes Can easily get bloated here Maybe the mains could do with a few more unique dishes I would say though  The desert was pretty average though just bland vanilla ice cream with NO SYROP  would of preferred a bit of choice on the deserts and some strawberry sauce  Drinks are good usual tiger etc shame not a Chinese beer on tap mind  However only disappoint I would say was they way they served the JAGER  not right and not cheap either  Overall I would definitely recommend this place if want a good choice of Chinese food and a reasonable price staff are nice to 
positive, We popped in for lunch on a rainy day Found thus delightful cafe on TripAdvisor Ranked one if the best cafs in Brighton Lived up to the reviews We had delicious wraps   tasty fresh unusual and healthy Couldn t recommend it enough  Lovely staff Good coffee Helpful at every turn You have to go and enjoy
