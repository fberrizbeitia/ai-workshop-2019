negative;I decided to try the Ark Fish Restaurant as whenever I pass it is always very busy I now realise this is due to how slow the staff are On arrival a rather unfriendly member of staff threw some menus at us and walked off After waiting for almost half an hour we eventually were able to order The staff were very unhelpful and did not give any wine food recomendations when asked I ordered a prawn cocktail starter which tasted off I decided not to eat it as was concerned about becoming ill During this period we had asked three times if our drinks were coming When I eventually received my wine it was in a dirty glass and tasted vile Again we waited and waited for our mains to be brought over The main was edible at best The atmosphere was like that of a school canteen and we were so desperate to leave we asked for our bill and decided against risking a dessert The bill arrived and had a number of items on there which we had ordered and not received I explained this to the waiter who tutted and took the bill to resolve the issue The food came to and was nowhere near as nice as Wood Fish and Chip shop along the road I would never return to The Ark and I genuinley believe that it was the worst restaurant I have been to
negative; After our first visit we have been advised to reserve in advance to ensure to have a table next time what we have done The welcome was pretty dull as usual it looks like from the person in charge the one owning the place I guess  but at the time I decided to ignore that fact in order to enjoy fully the experience there  The restaurant s dÇ¸cor is like a Japanese izakaya except I think for the single double tables at the counter having no view on the people preparing the food for you instead as the seats are side by side you ll face the entire time a big piece of wood not that great settings to tell you the truth  But I decided to ignore that too  The food was OK the quality of the sake was really good and served in nice original authentic sake bottle The waitress was nice friendly smiley and everything was going fine until we have been ASK TO LEAVE by the manageress within minutes when we were still eating our main course saying the table was booked for in minutes What a shock  First of all at no time we have been informed of this when we booked in advance and when I explained to her this it looks like she couldn t be bothered as long as we were gone in Without mentioning that even if we wanted to have some more food or a desert or more drinks anyway we had to go in  I have done many restaurant all over the world at different sort of price and all type of customer service but this is the first time in my life I have been treated so poorly as a customer From that restaurant advertising outside their doors that they are in the Michelin book they are just mentioned in it I would have never expected such a DISGUTING CUSTOMER SERVICE like that  I think that is a disgrace and It is very wrong to ask guests to leave when they are still eating However if they plan at a certain point to KICK customers OUT for other reservations they should at least inform them in advance and not letting them know minutes before the next reservation  People around me hearing about this were not impressed by this and though the same My Japanese friend who recommended me that restaurant was actually embarrassed for doing so and agreed that it was quite wrong  Obviously after this disappointment if it s what we should expect from the restaurant owner or management I would not recommend it to anybody and will not return again 
negative; I walked in and immediately walked out the smell was disgusting We just wanted a quick drink whilst waiting for our table in a nearby restaurant but unfortunately I was unable to stand the smell 
negative; of us visited this restaurant yesterday Had to ask for table to be cleaned  although place was not busy Had to ask about the steaks wine meal as it was not advertised in the venue Mother in law ordered sirloin steak Meal deal and wine when it eventually arrived was stone cold and Mother in law s steak inedible mainly gristle and fat for which she demanded a refund No one came to ask if food was satisfactory We have an excellent Chef and Brewer close to where we live in Northampton so expected a similar standard Staff look demoralised and would suggest a change of leadership as there must be good reason why other restaurants in Ruislip are are full to overflowing whilst The Swan and Bottle is almost empty on a Saturday lunchtime Will not be returning 
negative; I went here with friends on Saturday and had an awful experience The food was either tasteless too hot or wrong They got the orders wrong and an hours wait but the place was empty When we asked to see the manager he was rude aggresive and ever ripped up food in front of us We were made to feel very uncomfortable and were then charged for it completely wasted on bad food and bad service We will never go back there Stay away 
negative;Food was bloody awful dry and over corked the menu used to be wonderful and food about yrs ago now well you better of in a fast food place 
negative; We arrived at and was told it ll be a minute wait despite there being more empty tables than occupied After we were finally seated we waited a further minutes to have our order taken When the food arrived it was cold but as we d waited so long we were hungry and ate some of it we wasn t asked once if our meals were ok something I find surprising from a resturant We then waited another minutes after we d finished eating for our plates to be taken away even though the waitress had looked over numerous times and others that finished after us had been cleared away and paid their bill After being given the receipt we waited a further minutes to pay and leave I believe we could have easily left without paying as they seemed not to care if we were even here I m not one to complain on trip advisor quite the opposite as I believe good service should be recognised but being in a resturant for and a half hours for one course is diabolical 
negative; We have been visiting the hare and tortoise since it opened and it has always provided excellent food great service and good value for money We often visited the pub for special occasions birthdays anniversaries etc as you could guarantee an enjoyable evening  Not anymore Ever since the pub changed management in January it is like a different place they are forever running out of food or if you go for sunday lunch you are expected to wait at least minutes for your dinner and then when the food finally arrives it is always cold  The service is appalling there is lots if new staff and they are mostly all rude and impolite the prices have gone up and the portions sizes are noticeably smaller We went last Sunday for lunch to give the place one last shot after a few recent bad experiences after waiting about minutes for our dinner we asked the manager how much longer it was going to be due to my elderly grandma beginning to feel unwell as she is diabetic and has to eat regularly the manager then snapped at us and said she didn t want us in her pub anymore as we are rude and complain a lot when I commented that we wouldn t have to complain if it was up to scratch she replied that we only like it when we get things for free She then asked us to leave and said she would cancel our order I have never been spoken to in such a way especially in a pub full of people in my whole life We are taking things further and hopefully this unwelcoming rude inexperienced manager won t be at the hare and tortoise for much longer and it can return to being the great pub it once was Bring back pat 
negative; Have tried this pub on several occasions A very pretty pub lovely location However after having been on the receiving end of a very stroppy young lady s attitude on several occasions we gave up When I complained I was told she lived in the village  I did note with interest she was on her best behaviour when the manager was in Staff were more interested in serving the locals no interaction with other members of the public Overall felt very uncomfortable 
negative; Awful service waited over hr due to staff unable to do their job properly messed food order up altogether then when it arrived we were served with cold food needless to say will never visit this place ever again very disappointed please dont waste your money 
negative; We called in after a great day out  eventually found a clean table The place was filthy we thought we would give it a chance What a mistake Two of the party ordered chicken tikka massalla and the poppadums had been grilled instead of deep fried and were burnt The waitress knew and quickly got some more I ordered a oz sirloin medium rare with a peppercorn sauce the steak was black on one side and my sauce became Diane sauce We ate our food and left we really didn t want a dessert My advice is don t do it The manager and the chef seriously need replacing Take heed hungry horse 
negative; worse place ever eaten cold food dirty looking staff landlord big headed and you better not complain about anything  and the worse john smiths iv ever tasted at top price too decor way out of date A PUB ON ITS LAST LEGS searching for scraps dont be one 
negative; Ordered food they said minutes on a Thursday at pm over an hour came and went so I called to see where the food was he said it s still on the grill then tried blaming traffic for the delay I asked how can it b the traffic when it s still on the grill and he put the phone down on me Very rude customer service and a loss of custom We ended up using the kebab opposite And it tastes better 
negative; I had high hopes for our trip to Browns in Oxford having not been for years On entering my friend and I were welcomed by a sultry hostess who showed us to a table as we walked across the Wooden floor it became apparent the floor was ridiculously greasy and slippy having seated us she walked off no smile no offer of a drink We actually moved tables ourselves as the place was empty and there were far better tables available We finally got someone s attention and ordered a bottle of wine and a jug of water Wine came no water and no order taken After minutes another waitress came and took our order I mentioned the lethal floor and she said quot yes I know this it s greasy quot Food came still no water asked separate people for the water which finally came at the end of our meal The food was actually okay which was a relief  Once we had paid the bill we both went to the ladies walking VERY carefully not to slip over We were disgusted every single one of the ladies toilets was blocked were to the brim with excrement and the other with urine toilet roll all over the floor At this point I actually spoke to the manager who had no clue I mentioned the toilets should be regularly checked and are a reflection of the standard of hygiene in the entire place He was polite but clearly didn t care  Such as shame we both grew up going to Browns when it was privately owned it s part of a chain now and literally gone down the toilet  if it wasn t blocked  
negative; I ve been here before and it was amazing  Unfortunately things have gone downhill since our last visit I had a steak which was ok but the chips were horrible not helped in anyway by the metal pot they were served in which made them soggy My husband had a burger called a juicy Lucy burger well it s was so dry it crumbled on to his plate when he cut it He said it was disgusting and while we were discussing our poor meal I over heard another customer complaining about her burger and chips and left with out paying We told the staff about or food which we were not charged for It s a shame as when it first opened it was lovely Don t think I d ever go back 
negative; disgusting service disgusting food unless you like everything sweet Took over an hour to get our starters  minutes for refill drinks and out of of us had luke warm food whilst another was sat waiting  i had to go and ask to get it sorted whereup our waitress i use the word loosely had to take the order again food came minutes later All the meat was sweet gt gt gt gt gt why Poor service disgusting food and as it was a tuesday it was empty  dont go there save your money and go to macdonalds at least your fods hot there 
negative;Googled this place after watching Mary Berry Cooks and thought what a lovely looking place Found it read the menu and booked for the following Sunday On arrival we were very impressed old style pub but with new and contemporary fixtures My husband and I both ordered mushroom soup with was utterly tasteless It was luke warm and that thick you could have spread it Then the mains I order slow cooked lamb Anything but slow cooked in my opinion Slow cooked meat should fall off the bone  this you had to get a steak knife to get through it Other half had beef and this again was tasteless I am honestly not exaggerating it was all terrible Service was poor long time between courses Waitresses standing around discussing last nights events etc etc you get the picture One couple behind were waiting mins for dessert We felt utterly disappointed by the whole experience and would never return or recommend to anyone 
negative;Went to Yak and Yeti last night Restaurant was shabby and is in need of refurbishment Two of the bottles of wine we tried to order from the wine list were out of stock so settled on a bottle of Matues Staff bought wine to table and poured two glasses When she left we realised it was not Matues but a bottle of similar Sainsbury wine which you can buy for Wanted to charge us Was told that the wrong bottle was picked up Wouldn t recommend this restaurant at all as there was no heating on and was freezing cold couldn t wait to get home in the warm 
negative; When we arrived the restaurant was packed with Chinese people which is usually a good sign I was with a designer friend of mine and she had chosen the restaurant We ordered the food and it came quite quickly The vegetable spring rolls were only just ok and the other starter the same We kept looking at each other I didn t want to say it was awful as she had chosen the restaurant and as it turned out later she didn t want to say it was awful for the same reason The main courses came and they were just terrible Vegetarian Singapore noodles first time ever I had these and they were tasteless Sweet and sour vegetables which looked like they were swimming in an orange liquid Greasy prawn crackers The other dish of lamb was rubbery no jokes please and the fried rice was literally grey with black swipes in it I tried a bit of it and it tasted like old grease At the point we looked at each other and both said at the same time This is awful We called the waiter over told him the food was awful asked him to speak to the manager which he did and came back with some orange and a couple of lychees He was very nice it wasn t his fault We went to pay and speak to the Manager We told him the food was really really bad and we d left most of it We also couldn t evaluate the bill as it was all in Chinese and he did not suggest lowering it so we paid up  and left A lot of money considering there was only Chinese tea involved to drink which incidentally was also horrible dishwater Strangely enough everyone else s food looked quite good nice white rice etc so maybe we were singled out for special treatment If I were paranoid I would believe that We will never ever be going back there again or recommending it to anyone Don t risk it  ever 
negative; Went last Friday with a friend with the intention to dine however after the excessive unpleasant attitude and rudeness from one of the waitresses completely unwarranted we walked out before ordering after notifying the Manageress who apologised and recommended we eat in the bar instead as we refused to stay in the restaurant  The bar staff on the otherhand were really helpful and friendly before we entered the restaurant and after However after drinks due in part to the previous experence we went elsewhere to eat 
negative; Went to this restaurant for a group meal Initially it was to be a buffet but because there were too few bookings + were actually there  we were palmed off with a plated starter which was quite nice main courses to share including rice pancake and bread and a rice pudding for dessert Very little of the food was to my personal liking but I also heard a lot of the group uttering their disappointment too The portions were very small and most were only lukewarm I can certainly think of many better Indian style restaurants who give far better value for money We also had to wait quite a while for drinks After reading other people s reviews I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant  I won t be going there again By the way  don t even think of using the toilets upstairs disgusting 
negative; The decor was fantastic I arrived for the first time at the cozy club I was told by a jumped up year old that if I only wanted a light snack and a glass of wine that I had to sit outside My mum had has just got over an illness and very inappropriate to be sat outside in the rain I was so disgusted I left to go to a friendlier bar  Will never return Staff very rude x 
negative; I went here for lunch with my partner for my birthday having walked passed a few times and read good things However my experience here means I will never walk through the door again  We ordered with good time considering we had met on a work lunch break we were hoping to have eaten and be back in good time Turns out we waited  minutes for our meals two burgers and chips to arrive by then we had to leave When we ordered we were not told how long we would have to wait and those that came in after us for takeaway left before us  The biggest worry is that anyone is allowed to walk straight into the kitchen from the outside I was told to grab my own drink from the fridge behind the counter and two staff members rolled in off the street and into the kitchen to prepare food Without even washing their hands or changing their clothes Disgusting  When we asked for our money back there was confusion as the member of staff serving did not speak very good English and went to get the manager  Guess what she never came over I eventually took my food away in a takeaway box and ended up throwing it away I couldn t stand the thought of eating it after what I d seen  Clearly a place that just seems to serve friends and family of the owner and outsiders are clearly not welcome Will never return 
negative; A Long wait and when the meals had arrived they had for sure been microwaved Bar staff clearly didn t know how to smile and looked like they didn t want to be there Waiters standing around chatting and our waitress didn t have a clue what she was doing Will definitely not be returning 
negative; I have been to this bar a few times now and each time have been thoroughly disappointed with the service I and others have received from the staff there Tonight was so awful that I was compelled to write this review They called last orders at around :pm and then about ten minutes later went about telling everyone to get up and leave This was done in an extremely aggressive manner by one member of staff in particular He seemed furious that we hadn t finished up our drinks in the ten minutes we were given He angrily snatched away our glasses almost hitting me on the head in the process As soon as we d stood up our chairs were whipped out from beaneath us and stacked up  I ve never been to a pub with such awful and aggressive quot chucking out quot times There was no need whatsoever The food is probably nice and the atmosphere is okay but the poor service detracts from this somewhat  Next time I will definitely be trying out the newly opened Alfred across the road 
negative; Lovely place Called for Sunday lunch Waitress never raised a smile Food terrible Vegetables almost raw and carrots had a strange plastic taste Could have soled your boots with the Yorkshire pudding Not sure if mash was real or packet Came covered in gravy so no choice Roast beef not very nice either We left still hungry Definitely would not go again 
negative;I would like to give a review of quot The Dining Room quot as it was recommended to me However I booked on th October for a family group of to enjoy joint birthday celebrations at pm on th Today th October I have had a phone call from the dining room to cancel my booking as quot the kithcen isn t open that late quot After checking on website I find that no kitchen isn t open all day however they ARE open from pm Did they offer a later booking NO yet it would have been acceptable It did sound like a very young and lacking in customer service experience I am now having to find a new venue for at much shorter notice So really NOT happy 
negative; there were a number of flies in the restaurant before ordering our meal we drew this to the attention of the deputy manager who lit a number of citronella candles to help during our meal the flies began to land on our food whilst the deputy manager was very sympathetic the owner was not and told the manager to inform us that we were by a canal and should expect flies he also said that as we had eaten roughly half our food we should pay half for it he didnt even have the decency to address the complaint himself advise to stay away not a nice owner very rude although the rest of the staff were lovely ive eaten in lots of country pubs and pubs by the canal  none have had fliesin them  very worrying 
negative;I popped into this establishment on a hot summers day for a cooling ice cream I was astounded that for a small one scoop ice cream I was charged I paid out of politeness but honestly really how can they charge that much 
negative; When a chef won t eat in her own restaurant what does that say  Our visit on th December was a disaster When we arrived they told us there might be a delay as everyone was booked in for the same time  I ordered sparkling water to drink It was from a large bottle as they had no small bottles It had been open for about a week I think as the sparkle had certainly left I ordered a curry and again was warned there would be a wait There was indeed we waited hour minutes and when it came it was inedible The sauce was like water and so spiced it had no flavour just heat We were told they had had a run on curry so the chef had made some more and that was why it was so tasteless Another customer had been told that the chef doesn t eat curry so she didn t know how much spice to use We were not charged for this curry and the bar staff were very nice I don t know how they could stay so cheerful in the circumstances  The place was freezing and very dingy Desperately in need of some tlc Will definitely never visit this place again 
negative; We had a year old vegetarian in our party when i asked if there was an alternative option to pasta i was told no as the jackets were OOS We then had to wait mins for our food We then tried to order our desserts to be told that the ice cream was not available if we had known this when we arrived we would never have chosen to stay as the ice cream sundaes are by far the best thing they offer and the rest of their food is below standard They also had no butter available only very bad tasting margarine and myself and my partner received approx chips each on our gourmet burger dishes 
negative; Went for Xmas dinner total shambles from the start  We were asked to arrive at but were kept outside in the freezing cold for minutes  Had to wait nearly an hour from first course to main course  So many people were complaining that they hadn t even got there starter  For pounds we expected good food and good service but got neither  We decided to leave after our second course wasn t worth all the stress  Definatly won t recommend it to any one  
negative; We loved going there before However this is are third time going since it s a hungry horse and its shocking Service leaves a lot to be said and the food has gone down We went tonight and the things described on American platter were not on there We said to person taking our plates about it bear in mind no one had come to ask if our meal was ok  She aid she would tell manager and come back  ok we waited for ages then decided to leave on the way out the waitress who took our plates Wales passed us chewing food Seriously not good 
negative; We popped in after finishing a lovely walk visiting the area and my husband opted for a cream tea It was described as being offered with tea or coffee My husband said he would like a cappuccino instead of coffee this was on the menu as a coffee they served but he was told he could not have it Only tea or coffee the Japanese man said My husband said he wanted a cappuccino and the host said it would be more expensive That s fine we said The host couldn t let it go and started talking processes At this point we felt he didn t really want our business so said we may go elsewhere he said that s fine and picked up the grubby menus and that was the end of our visit We couldn t believe it we were not made to feel welcome and he clearly did not want to please us by giving us what we wanted  It s only afterwards looking on here that we realised we were not the first that have encountered his appalling attitude to customers I guess it is in a place with lots of first time visitors  if he was in a normal village he would be out of business by now  My advice there is a much more friendly and lovely tea room just down the road 
negative; Thought we had gone back to the s  not in a good way Awful entertainment and very dated furnishings 
negative; My family visited this pub during our week s holiday to Hayle with the intention of having our first evening meal together My mother  I went ahead to check there was space available for our party  Upon enquiry we were informed the pub doesn t serve food on Mondays This would have been fine with us had the gentleman behind the bar not delivered this message in such a rude and abrupt manner He s lucky I was in a good mood due to being on holiday or he wouldn t have got away with speaking to us like he did and extra lucky my father wasn t there to witness this exchange or there would have been trouble  I can appreciate that perhaps this gentleman may grow tired of repeating to customers that food is not served on Mondays but it s all in the delivery of the message  Service skills nil people skills nil  a poor representative of a beautiful town 
negative; We have been customers of Cosmos since they first opened in Chatham and we have always found the food and service to be nothing less than % every time We have always told friends how good it is to eat here and we have had many celebrations at this resturant as well over the years Last night we went in for a meal we can see they are having a refit no problem with that but no one wanted to serve us one of the ladies was wiping tables so I asked her if we could have some drinks the look said it all she was NOT please that we had bothered her when she came back she thumped the glasses of drinks on our table and never spoke a word to us That was it for us at that point we decided to leave we did speak to staff as we left but they was not really bothered We did tell them that we would not be returning to Cosmo again in the future 
negative; You would probably be better calling in at your local fish and chip shop The experience was outstanding Joy our guide waitress was fab reception was fab but if you are looking for a gourmet experience look elsewhere Worth it for the experience although it did get a little tiresome but not for the food itself I ve just arrived home and enjoyed CHIPS from the chip shop sorry if that sounds a bit naf  
negative; We have just returned from the worst sunday lunch I think I have ever had The building is beautiful but once inside the hall smelt of old fish The whole experience was like eating school dinners within an old peoples home We ordered drinks at our table and gin and tonics arrived without ice or lemon A long blond hair accompanied my husbands starter a piece of plastic in my daughters The waitress dropped a knife on my husbands shirt clearing away the starter We sat in a room which resembled a large library The tables were like the put up and down wall papering ones and function chairs Cheap and nasty china Three of us had pork two slices of very dry meat with a small dried out stuffing ball sitting on the top and one had turkey which didn t look much better Potatoes roast and boiled still with the water in cabbage about four beans and unpeeled carrots all came in the same dish No wonder everything was watery It is such a shame as the building and grounds are lovely and we had hoped the experience and food would live up to the surroundings It felt very much like people were on cheap breaks  the soup was out on trestle tables in large catering urns This could be good if someone could sort it out but changing the chef would be my first suggestion We are local but will not be returning 
negative; My first trip to stratford with my boyfriend was ruined by being turned away from this pub by an eastern european member of staff We followed a polish couple in who hadnt reserved a table and were seated straight away When we asked for a table she was very rude and said they were fully booked even though we could see lots of empty tables We will not be going back Staff need to learn some manners 
negative; Was very happy to be going here for our meal out But I would never go again our plates were cold and the food was not worth the money it was like baby food just so cold Theere was one member of staff who was very very rude and clearly thought she was better then ourselfs she also pointed at me to her other member of staff and said quot it quot hasn t got a spoon over there I am not an quot it quot and feel very let down for the money spent and come away feeling very low  We would not recommend going there which is such a shame as it does look amazing inside and out but never again And I have now also told all my friends never to go as the service and food is shocking Good luck if you do chance it and go  you may need it 
negative;This is the worst restaurant ive eaten in  the manager is so rude and grumpy  the food is all pre frozen they said they had no potatoes left but i had potatoe skins for starter which i saw them taken out off the freezer  my burger was cold and dry and by the time they come back with chips id finished  what a waste of time and money do not spend your hard earned money here 
negative;Used to visit frequently as a family when this was all day and had never had any problems until our last visit when it seems they have been taken over Changed the name to all day and the quality has gone down hill some of the food was luke warm and some food was so overcooked it was un edible My five year old son had chicken nuggets he couldn t even bite into as they were so hard I chipped a tooth on a chicken skewer it was so dried out After less than a plate full of food that i wouldn t serve to my dog my husband point blank refused to pay for our food and only paid for the drinks Will not be returning Disgusting
negative;Very disappointed in this very overpriced Indian Restaurant If the food was good we could have accepted prices % inflated over other Indian Restaurants in the area We had booked in advance hoping for a good table When we arrived at PM the restaurant was near empty yet we were put round the corner on a very small table We had to put our drinks on the floor since there were four of us struggling with a table more suited for two They didn t even do Kashmir chicken which is our favourite so we accepted Pasander but that was nothing like a good Pasander The chicken was not marinated lacking flavour The mild curry sauce was lumpy and lacked any pleasant texture or taste We concluded the chef was not good at the milder curries But the big thing for us other than the very inflated prices nearly pounds for a large glass of wine we asked for a Rosa but got a house white wine was the awful Nan bread It was not the doughy high flavour bread we had become accustomed to over many years This bread was light powdery and totally lacked flavour By far the worst Indian Restaurant we have ever eaten in and the very first review we have ever done of this kind A meal for of us our share was pounds and we had only beer  one glass of wine and water Very very poor 
negative; We went for afternoon tea at pm approx but should have walked out We were given a menu and informed that there was no food  but when we queried this were offered two flavours of sponge cake The tables were dirty and we asked to have ours cleaned and for the dead flowers to be taken away The tea coffee was OK but the cake disappointing Very expensive compared with other places in the town We will not be going there again 
negative;Waitress was great but food was nothing to shout about Mum ordered half a roast chicken it came out on a plate with a tiny amount of salad and a bowl of chips it was more like half a pheasant than half a chicken Portion sizes and presentation of food really let the place down you walked away feeling like you had been robbed  most disappointing  
negative; My partner was sick soon after the meal here as was I the next day We had eaten here many times it was always never anything special just ok However following this episode we will not be returning 
negative; Don t go there I wish we had read the reviews before we ventured out but it was a impulse decision which we really regretted The service was appalling When we arrived we were greeted by the surliest waitress imaginable The place was virtually empty but she still asked us if we had reserved a table and when we confirmed that we had not she appeared to be dubious about finding us one She then grabbed two menus and stalked off without speaking We were left wondering if we should follow her or remain where we were The Manager had to call her back so that she could ask us to follow her Despite the lack of diners we were only offered a choice of two tables  take it or leave it She was unaware of what beer the bar served The drinks took an age to arrive In the end we were so disgusted with her attitude that we did not wish to be subjected to an unpleasant evening and paid for our drinks and left When asked by the cashier why we were not eating we informed him we were leaving due to the appalling service We paid for the drinks and he had no change to give us  unbelievable He disappeared for ten minutes while we waited for our change We stupidly assumed that he had gone to find the Manager in order that an apology could be made to us  but no that was wishful thinking why weren t we surprised He gave us our change without an apology for the wait or the bad service we had received We left with relief vowing never to set foot in the place again If you want a pleasant dining experience this is not the place to go to 
negative; Please unless you like being ripped off quot Avoid  quot If you are and have never eaten anything other than pot noodles you may think this is ok However it s actually a scam or there abouts for a bottle of wine which I kid you not costs I sell wine  and that is one of the cheapest things on the menu for a bit of mince meat and rice Go there if you want but you have been warned it s awful Situated in a tourist area they don t care 
negative; Awful cold food that was quite frankly inedible Ordered at arrived just before  Tasteless and horrible Gone are the days of good service and nice food Mint dips missing salad missing Seems to of gone right down hill  Very disappointing 
negative; My husband is kurdish and we decided to go to the kurdish restaurant for a dinner and we choose Sarchnar The restaurant was very busy but we found a table near the door where was very cold for our daughter she is years old When we saw another empty table we moved there We been waiting to order food for min our daughter started to cry it was horrible none of the waittress even came and ask what we would like to order They been serving people who came after us We been treating very bad Finally they brought soup but no spoons so we needed to ask for it I lost my patient and called waitress and asked when we will get our food or we are going to another restaurant and she said in min We been waiting again for min Finally we get food : it was delicious thank`s to good cheff I don`t recomend this restaurant to anyone we never been expierenced service like this The owner needs to choose another staff or to teach whem how to treat customers My husband left very disappointed:  
negative;First time going there for a meal what a disappointing meal this was  They don t even bring any cutlery sauces etc over to you we had to go over ourselves Get better service at a bloody Hungry Horse  We ordered a starter which we didnt even get Our mains came out first  we both ordered a burger which was passable untill i noticed the horrific bacon that was just slapped onto the top the bacon was disgusting i wouldnt of even fed this to my dog It was cold uncooked and fat was all over it  I bet they wouldnt eat it themsevles so why should i eat it It was very expensive meal for what we got and i was very very disappointed I eat out quite regulary and ive had better service and food at cheaper places I did let the staff know i wasnt happy with the bacon and he seemed very uninterested if this was me due to working in a customer service environment id be making sure the customer got an apology for the meal Nothing was said and he took our dishes from us when he bought the dessert out So we where sat outside for ages with our old dishes Poor poor poor service I had to ask for them to take off the starter from my bill because we hadnt even received it  It still came to about i thought it was a total ripoff  I had sent them an email of complaint this morning but havent heard back so this is why i am writing on here because maybe they will take me a bit more seriously 
negative; Tables way too small for  Drinks took mins first time and not much improvement second time round The nachos were served on paper which stuck oh yeah I know said the waitress Our daughter said it was chilli without the con carne  tasted like a packet mix stew without the meat  Awful 
negative; Only one vegetarian starter on menu and skin not taken off pumpkin Had avocado salad for main Arrived late because made up before hot food and forgotten Also very small portion even though I d asked if I needed to order extra vegetables Waiter could only suggest I add prawns or tuna Would not return if I had a choice 
negative; I have just returned from an evening meal at Scoff and Banter to say I am disappointed is an understatement We decided to eat there due to some positive reviews and because previous experience when the restaurant had been Relish had been okay and we figured that now the restaurant had time to bed in it would be better How wrong can you be We arrived at pm Because two of our party couldn t come we asked for a smaller more intimate table for the six of us rather than the one we had been allocated opposite the door Our request was swiftly accommodated and we were shown to a booth and an extra table and chairs added for the of us Great start However our new table hadn t been set i e no glasses cutlery or napkins  We ordered wine and water and after a short wait the wine appeared The water was less forthcoming but was eventually brought to the table Food was ordered no starters as we fancied desserts and we settled down to enjoy the evening An hour passed and no food arrived Then a waiter appeared carrying a basket of bread Complimentary bread from the chef apparently to apologise for the slow appearance of our ordered food A nice gesture but the bread arrived without any means to butter it  on the second request knives and side plates for the table eventually appeared Bread mostly demolished we waited on for our main dishes And waited And waited When they eventually appeared we excitedly went about eating once that is we d asked for cutlery and napkins for the third time To our huge disappointment the food was mostly stone cold Personally I can t eat cold steak and chips so I sent mine back and so did someone else The waiter said the steak would be refreshed and returned Giving the benefit of the doubt once more we waited and yes you ve guessed it waited some more Twenty minutes later when our fellow diners had finished our steaks reappeared  new steaks not refreshed ones and fresh chips I appreciated the gesture of giving us new steaks but actually refreshing the old ones would have been ok and reduced the wait This time they were molten and the plates very hot Now the problem was that the steak was very hot and very tough But by this stage I was so hungry I ate it Main meals finished we ordered more wine and after several asks it did appear The water we ordered to accompany it never did By this stage we had resigned ourselves to just getting through things and it was becoming ever more farcical We decided that taking a punt on pudding was just too risky how long would it take to appear All of us had to make it home to relieve babysitters and it was now nearly  We had already flagged to the waiting staff that we weren t impressed and asked for some recognition of the fact we d had a really negative experience but so far no one had come to speak to us about our experience or to apologize When the bill eventually arrived it hadn t been discounted at all We were now really fed up still waiting for someone to come and talk to us and by no means happy to pay for the overall experience At no point had anyone other than the waiter communicated to us unless you count the chef sending us complimentary bread When we told the waiter that we weren t prepared to pay the whole bill he said that all he could do was comp the burger and sea bass  the irony being the sea bass was probably the best thing ordered Still not feeling that our concerns were properly being addressed the waiter agreed to go and speak to the duty manager  The duty manager duly arrived and said he would comp all the food apart from the two steaks that had been replaced By this time we d really had enough  we had gone to the restaurant in good faith to have a meal with friends we eat out regularly and have never had such an appalling experience in Guildford The idea that two steaks that arrived long after everyone else had finished eating and were so hot and tough as to be again fairly unpleasant but eaten due to sheer starvation reasons were worth paying for felt wrong and if they d noticed the chips went back to the kitchen pretty much untouched However in the interests of our waiting taxi and babysitters we settled the bill left our email addresses and took the details of the senior manager to write complaints To provide context for a Saturday night the restaurant wasn t particularly busy Looking around us when waiting for our food most people seemed to be on their desserts so there seemed to be no reason why the food was delayed There were also enough servers given the size of the dining room so again I don t understand why simple requests for water wine cutlery side plates and napkins took so long to materialise and after a lot of asking I dislike writing negative reviews and the one star given is to reflect that the ambience in the restaurant has definitely improved from when it was Relish However if you want a decent meal timely service and an overall positive experience I d give this place a miss 
negative; A disappointing night food terrible service no better I do not get this place at all Full of screaming children Sullen staff and Drunken customers I thought it was a family pub 
negative; Ordered the Big breakfast roll  it was a big roll with sausage the size of small finger a small rasher of bacon a tablespoon of tomatoes small bits of sliced mushrooms and a wee bit of black pudding  all of other only filled half the roll  all for after complaining I was told the portion was a good portion The lay by cafe before this place is only  for much bigger 
negative; Shocking service on many counts and rudeness from the moment we walked in Staff sat drinking but no manager to deal with our complaint 
negative; out for a drive stopped here for a drink my obviously very sick fatherwent in first to find a seat and was promptly told quot we ve stopped serving food quot so impressed with the welcome and customer service NOT we turned on our heels and journeyed on to much more welcoming and enlightened service of The Brittiannia inn whos praises I cannot sing enough SHAME on you pilot inn staff 
negative; We went tonight with friends who eat there regularly They had recommended the Bombay Bistro and I think were quite embarrassed at how poor the service was We ordered our food and it arrived an hour later Well of it did One meal was late arriving and they had forgotten a bread side order which they quickly went to prepare The food was nice nothing special just average After we finished they cleared the table very promptly and brought the hot flannels out After mins we had to call the waiter to get coffees and the bill Just the coffee came and eventually we had to request the bill again The guy doing the take away orders came to the table in his coat to take our payment  It would seem judging by reviews and our friends comments that this is unusual but unfortunately we won t be going back There are much better Indian restaurants in Baldock to enjoy rather than chancing our arm here again Sad face 
negative; Stopped more than a few times on the way from Winchester to Cornwall for breakfast because it is so convenient Definitely will not bother any more On each visit we hoped it would be a little more pleasant and the lady owner maybe a little more friendly than the last time and perhaps have some recognition for our regularity but no not the case She is extremely rude and grumpy and the food isn t really that great either She is definitely not a people s person and I would recommend she looks for another job Such a shame the shop sells lovely things and mainly local goods too and the whole place has so much potential Her husband seemed very nice poor chap 
negative; visited with family for a meal because we had nothing for tea we now wish we had gone shopping before eating here and cooked at home to start with we where seated at a table where a family had already been seated at We then got moved to a drafty corner and bearing in mind that we are an older family i am  my sister  and my brother  we where sat in the children s area To be honest we should have walked out at this point when ordering the meals we requested a change to one of the smothered chicken  from chips to jacket the server just heard that we wanted a jacket potato and had to check with the chef if that was possible  we had to correct her that it was a meal we wanted but jacket instead of chips When the meal arrived the sides where incorrect  my brother had corn on the cob instead of the beans he wanted there was no gravy with my sisters meal  the servers obviously don t check the tickets before taking the meals out  and onto the meals  the WORST we have had out in a long time My dad ordered the meat filled pie  with pieces of quot meat quot  Ive had better cheaper smothered chickens the bacon was hardly cooked the chicken was chewy and had pink veins running through and the jacket wasn t fully cooked My mum had ordered the smothered chicken with chips and she had the same issues with the chicken we did get a refund for the shocking meals but we hardly ate anything  my dad didn t eat any of his we haven t been to cheswold s for a few years and now we remember why the food is shocking and extremely over priced there is no communication between staff and their excuse is quot its been one of those days quot  because of this you have lost our custom  we would rather and should have eaten at mcdonalds instead  On talking to customers at neighbouring tables the only reason they visit is because their children like the play area they too find the food to be consistently terrible i would advise anyone to think twice about eating here  use frankie and bennies or mcdonalds instead 
negative;Utter horror  nearlly minutes to get a menu The waitress was aggressively rude and food dire  quot Seafood ramen quot had cheap frozen luridly pink quot crab sticks quot floating in it and one mushroom Having lived in Japan for several years I was excited about this place and invited friends to join me The sake came without cups and when they finally arrived it was cold  the cups were full of dust Even the tea was stone cold I have never in my life seen quot beef quot like the leathery straps of hell floating over my friend s bowl We had to use an entire bottle of soya sauce to season the pints of fluid in which our over cooked swollen instant noodles sat Awful in every respect 
negative; We were a party of on a Monday evening in August  hr mins for starters to appear and the food was very disappointing The free refills of chips were not required as they were so soggy and soft no one wanted any more  of our party had the skate wings on the specials board and they had to be sent back as they were dry and overcooked One of us struck lucky and really enjoyed his starter  main To her credit the manageress handled our complaints very professionally and calmly We were not charged for all the starters and main courses A disappointing evening 
negative; I wore a warm winter dress and found this restaurant so cold I had to put my fleece coat back on about mins after sitting at our table Even then I was still chilly and wished I had a thick jumper too  The chairs are really uncomfortable My husband is over  tall and he was only just able to put his feet flat on the floor because the chairs were so high I m  quot tall and was left with my legs dangling like a toddler Propping my heels against the chairlegs meant I had great cramp in my calves when I left merely mins later The lighting is so dim in the restaurant trying to read black print on a burgundy background made the menu a real trial There wasn t even a candle on the table we could use to help N B I had a medical less than days ago and was told I had perfect eyesight  The service was quick but a little irritating being asked times if our meal was ok as we were trying to have a conversation The waitress didn t seem to understand English we had to tell her twice we didn t want the dessert menu and we then had to ask twice for the bill too  As for the food the mixed starter was lovely be warned though the potato cake and kebab were a lot spicier than usually served in Indian restaurants  They can t cook prawns to save their lives The prawn starter I had was as tough as leather I mentioned this to the manager when he asked if the food was ok and he told me it s because it was deep fried What rubbish It s not how they re cooked that made them rubbery it s how long they were cooked for  about mins too long would be my guess They obviously have no customer care So summing up take lots of thick clothing so you don t freeze take a footstool so you can reach the ground when you sit at the table take a torch so you can read the menu and don t bother ordering prawns unless you want to resole your shoes  What a poor representation of Indian dining lucky there s at least two other good restaurants far superior to this in the area 
negative; Oh dear Oh dear Where to begin The enthusiasm from the staff was so underwhelming even smiling at them did not help It is heartbreaking that a franchise like KFC can have the temerity to keep this open The seating area has stools that have large splits in them the toilets had run out of paper and the dryer was not working  They are busy but one wonders how much repeat business they have certainly not ours Someone please help them quickly 
negative; Went for quick lunch with grandchildren  was very disappointed with the quality of food Children s pasta came out with about  pieces of pasta in a bowl with a slice of rock hard flat bread The adult sandwiches came out as unbuttered dry baps really unacceptable but in a situation with small boys  a baby we just eat what we could paid up  left Not going back  A complete waste of money 
negative; Went with friends on Saturday night It was extremely busy but not an acceptable reason for our waitress to be as rude as she was Everything was an effort and she should possibly consider an alternative career or customer service training We were advised that there was a minute delay which then became minutes and we finally got our food an hour after ordering and only when we enquired as to its whereabouts and advised how long we had waited Sadly it wasn t worth the wait Over cooked and dried out The side salad was a joke and in edible All in all a thoroughly unenjoyable experience and one that we won t be repeating 
negative;My sister and I went there for a quick breakfast with her month old sleeping baby before jumping on the tube When we walked in to the large empty restaurant at am on Sunday we were greeted by a lady with her hands on her hips followed by her stern instructions of quot Did you not read the sign  strictly no prams unless folded up quot and refused entry unless we abided by her rules Put aside the fact that my sister had just flown from Australia with a month old and was exhausted what kind of a place of that size with a completely empty restaurant would deny a sleeping baby in a pram If they want to stick to this ridiculous stupid rule I suggest they get better mannered staff to explain it to what seems like their rare customer 
negative;The place is lovely The food was not great and the service very slow We ordered steak and ale pie the meat was fatty the peas lukewarm the chips were horrible The oil needs changing Both my husband and I were ill afterwards Won t be going back
negative;Eight of us had planned a girls night out unfortunately due to the sickness bug that was going round four of us were unable to go When we turned up the owner of the restaurant told us off for not ringing and letting them know We then had to wait about mins to have our order taken another for a starter to arrive another for our main to arrive People who arrived after us were being served and leaving a long time before we were The food was awful and we barely touched the main It was very disappointing as I d been there five years before and loved it I think the owners are becoming rather arrogant and complacent as they have such a good reputation in Salisbury Carry on like this though and they won t keep that good reputation for long 
negative; I suppose like most chain pubs you get what you pay for  The salad is nice and regularly changed but the mains are a bit grim yes the meat is grill cooked but the rest of the main is packet prepared veg or potatoes  not good The service when we visited was terrible with a wait of almost an hour for the food when the pub was not busy and no apology given for the delay  Wouldn t visit again 
negative; Such a shame Planned a day in London to meet friends we haven t seen for years Arrived at pm for cocktails Service truly appalling  up to min wait between drinks waiting staff rude wrong orders couldn t have been worse Had lunch which was good and service friendly Went back upstairs as waiting for more friends and if anything it got worse We decided at  to leave after the hostess told me she had no recollection of my order despite she had been to tell me they didn t have the wine I ordered Insisted that service charge was taken off the bill We went to Searcy s at St Pancras  what a difference  staff couldn t have been more helpful or pleasant All this for We looked at the bill in detail to find we had been charged for champagne we did not have Never again 
negative; I ordered a dish which was supposed to be chicken with cashew nuts I m not sure what the meat was but it s nothing I ve ever eaten before and I ve tried most things It was rubbery with an almost squeaky texture and no flavour I felt sick after the first mouthful 
negative; As we walked in through the book shop with our child there was a sign by the stairs to leave your buggy downstairs We were concerned it might not be there when we came down again There s not always someone by the till in the shop to even keep an eye on the buggies When we took the risk of losing our buggy we headed upstairs The staff were very unwelcoming We felt completely ignored and this place is NOT child friendly As our child started to play in the fenced off child area they seemed to think we would sit on the one table in there We noticed it was covered in crumbs and eventually a young boy cleared the table when asked by the very unwelcoming woman who was working there that day We noticed he still didn t wipe it We chose to sit on a table next to the child area where we could keep an eye on our child On their website they say it s a family run business but this place doesn t feel like it Family businesses are meant to feel warmer and welcoming towards the customers How can their business work if they look like they don t want to work there When we got there there wasn t really much left on the menu We realise we went later in the day but after requesting food twice that was on the menu we were told they had run out Then we asked for something that they did have on the menu without mustard but was already in it I thought it was all freshly prepared Then we went to tell her we ll go somewhere else she then smiled and looked happy that we had left Won t ever be coming here again 
negative;We have been to zen a few times  the last time was awful so thought we would give it one more try This time was even worse The chicken was just mush  I literally had to spit it out it made me gag Will never go back ever again 
negative;Visited Indigo on Saturday night after a few drinks in Shields got there around pm and only one table of customers in Waiter was so miserable when he took our order not a thank you in sight Food arrived relatively quick but again no conversation on its arrival Ordered chicken chat starter which was ok but nothing amazing main course arrived and again quite bland and waiter never spoke a word Don t expect full on conversations but a little politeness would not have hurt Doubt we will go back there anytime soon 
negative; Just got takeout from here Burger wasn t cooked through despite me letting them know I was pregnant Lamb chops were covered in a sauce when we d asked for them to be plain and everything was going cold when we arrived home minutes away We had to be refunded for onion rings as there weren t any This was our first visit and we won t be back 
negative; I asked for toby house salmon salad it came with the most enormous lettuce leaves even the waitress said i d look like a rabbit when i finished eating it Apart from that there was other lettuce on my plate with half a tomato pieces of cucumber and carrot and bits of red onion the salad looked pathetic I think they need lessons on how to present a salad and what to put on it Will not go there again 
negative; Well overpriced served by teenagers who just want to know what time they are finishing Sandwiches starting from and the filling is very poor When you ask for coffee if you want milk they charge you extra You can be stood at the counter for five mins waiting to be served and nobody is in front of you 
negative; I went here with my family on weekday evening for a meal When our meal came they were ALL mixed up We re not a fussy bunch and would normally not complain but seeing as i was pregnant i had to send my steak back as i had asked for it well done and it came out full of blood which i couldn t eat My partner also sent his steak back as it was cold and burnt  After far too long they brought us our meals back and it was clear they had just swapped his steak for mine which was not completly cold and his was cut up no idea why they had cut his steak up and we think it was the one i had sent back to top it off i wasn t % convinved i had steak and it was crumbleing when i cut it and had a very odd taste Fair to say i could not eat it and left my entire meal A few other family members also gave up half way through their meals as they tastes terrible or they were cold We decided we d all get desert as you can t really go wrong with this  We found that none of the desserts were freshly made and seeing as this is right next to a morrisons supermarket we recognised a few puddings from their frozen isles They were tasty enough but not what we were expecting or worth how much they were charging for them It is shame because the atmosphere is lovely and this could be a fab place to go for meals It is menat to be value for money some might say you get what you pay for this is not the case As i paid for food and i could not eat it My recceomenddation is not to eat here 
negative; Was looking forward to a pasta lunch with my friend today but was hugely disappointed Ordered at and left at  without eating Ordered pasta and mins later a noodle meal was bought instead as had no pasta We were not informed on ordering that there was no pasta but kitchen staff assumed noodles would be fine This meal was declined and we ordered a different meal to be told they didn t have that either So we then ordered a third choice and instead of being a priority as the staff had clearly messed up we were put to the bottom of the queue again Needless to say after hr and mins after our first order and still no sign of food we cancelled our order got a refund and left The restaurant was not busy but there seemed to be hardly any staff What a terrible experience 
negative; Orders two ultimate bacon and cheese burger with soaking wet salad and chips The burger was tasteless looked like a dollop of mince meat flattened and drowned in grease when brought to the attention of waitress her reply was we sell lots of them and still managed to give us a bill for Do your selves a favour and go to the beef eater up the road 
negative; We waited an hour in the cold before we were let inside there was no queuing system except a sign informing us not to queue outside the tanning shop next door no one took down our names and no one gave us an estimated waiting time After minutes we were beginning to wonder if we were queuing for anything at all The food was lukewarm and no hot drinks were available I requested gluten free as they had confirmed this was available but this actually meant having a burger without a bun I opted for the vegetarian and received a quot large plain mushroom quot as the waiter described it surrounded by lettuce in a polystyrene burger box called quot bits in a box quot  Unlike me he seemed to find this an acceptable meal Over all the experience at Patty s was cold and disappointing 
negative;Sorry but I have to say that this restaurant needs a sort out Indifferent staff and poor food The salad bar can look really warm and sad in the middle of the afternoon  Not a good idea to see the chefs leaning on the outside wall smoking 
negative; After being recommended to the Dovecote by a friend We booked for Sunday lunch th September The restaurant was empty and cold  so we sat in the lounge It was a carvery lunch and at first glance the roasts looked very inviting The man carving the meat was very surly  quot have you got your tickets quot he snapped I chose the turkey and my husband had the pork I coundnt eat the turkey it was so overcooked and dry My husbands pork looked cremated and he said it was awful The yorkshire puddings were a disgrace After five minutes we upped and left after paying No one asked whether we had enjoyed the meal We shant be going there again 
negative; Amazing starter of crab chowder was absolutely delicious massively disappointed by the sea bream as the quot Mediterranean salad quot was a tiny bit of rocket and a small tomato Pavlova had no meringue and when we complained we were told you only get a drizzle on the bottom  Service was good but as I ve been quite ill all night I will not be going back again 
negative;a starter of crisps with a little bit of melted cheese on it The menu said that it was with onions but I expected small pieces of potatoes The pizza was supposed to have cheese edges it did have puffed up pizza but no cheese in it A disgusting meal 
negative;Sadly will not be visiting this place again My husband and I ordered the boneless beef rib and it was really awful the First piece I cut into was like shards of plastic as it was so hard and dry I spat that bit out I tried some from the middle to see if it was any better it wasn t my husbands was the same it was like it been cooked hours before left out to dry out and then zapped in a microwave the green beans were almost raw and the sweet potato chips were burnt at the edges We did send it back and got it refunded on the bill thankfully but we had gone to have a meal not to get a refund I only wish I had taken a photo
negative; A group of six of us visited Sunday Lunchtime Was very disappointed with the menu no A La Carte as shown on website available should have checked before booking I had the roast Beef and at the beef was so tough At least the waitress did immediately offered to replace it but by the time my second meal came the rest of the group had finished Had the ice cream Sundae  no chocolate sauce and two scoops of Vanilla ice cream instead of Coconut as advertised Will not be returning here at the high prices they charge On a good note the staff were very attentive 
negative;Visited this coffee shop today with a friend who suggested we try it and also based on favourable reviews on Tripadvisor On arrival it was fairly quiet as it was about pm and the lunch rush seemed to be over It was stiflingly hot inside as despite it being degrees outside there were no windows open in the cafÇ¸ The cafÇ¸ stated it was counter service so we joined the queue with two customers ahead of us We waited minutes to be served because the two staff at the counter while friendly were very disorganised I ordered the Bywell Smoked Salmon  Cream Cheese sandwich displayed on the chalkboard menu Unfortunately I was told this was unavailable as their delivery of Smoked Salmon had not arrived If they knew it was unavailable why couldn t they have removed it from the chalkboard My alternative was a Tuna  Chive sandwich which was tasty and also served with a couple of crisps and a slice of melon which I found rather odd Portion size was small for the price as has been commented on previous reviews My experience of lunch at Blacksmiths Coffee Shop was very disappointing and didn t live up to the previous glowing reviews I won t hurry back and wouldn t recommend it 
negative; Arrived at the thatched house for dinner and eventually managed to find a table that wasn t dirty When the food arrived my meal was cold The chips were cold and dry as a bone the same as the chicken I asked politely if they would just microwave it as I hate to complain but really didn t want to eat it cold Then my partner found a piece of glass in his steak How brown glass that looked like it was from a beer bottle had gotten into his steak is beyond me but clearly there is a lot left to be desired in the name of hygiene and health and safety That was the nail in the coffin for us and we couldn t continue to eat We brought this to the managers attention who did not charge us for our food but made it clear we must pay for the drinks  I wasn t expecting free drinks but she was hardly apologetic and polite She seemed disinterested I don t think we will return this was one of my worst dining experiences I ve had 
negative; left before eating the rudeness of the quot staff quot propped up on the bar was baffling fairly obvious they do not want to serve customers After asking if they were still serving lunchtime on a sunday and receiving a curt quot yes until pm quot I then asked if we could sit anywhere Another curt quot yes quot  then the lady went back to her drink  minutes later she had another  minutes later another member of staff appeared and went outside for a drink  minutes later we left don t give it long as a business 
negative;Family of arrived pm Sunday night to celebrate my grandfathers birthday All seemed well up until after ordering when food arrived x Steaks x Sunday roast  ALL the steaks were stone cold everything from the meat to the chips A few family members sent some meals back a few put up with it We were seated near a party of about which were shouting across the room getting up for photos and were generally very annoying After complaining to management about the other guests and the appalling food they told us the meal would be % free Which is fine but this spoilt a special day for my grandfather and it kind of leaves a sour taste in your mouth about returning to the restaurant Would I recommend On this situation I would advise to void like the plague  
negative; Visited the ground floor cafe on Monday th December around lunch time Ordered the Lamb  Feta pasta bake Lemon Chicken Tagine and a Millionaire Mocha between myself and my mum  The ladies serving within the cafe were brilliant however the quality of the food was abominable After spending over a total of  we left dissatisfied and still hungry The food was tasteless and completely unappetising After being customers for many years at Marks  Spencer I and my family are so disappointed we shall not be returning to their eateries and supermarkets 
negative; Hard seats uncomfortable surroundings asked to move and waitress barely understood a word i was saying Rude staff glorified Macdonalds to be honest only came here as halal but nothing to rush back for to be honest 
negative; Popped into dobbies today had a roast at the gammon was fab as for the rest of it  it was unedible frozen veg that was Luke warm and over cooked never again and I simply don t recommend any one to waist there money there as for that we done a bit of Xmas shopping only to get to the tills with only people working them and the shortest que was of people in front of us so we put all the stuff back  poor service and poor food 
negative; It was my work leaving lunch and I picked this place as it was new I did read reviews on other sites and got worried about the poor level of service and really at that point I should have cancelled  The ten of us arrived and sat down The restaurant was empty It took mins to get drinks and hour to get our food order with one of our party still waiting for her salad for a further mins after this  It was awful as various members of the party had to keep getting up to find the two sparkless waitresses to ask when we were going to be served  Once we got our food it wasn t that good and one member of the party said her lobster was quot overcooked and cold quot  Whilst everyone was eating I got up to pay and the computers all crashed so I had to wait a further mins while the waitresses strolled around trying to fix it Disaster  why would anyone come here 
negative; Went for lunch on Sunday as part of a large booked party they could not cope we had our meal after an unacceptable long wait about hour the food Sunday roast was delivered to our table swimming in gravy DRIPPING OFF THE PLATE which drowned very small potions of veg The Yorkshire puddings were brown inside and uneatable and tasted awful The waiters were very young school boys who did their best but they and the kitchen could not cope with the numbers which I find disgraceful as they knew our party was expected When we complained the woman in charge just said we should have complained sooner but as the young boys were so busy there was opportunity to do so it was only when she appeared behind the bar later we had an opportunity to do so I would not recommend the Tudor houses for SUNDAY LUNCH OR PARTY VENUE 
negative; I have never been so appalled by the service in a pub until now Went into this Wetherspoons before a JAY Z concert and first found the tables in a mess which considering it was busy i thought to be understandable Went to order a drink for myself and my friend only to be abruptly told that rose wine was not served by the glass despite the menu showing this option Then I order food a chicken burger which i added mozzarella and bacon the sever read the order back and had mistakenly put cheese which i corrected politely even checking quot Do you serve mozzarella as a extra as states in the menu quot which he reassured me that they did I order a tikka for my friend The food came quiet promptly with the duty manager pixie blond short hair who practically shoved the plates at us i immediately noticed there was cheese and not mozzarella which i queried only to be told quot we have never done mozzarella quot she left without asking to swap change my burger or helping us find sauces which we asked about On further inspection the chicken in the burger was rock solid difficult to even chew and my friends tikka came without naan which we tried to get a waitresses attention who was purposely avoiding us we both ended up not eating out meals and this time my friend went to get us drinks only to have a different member of staff service her a glass of rose wine Just shocking to have been treated by some members of staff and shows not knowledge of their own menu A waste of 
negative; of us booked a table for a meal last nite although bar was empty our table wasn t ready when seated table was sticky and dirty were told there was a wait on food y no idea when food arrived was awful my chicken stack was a pre frozen piece of chicken just shown bbq sauce with bacon I think and cheese was laughable tasteless the peas had been pre cooked and warmed slightly chips were chips fish and chips were tasteless burger was rubber the bun wasn t edible mixed grill well the steak was cremated on outside rare on inside we all had different meals and all left majority of food not once were we asked y staff friendly enough but the chef needs to b replaced as they obviously cant cook very disappointing as was my works leaving dinner for myself I wouldn t eat here or recommend to anyone other restaurants and bars were buzzing this place was empty says it all  
negative; I went here for a Christmas lunch paid for by my employer There were six of us and the pub was not busy Staff very pleasant and attentive but the food well and truly let them down We had pre ordered the previous week I ordered Harissa baked salmon with roasted vegetables on a bed of purÇ¸ed butternut squash as main and cheese and chutney soufflÇ¸ with pear salad for starter The starter was ok but the main was not good I know I had to order the salmon the previous week but I didn t think they would cook it then too The salmon was well over cooked and dry and the roasted vegetables undercooked and hard Probably one of the worst meals if not the worst I have ever had Salmon is very difficult to mess up I would have thought even I can cook a decent salmon A disappointment The staff did ask us if food was ok at starter stage but not when we had our main If they had asked then I would have said something I did not volunteer my comments at the time because I was being treated to the meal and it just didn t feel it appropriate to complain However afterwards I felt compelled to do this review because it wasn t good I don t think the other meals were much better either I notice that up until about August the food appeared to be good judging by other reviews up to that time Something has gone wrong since then I thought it might be just the Christmas menu that was lacking but there seem to be other general reviews about the other food not being good Someone else said this is a prime location in Twickenham There is a lot of good competition The pub needs to up its game somewhat to compete Definitely a wasted opportunity for the pub I won t eat there again 
negative; I have just got home from visiting this restaurant and have to say I am disgusted I have never writen a review as soon as I come home but I must say this place is far to expensive for the bland tasting food but what has repulsed me the most that my partner witnessed a table slightly behind me so I did not see what happened but the table were being served deserts and the waitress had a bowl of ice cream in her hand in which a fly had landed on my partner said that she took a moment and clearly was thinking what to do but what she decided to do was to blow the fly away and served that same bowl of ice cream to the unsuspecting customer unfortunately the staff do not wear name tags but she was about years old blonde with a tattoo of a bike on her back this girl should not be in the food industry if she makes decisions like that cos we all know that fly s wonder on turds Oh and the floor in the restaurant was filthy Would never go back 
negative; Xmas party of we jfst be served what they call a pudding  Entertainment is great food and bar service is really poor 
negative; My daughter booked for adults and children over the phone the lady who took the call told her that because of the large number of people going that the adults would be charged each we were over the moon and told all of our family and friends that attended different story after we de all eaten and I went to pay they charged us normal price and then tried to say that this woman had not said this SHE CERTAINLY DID WILL NOT EVER BE GOING THERE AGAIN and will make sure we all tell everyone we know to go to a different buffet restaurant Food was not hot also 
negative; Visited the Barn for a friends birthday on news years day and was disappointed for few reasons My friend ordered a black coffee which we had to remind them to bring We asked whether we could order some drinks and was told we had to order our food otherwise they wouldn t get the table back in time in a rushed tone After asking whether we could swap poached eggs in the breakfast for fried we were told they didn t do it even though they had friend eggs on toast on the menu Asked for more toast and had to remind them again Breakfast was okay but but the hash browns were dried out and impossible to eat the sausages were very cheap and anemic and the poached eggs didn t run  Overall the service was poor especially from the man who I assumed was in charge I can only assume they were all hungover from the day before However it was extremely cheap and the location and decor is lovely  
negative;I was shocked and upeer with how my friend and I was treated My friend paid for drinks using her car five minutes at our table we were confronted with the bar lady advising the payment had not gone through I went back to the bar and advised I was happy to pay on my card but I would like to have the declined card receipt I was then approached by I very rude woman advising she was the manager and that it was simple if we did not pay we would have to leave I explained that at no point was I refusing to pay I just wanted to have the declined card receipt She then said it had been thrown away I paid for the drinks using a separate card and then was harassed by the so called manager following me and my friend around We even had our bags searched I am a polite and friendly individual who cause no trouble I felt harassed and victimised I have reported this case and the bar is now under investigation 
negative; Cutlery is always dirty and tables often left cluttered with other people s leftovers Trays look old and tatty Often toaster or coffee machine not working 
negative; I dined here a few days ago after a recommendation and found myself totally disgusted with the whole evening Service was extremely very slow i was gasping for a drink for a very long time the food at first seemed very well presented however lacked taste boring decor and long queue for the toilet Defiantly over rated  i would need a lot of convincing to even think about returning 
negative;We decided to go to the Countryman for Christmas Day lunch as we had previously eaten there and thoroughly enjoyed our meal We thought the place was very pleasant big mistake On arrival at  for lunch at  the doors were locked I went round the back and saw the landlord who said the doors weren t open until No greeting of merry Christmas or sorry I will open the doors We were just expected to wait in the car At  we went in and my son in law went to the bar and said merry Christmas to which the girl replied quot oh yeah what do you want quot  We were told that we had our time wrong and that our meal was  and not Ok our mistake we thought At  a waitress came and said quot we are ready for you if you want to come through quot  funny We were shown to our table and given our glass of sparkling wine The waitress dropped four glasses of wine over one of our party She was obviously embarrassed and sort of apologised Another waitress we think was the landlady was actually rude to our family member as if it was her fault She didn t apologise or offer any form of compensation A bottle of wine would have seemed appropriate We then started our meal At one point when the courses came out we had to sort out who was having what As you can imagine with a party of we had to refer to our notes The waitresses were very rude with their looks to each other as if to say get a move on There was absolutely no friendliness from the staff at all Not even a smile In fact not one person wished any of us merry Christmas A bit much considering three of our party were children The food itself was good although the desserts left a little to be desired We were disappointed that there was no childrens menu when we booked but decided to go with it Obviously the menu wasn t really aimed at children so they ate very little As we were having dessert my husband went to the bar for some more drinks two of which were glasses of water The landlord said quot have you finished the water on the table quot to which my husband replied quot what water we weren t given any quot  The landlord called a waitress over and said quite tersely quot get some water on that table now quot  But of course by then we were on coffees and far to late We had glasses of water from the bar before that and nothing had been said Not all of our party had coffee including the children but only those having coffee were given mince pies and truffles The rest were given nothing Obviously this had all been paid for At  per head for each adult and  per head for each child plus money spent over the bar I think The Countryman made enough money out of our party To be honest when we booked we were expecting something special Instead it was a very disappointing interruption to our lovely family Christmas Day We were made to feel like a total inconvenience to them all and just in their way If they don t want to give a pleasant and good service they shouldn t do the job I understand Christmas Day must be stressful for them but that s no reason to ruin other people s Christmas Day lunch especially after what it cost Not only will none of our party go there for Christmas Day again but on any other day A complete waste of almost If I could have given a minus star for service I would have 
negative; I went to the take away part of this place today and the only thing worse than the food was the service I was served by a young lady who was abrupt and quite frankly looked like she should be on suicide watch I appreciate that nobody wants to work new years day but there is no need for bad customer service I only ordered chips and gravy and somehow they managed to stretch this out to a minute wait When I got my food home I discovered that the gravy was inedible I could only describe it as looking like pond water Unfortunately I cannot comment on its taste as i had to pour it down the sink It is safe to say that I will not be visiting again 
negative;Came here for lunch during a shopping visit in Cambridge with my mum  sister On arrival we waited over minutes for anyone to come over to us and take a drink order from us We were advised that the wait for food was minutes which was very confusing and the restaurant itself on a Monday lunch time was not busy After over an hour our food finally came and the portion size of the Gamberoni was tiny Had this dish elsewhere before and it was definitely bigger it was gone so quickly after waiting for such a long time  The restaurant was extremely cold service exceptionally slow  food average We won t visit again 
negative; We read the reviews  eat a lot of Thai food when dining out so we re looking forward to our meal The food was terrible we were a party of eight We all had different starters which none were great The fisher mans Thai soup had obviously had frozen fish put into it which diluted the already tasteless liquid to nothing but water as it had defrosted during the preparation you could not taste any lemongrass or kafir leaf at all mains soft shell crab was just an over fried battered mess that disintegrated when touched and tasteless whole sea bass was full of bones and was over cooked and bland squid we ll don t even go there did we complain  chance would of been a fine thing % of the staff we re stood outside smoking while a minority were rushed off their feet so dissapointing When we did pay  fill out the customer feed back form two members of staff were seen reading it but never came over to us The only bonus is that we can all lay off our diets this week as the toilet trips we have all been subject to since this experience will have done the world of good with weight loss 
negative; I and a large group of ladies have just had christmas lunch and as we came last year and enjoyed it very much we decided to come again  but oh what a mistake although waitress was very nice food and service was awful Turkey to dry  roast potatoes to hard to put your fork in  veg like water with no taste not one empty plate lots of waste And all this after waiting mins for our second course  then told the sweet we wanted was not available bear in mind we booked about six weeks ago and told them what meals we wanted enough said lost custom of people 
negative; Pre booked a table for  people for When we arrived was told this was our table only had seating for people so I queried this and they said no problem would sort it they then had to move people around so not a good start then apologised and said that there s two bookings with simulat names ordered drinks which they couldn t even get that right some of family ordered starters which most of them were ok my sons starter was so over cooked well burnt that he could not eat it Which the waiter was told about and he said I will tell the kitchen One of the starters never arrived with everyone else s  had to ask for it a couple of times they said the bread was in the oven it eventually came well the bread arrived and the the olives did turn up Main meals started to arrive my brother ordered a Burger meal which was freezing cold on arrival so he sent it back so never ate as they had to leave at  as his wife had to go to work He asked for his bill in plenty of time  waited minutes and still no bill All the chicken meals that were ordered none of the chicken was cooked all pink inside they were not offered anything in its place my steak should of been well done half of it was the other half was still bloody had to keep asking for drinks and then you had to wait there were couples in there as it was valentines and they all walked out and complained also there was another party of that were booked for they had the same complaints as us would never go again nor recommend  I know it was valitines day and you know it s going to be busy but the service and the food was beyond a joke manager was actually rude the way he spoke to his staff They lost a hell of a lot off money that night  
negative; We were drawn in by the advert for a crab sandwich Queued for minutes to order food at the counter they make everything one by one  which takes ages especially if a big order for a family  Once it was my turn was told they didn t have crab today Even though it was clearly on there menu at the counter A simple sold out sign would have been nice Didn t want to have to queue for another mins so had to make a quick decision Opted for a jacket potato with prawn Mayo and salad and a coronation chicken sarni  My jacket was hard and quite cold with very little salad even though paid extra p for it Very disappointed The chicken sandwich was in a big bap which was dry Overall worst lunch for a long time It is catering for mass production rather than quality 
negative; We used to visit Bury lane cafÇ¸ frequently It used to offer excellent fresh food for a good value Recently however we have noticed a significant change Whether it is under new management or some other events took place we are not sure But it would appear they no longer cook their food fresh instead it seems to be brought in and re heated The quality has gone really down while the prices have gone up and quite a bit too The staff are lovely but the food is mediocre and it is definitely not a good value for money Won t be returning in a hurry 
negative; Just had the worst fish and chips takeaway that I have ever tasted uncooked fish and soggy chips Don t waste your money Straight in the bin 
negative; Just been here for lunch and I asked for a tuna salad and my husband asked for a Ploughman s Lunch Now how difficult can a salad be It was the most bland rubbish salad I have ever had The tuna had just been tipped out of the tin and was dry as a bone I asked for salad cream and they had run out My husband s Ploughman s lunch was the same bland salad as mine with slithers of cheese Not the chunks of tasty cheese you expect The ham was a slice and the chutney was Branston Pickle Wish I had stayed at home and made my own 
negative; We visited on a Sunday in August  I fancied the salad nicoise with seabass my husband the fish  chips again seabass  We have no seabass re ordered after a long wait our food arrived Disappointing  a burger and something else So memorable I have forgotten My husband asked for bread we don t do bread on a Sunday Had we not been part way through a bottle of wine we would probably have left I am not a mean complainer  we didn t even bother Nibbled around the edges supped up  paid up  Disappointing as All Bar Ones are generally good 
negative; First time using Fishers of Hunstanton for a takeaway we live in Hunstanton  well was a total let down even the outer box of the carton was dripping in oil when Hubby brought it home hope it s not in the car  the outer wrapping of white paper also saturated in grease WHY the presence of the oil and the fact that it was EVERYWHERE whilst we tried to get the food onto the pre warmed plates it just put us off the meal and added to the fact that there was a mountain of pale undercooked chips was disgusting 
negative; of us went for dinner at the Pig after it was recommended to us Upon arriving the staff were friendly and attentive whilst we had a drink in the bar waiting to be seated Once we were seated in the restaurant it was as if we had magically be covered in invisible dust The service was virtually non existent We watched waiting staff walk passed our table without a look in our direction We had to catch the waiters attention for everything drinks orders food bill We didn t have one waiter serving our table No one came to ask if our food was ok Some teas were not delivered to the table which were ordered but we re still added to the bill The restaurant added % service charge We complained as we received no service and it was removed from the bill The food was ok but very expensive You have to pay for sides which are around  each so some veg and potatoes comes to  per person before you ve ordered the main to go with it The lack of service made this establishment star for me I wouldn t bother going back 
negative; Being a lover of Chinese I thought I would give this Restaurant a try The Restaurant is nice as you walk in we sat down to just a spoon and fork my partner wanted a bottle of Bulmers  which they only had one bottle so anybody else wanting one it was tough The food selection was not very good and was cold won t be going back unless things change The Deserts were like a Sweet Shop with Haribos Wine Gums etc The good thing about it I could use my Tastecard there Wont be hurrying back 
negative; My husband recieved food poisioning after eating under cooked scampi  it was watery inside we complained and it was taken away and replaced i believe it was re heated  disgusting place could not even get my order correct and the drink order was mixed up causing the company to waste single gins young in experienced staff  we stayed in an amazing bed and breakfast and i passed on my concerns it will not be revommended meanwhile i have a very sick husband and our little break to help him recover from his mothers death  was spoilt  absolute disgrace 
negative; We arrived around : after driving up from the Isle of Wight Parked the car and went in for some food Pub wasn t excessively busy but the staff were not overly interested in customers or removing dirty plates no menus  condimentson the tables upstairs either Once we d placed our order there was a bit of a wait for the food but it did eventually arrive it tasted great and portion size was generous  However the whole experience has been ruined by a  parking fine received today in the post We never saw a single notice to advise payment was required nor a payment machine to pay and we parked right next to the pub entrance At no time did any of the staff ask or tell us about the parking restrictions According to the staff member we spoke to today if your a customer of the pub you don t have to pay parking But that s not what the parking womble company are saying I think this is disgusting and unacceptable practice clearly designed to catch people out  Lovely location but not worth the hassle afterwards to have to deal with an unjust  fine 
negative;Booked for Sunday lunch at pm on the Originally booked for people later changed it to people Upon arrival found that the booking had not been changed to people Arrived at pm for the pm booking were shown to the table immediately before drinks could be ordered No starters were ordered but even so our main course did not arrive until pm This is totally unacceptable and no explanation was given except quot we are very busy quot  If the staff cannot cope they should not accept the bookings We even had to wait a long time before we received the billI We certainly would not recommend this pub to anyone and will not be returning 
negative; Went here for a few drinks and some food after work We hadn t booked so sat downstairs and ordered food at the bar  Burger came mins later  fast  too fast  Burger was cold and tasteless like it had been sitting on the side for an hour  I can honestly say it was the worst burger i have ever had in my life  Defiantly will not be returning 
negative; We have been regular visitors for weekend coffee  breakfast for the last few years but have been disappointed with the level of sevice recently You order food  coffee at the same time but the coffee is either cold or drunk by the time the food finally arrives minutes later After suffering this for weeks in a row we raised it with them  were told without apology it was on its way It took a further minutes to arrive There seems to now be a blatant disregard for customer service which is a real shame as it used to be great in every way We will not be visiting again 
negative; Decided to pop here for lunch today big mistake  I asked for a cheese and chutney sandwich on white bread with some chips and my husband had the fish finger sandwich The presentation when they arrived left a lot to be desired mine had three chunks of cheese on a unbuttered poppyseed bap with chips thrown on the side and my husbands had bits of fish and a couple of lettuce leaves there was no garnish and obviously whoever had prepared them couldn t care less how they looked my cheese looked as if it had been taken straight off a cheese board as it was in wedges and still had the rind on it beggars belief And the chips were obviously frozen chips and we had o couple each on our plate which looked as if they had been through the fryer several times suffice to say I didn t eat mine and we won t be going back We used to visit the boat in regularly every Sunday and never had any problems but it s been a while since we went and I can only guess that it s either a different owner or chef either of which obviously couldn t care less  AVOID 
negative;A friend and I went with my son to this restaurant We looked online before we went to find out the cost I had trouble trying to find a website but eventually came across a price of  per head When we arrived we were shown the prices before we ordered and the price was a little higher it was infact for adults and  for my son so although a little more expensive than we had anticipated we decided to stay We ordered some drinks and ordered starters and middle starters which we enjoyed We ordered some more drinks and were given the menu for the main courses I just happened to turn over and look on the back of the menu which stated there would be a % service charge My friend and I were surprised at this and felt that this should have been pointed out before we decided to order It s not that we are against making a tip that we feel is appropriate but the thought that they would automatically charge this without having made it clear beforehand didn t seem right I mean what s to stop them adding an extra % without making people clear of it We quickly looked up our rights via mobile phone and read that although making a service charge was not uncommon it should be either made clear verbally or shown to you in writing before you order your meal neither of which applied When we finally got the bill there was an amount just short of named quot other services quot so I queried the waiter on this and he explained that it was a % service charge I told him this hadn t been made clear to us beforehand and we were not happy about the deceit and please could he take this off He fetched the manager who was totally arrogant and rude but I argued the point and said as a matter of principal I would not be paying the extra % He replied by saying quot if you would have asked about it I would have told you about it quot which to me was just laughable In the end he agreed for us just to pay the bill without the added % but told us that we were barred from coming again to which I obviously replied that I would never want to come back or recommend it to anyone He also told us that because we hadn t paid a tip his staff would not be getting paid so whatever happened to the minimum wage 
negative; After visiting the G D in chipstead many times in the past with our small dogs very small dogs in the summer outside they say they are dog friendly but they are not booked in today for sunday lunch with my lovely dogs who are very well trained finished our starter of goats cheese a small piece of cheese left so give that to one of the dogs  we were then told we could not give anything left over to our dog even though we had paid for it and its not cheap and would be put in the bin anyway so they are not dog friendly so that s a lie food is ok but not that great so we didn t have our sunday roast we paid and left good luck if you visit the G D with a dog 
negative; Visited here yesterday for my nans th birthday as a party of  We had starters which were both fine except there was no sour cream as advertised just regular Mayo instead A short while later the mains arrived I had the chicken tikka Titan naan and it was awful the first time it was cold so I sent it back the second time it came back x spicier than before I think they got the wrong definition of its not hot enough I was on about the heat it was cold not the spices I don t like any curry hotter than a tikka so this ruined it for me it was really dry anyway and not enjoyable After I finished this I felt sick for the rest of the evening  Based on this we decided not to opt for dessert all of the staff we encountered were friendly but this is a second bad experience I have had in a hungry horse pub It also wasn t exactly cheap coming in at just under Would I rush back Probably not 
negative; I saw a wowcher for this place  so after looking at the reviews and the menu that was on line I decided to purchase the wowcher Omg  When we arrived it looked like they weren t open We were first in the restaurant and seated by the window  We looked through the menu which was nothing like the one I saw on line  There was no weeping Tiger which my husband wanted and the choice was very minimal I kind of thought we were given the wowcher deal menu  We chose our meal and a bottle of house wine Well I couldn t believe my eyes when I saw the bottle of wine was SIMPLY a bottle of Tesco wine Excellent margin made on that  Starters arrived prawns were ok but spring rolls tasted of oil  Then the mains arrived again I couldn t believe my eyes with the chips They were a box of McCain microwave chips and the rice was supposed to be egg fried rice with veg Hmmmm it had one peace of carrot in it and I think the rice was uncle bens  All in all it was a very very disappointing meal and would highly recommend you don t visit 
negative; We arrived for second sitting about pm New Year s Eve The DJ singer was taking a short break and the ambience seemed quite pleasant  We were shown to our table but the tables were so squashed together that I couldn t move the chair back enough to squeeze in We were given our menu s and harried to order The music struck up there was no possibility for any chatter I ordered the sea bass fillet for mains especially since it was to be served with shell mussels prawns cherry tomatoes garlic lemon and white wine sauce Well it wasn t The fish arrived scaldingly hot and served on a bed of one carrot sprouts and a burned roast potato A side of burnt chips and soggy salad was served Dessert was ice cream tiny scoops My companions had even tinier piece of Christmas pud We didn t stay for coffee since the noise was unbearable I appreciate it was a festive occasion and the loud music would be appropriate for nearing midnight but  with a meal The price tag of a head was not justified for such poor food To top it off the deposit of  pounds was not taken of the bill When we queried this we were told we only paid  deposit We foolishly did not take the receipt for the deposit Sure enough when we got home we had paid  deposit so beware always take your evidence with you since they clearly don t know what they are doing  Tip for the New Year don t go there 
negative; The kitchen closed about pm because it could not cope with the clients We were told it would be mins before it would open So no burgers for us However outside the bbq area opened at about pm to serve burgers  They were Quick Nasty Undercooked Small Tasteless and served in a Paper Box What a waste of Money  Then the kitchen reopened at about pm If only we had waited OR gone elsewhere Horrible experience never again 
negative; I never write reviews but I had such a bad experience at this place I had to tell everyone NOT to go Where to start it s over priced badly run and all the staff were the rudest I have ever experienced in London I have never had such bad service And yes beware of the service charge  After complaining to the manager I found that in fact the management were even worse and had a terrible attitude and after been called a liar I decided that they has ever heard of customer service Do your self a favour and don t go to this bar 
negative; I ve always had a rule about not eating in hotels as the food is usually sub par but tonight I broke my own rule after a long day of museums and sight seeing and decided to grab a quick dinner here while staying at the Copthorne Tara and even my low expectations were bitterly disappointed buffalo wings had no buffalo sauce and were served with a stodgy mush purporting to be blue cheese sauce minus the blue cheese my Bloody Mary was a weak vodka and tomato juice that no amount of Tabasco sauce could redeem For main the chicken Shawarma plate looked promising upon arrival but the utter lack of chicken confirmed my worst fears After days in London full of interesting outings and great meals the trip has ended on a tasteless and uninspired note don t bother coming here 
negative;I went for father s day unfortunately my Mum had booked it so the restaurant wasn t pre warned about my need for gluten free food but the waitress was fab and went to the kitchen to ask what I could have This is where every gluten free nightmare begins the chef clearly had no clue what gluten was and what it was in She came back and informed me I could have teriyaki salmon I said does it have soy sauce because I can only have gluten free soy sauce she responded by saying quot I said that to him but he told me it was fine quot clearly he had no idea about gluten after this the meal was ruined for me and I was stressed about wondering whether I was about to be contaminated I did not want to ruin my Dads day so tried not to show it but I left a message on their facebook wall hoping for a response because in all honesty I ve recommended the Hermitage to gluten free friends in the past and I would be willing to help them grow their knowledge so I am able to enjoy a meal at the Hermitage again but they DELETED the post I then inboxed them again no response Clearly they do not care about gluten free and for this reason I m very reluctant to go back Also the trip about a week before this one to the Hermitage previous to this I went regularly I got sick before the meal was out and clearly now I think it was probably I was contaminated but assumed it was not this previously because they appeared so GF friendly even providing gluten free bread So disappointing and I would urge all local coeliacs and GF people to be very careful if you do go here ask LOTS of questions to ensure you can enjoy your meal safely 
negative;I have never made a bad review before and hate doing this but What I hate more is the thought of someone spending their hard earned cash in this place I ate here when it first opened and boy has it changed This was possibly the worst meal I have ever eaten and I am by no means a fussy eater or a moaner The starter and main were virtually inedible I ordered the smoked salmon starter which was like a rancid fish jelly and the main of halibut was so over cooked it was bone dry with no flavour and the prawns in the dish had black grey heads and tails they were obviously cooked earlier in the day and just reheated The prices this place charge for the quality of the food is criminal really disappointed I honestly hate make this review but the restaurant need to up their game 
negative;Ordered food today at : by pm food still not arrived even after being told it was on its way they had just had a large order In the time we were waiting we were hearing of horror stories of reheated food hard chips and lack of food Manager pacing between bar and kitchens head in her hands I advise not to return until new ownership Bar staff were friendly but seemed cue less on till and ordering system 
negative; I can not believe how over rated Victors is the staff are rude no one is happy they lack product knowledge the individual meals arrive with huge waiting gaps I had finished my main before my husbands had even arrived I had to chase up our drinks multiple times and we were given the wrong bill at first I was looking forward to visiting but I expecting much more 
negative;This was a mid week visit The quality of food  service was average You get what you pay for with regards to the menu prices 
negative; I was at The Angel for lunch earlier today a place we ve visited fairly frequently over the last few years since moving nearby On the surface it s a lovely village style pub with standard pub grub on the menu The service has typically always been fairly slow with the occasional mix up on the food order we stopped going because of this and I misguidedly gave it another chance as it s had a bit of a refurb recently Big mistake  We ordered our food and waited a good minutes before watching two tables nearby that we know ordered well after we did receive their food Another minutes passed without our food arriving It was not particularly busy I managed to get the attention of the young lady serving our section to query where our food was and she told me she would check Another minutes later she appeared with our food  she did manage to mumble an apology but not for the fact we had waited so long for our food but that she hadn t come back to tell us why there had been a delay There was no explanation as to why we d waited so long My Dad had already tucked into his food when the waitress arrived with a plate of mushrooms that supposedly came with his meal For the price and at a local pub I don t expect Michilen star quality food but the food itself was basic at best my cod goujons  supposedly in the guise of fish fingers  were very small did not fill the crusty brown cob they came in and God knows what happened to the tartare sauce that was supposed to be in there although I did find a solitary caper so it does beg the question why we waited for nearly hour for chicken n chips a fish finger sandwich and burger The Angel has not been a bad place to go over the last few years when we ve fancied a couple of drinks But today the lack of apology or explanation regarding the ridiculous wait for our food which was not worth the wait means that I will be sticking with the Two Brewers and The Hare Roxwell who know exactly how to treat customers and serve up decent food that you don t have to wait an age for  from here Definitely not recommended  
negative;I visited this place for my lunch today and specifically asked for my udon noodles to not be cooked in any wok that had contained meat as I am vegan The staff assured me that they took great care to ensure no cross contamination occurs as all woks are cleaned after each use fine Not seconds later I see the chef using a spoon that I had meat all over it in my noodles clearly oblivious to the fact I had been told this place was veggie friendly To top it off half the veg I asked for in my dish had been forgotten So here I am writing this review vowing to never buy from here again I DREAD to think what else goes on in there 
negative; We had stayed previously but not had dinner The breakfast was great and on that basis and a look at the dinner menu we decided to invite friends on our next visit to Stroud This is a very interesting converted old convent which puts on intimate jazz and folk concerts on many evenings and there was a concert starting at pm on the evening we booked We were the second party to arrive at pm and from then on it was downhill all the way When ordering the waiter told us that one item was no longer on the menu instead of telling us when he gave us the menus  The wine list is odd with prices bearing no relationship to the quality of the wine We chose a Gewurtstraminer and a Bordeaux Cru Bourgeois After an hour and a half during which time the restaurant filled up with concert goers and we ploughed through the Gewurtstraminer the starters arrived They were paltry  prawns on a tablespoon of tomato concasse with a small amount of feta one spray of roasted broccoli which was hard and charred with a sprinkling of nuts goujons of lamb actually two small croquettes tasting vaguely of leftover roasted lamb  bean and chickpea soup which was lukewarm beans in tomato something and all amazingly expensive for what they were  After another delay by which time the restaurant had mostly emptied the mains arrived and we poured out the Bordeaux which we had not been invited to taste Describing the mains would only remind me of an experience which I would prefer to forget Suffice it to say that this chef MUST BE ON AN INCREDIBLY TIGHT BUDGET Only then did we notice that the Bordeaux was a rather than the generally much more expensive which we had ordered We decided against desserts coffee etc As we left smarting from the exorbitant bill the waiter apologised for the delay saying that the chef decided to deal with the concert goers first so that they could get out in time And as we had sat there watching our fellow diners we thought their pizzas and burgers looked pretty good But this is not a place to dine out 
negative; when I went to zizzi for lunch it took a while to be seated or greeted they said to take a seat and they would bring a menu never did or came over to ask if I wanted a drink walked out in the end and went somewhere else 
negative;Met up with some friends Thursday afternoon th Aug we have been a few times no complaints but whatever has happened staff themselves unhappy actually telling us they are short staffed and we would have to wait to get our order taken food arrived not the best only nice things where the cappuccino coffee this restaurant opened up with lovely staff and food it s gone done hill Shame really as its in a fabulous position
negative; What a joke waited minutes to be served over people in the que only one till open tables not been cleared no teaspoons waited another minutes Drinks by that time were luke warm They need to get their act together Would not recommend this restaurant over the Christmas Period why have they not got enough staff 
negative; Received an Amazon local voucher for my husbands birthday for the podium restaurant Rang to book a table this took almost hours to get an answer Eventually when they answered the phone they said I couldn t boo I had to book through Amazon Had lots of Amazon vouchers for Manchester restaurants and never had to do this Anyway contacted Amazon and told them this and they said this was nonsense and to get back in touch with podium I then got an automated reply that the restaurant was fully booked Monday night so I emailed the restaurant and asked them how we actually redeem this voucher Then got an automated email saying the message had gone to someone who no longer works there  maybe an idea to take her email address off the website Sent another one to a different email address that it gave me  no response In a nutshell don t buy these vouchers 
negative;Great location near Grantchester Meadows beautiful beer garden but absolutely execrable service We waited over an hour for our overpriced food fish and chips nothing fancy  before giving up and asking for our money back Sure it was busy but if you can t handle it don t take the orders 
negative;My husband and I have been going to Gunstool s for a number of years even recommended it to friends But oh dear service has gone off as with the food I used to say quot never had a bad meal at the Gumstool quot can t say that now we called in after a busy day travelling and my husband had a burger said he just fancied one and it something he doesn t eat often he thought it would be a bit special good quality and served with some thought What did he get but a small dry burger in an equally dry bap All though there was scrap of lettuce on the side for the McDonald s would have been better I m sure for less than half the price My food not great either So after many years of eating here and using Calcot we won t be back unless things change drastically 
negative; Pre booked a group and not given enough space The pub was half full and only two surly staff serving Food was later than we were told and cold A steak was off badly and staff not to concerned No coffee because staff member could not refill the maker 
negative;I witnessed a member of staff treat a maintenance man terrible today He was only doing his job This member of staff started shouting in front of customers in an aggressive manner  I think he is a bully and an arrogant pig 
negative; Having had a lovely afternoon in Southwold with friends we took it upon ourselves to stop upon our return trip to quot dine quot at The Blythburgh White Hart  Aware the Black Tiles had taken over the business some time last year I highly recommended the establishment  To begin with proceedings pigeon breast was ordered served on a depressed bed of the cheapest of cheap mixed salad this was just about palatable  Having not been overly impressed with the starter we then opted for the Dingley Dell Sausage  Mash Mark Hayward owner of Dingley Dell being a good friend of mine thinking what a perfect choice how can ANYONE get this dish wrong  Apparently you can  The onions rings had been fried in old oil which for the next hours refused to leave its taste from my mouth What was described as gravy which I am still trying to fathom as to what the actual ingredients were  I would really appreciate it if you could enlighten me on this matter Dingley Dell Sausages I am % certain had been cooked the day before put in the fridge then reheated Mashed Potato  The cook  who does not deserve the right to be called chef had managed to use a serving spoon previously used to serve peas to Stylishly add a spattering of them through out After a few mouthfuls we were incapable  despite being hungry  to eat anymore I promptly asked for the bill unsurprisingly neither the waitress or the landlord manager asked if everything was ok With the receipt we were given a piece of paper asking for our thoughts on the above experience Sadly there was not a box to tick which allowed one to describe the degree of dissatisfaction we felt  Stupidly I paid for the food which I am now regretting Over all this was one of the worst eating experiences I have had for as long as I can remember 
negative;After eating here spent until am throwing up I know you don t expect the best service from small restaurants and you get what you pay for buy I certainly didn t pay for food poisoning 
negative; Went with friends who had been once before and had a nice evening however our first visit will defiantly be our last The service was very poor although there seemed to be plenty of staff We had to ask for drinks and the menus There are bread sticks in packets on the tables ours however tasted off and on checking they were well out if date The food came after a long wait and sadly I can t say it was well worth waiting for because it wasn t Not the cheapest place to eat in the area a disappointing night 
negative; Went there for my birthday was only a party of two Ordered some steak platter thingy As a starter I had nachos that were nice but the main came really late like min The restaurant was EMPTY and yet the waiters were doing something  The steak came back so dry like a flip flop and the shrimps I don t know No flavors Overpriced Rude staff and a long wait Never again Oh wait I did go there again after a few months past last month on a Tuesday night around pm and got turned away because it was too  full 
negative; We arrived as the fire alarm was going off  My husband s birthday mal It was chaos all the staff were young and trying to cope without any information no sign of management We stood outside in the pouring rain for minutes and then we were told the restaurant was closing By then it was pm and we were starving I appreciate it wasn their fault about the fire alarm but it was handled very badly I then expected to get a phone call apologising for what had happened and possibly offered another table nothing  So I emailed the restaurant and they have not replied Won t be visiting again  avoid 
negative; I visted last night for a birthday meal We had to wait over half an hour for our table from our booking time The staff need some training in customer care As in they they do not meet or greet you as a customer or provide any real care There is no real etiquette within the place  you will get paper napkins and mustard served to you straight from the jar The food was ok but the whole experience ruined by poor poor service My advice is to go to the Orange Tree instead Setting and service far superior We shall not be returning 
negative; Anyone planning on going for the Afternoon Tea here  DONT The staff serving us were lovely and did very well and presenting a pretty diabolical menu in a professional and attentive manner After being sat down for minutes a huge pot of tea arrived for people with only one regular teabag in It was like drinking hot water that had been winked at by a teabag Barely touched the sides The sandwiches were bog standard and coated in a blanket of pretty depressing looking rocket The cakes were dry and pretty lack lustre And the scones were honestly gross after initially being forgotten about  The quot clotted cream quot indicated on the Old House website was squirty cream from a can and the quot jam quot was I think the syrup you put in cocktails probably grabbed last minute from the bar downstairs  Would give it a out of max So disappointing from a venue that is usually great Don t waste your money 
negative; We went as a foursome to enjoy good food My husband and I had tiger prawns  little ones appeared hidden amongst the salad leaves  Next course my husband chose haddock and chips It arrived looking magnificent On cutting into the batter my husband could not find any fish as it was a dry piece of tail He had chips on the side I ordered a vegetarian main course  oven roasted butternut squash with asparagus served with couscous and salad leaves with sour cream on the top I had thin pieces of squash very lightly coloured and asparagus spears There was about a tablespoon of couscous and a teaspoon of sour cream All very disappointing and we both went home hungry 
negative;Had the misfortune of visiting Whitmore Tearooms twice recently I had to attend on the second occasion as a guest of a friend  On both occasions the service was genuinely abysmal having to wait endlessly for our food Furthermore the waitress did her best to avoid our table and eye contact and only chased the missing dishes only an English breakfast and an omelette after an hour This was especially irritating as there were more staff than customers The food is also rather overpriced and our drinks were cold by the time the food came No apologies or offers of a fresh cup of tea Another example of customers being taken for granted Won t be returning 
negative; Sign saying wait to be seated So we waited After a few mins and no one giving eye contact I saw a female looking manager speaking to staff behind the cake counter also avoided eye contact and asked if I could sit down Yes That s it No apology The place was not busy or even half full Rude Lovely girl on service it had to get her attention It was empty Food looked good  although right with their butter When we left I started to feel ill very quickly We had to cut our shopping trip short and go home Of course you never know why you feel ill but I will never go back If any of those staff worked for me I would sack them 
negative; Thought we would give this place a try on Sat th sept arrived about one place was empty The waitress was very pleasant  quot more than l can say about the food quot  The garlic bread tasted of nothing and the main dish was just a plate of stodge which we left 
negative;The children were so excited and when they went in my little girl said she thought that this might be her new favourite place in the world My little boy has coeliacs disease so he can t have gluten Most ice creams don t have gluten in them it s cream and sugar that made a ice cream so yummy I checked with the staff and said I could spot the ones with obvious gluten in like the biscuit ones but when I asked which ones didn t contain gluten the very abrupt rude manager shrugged and told me they all had gluten in That was it as much as he would help despite my explaining I very much doubted this to be the case he rudely would not engage further in the matter and we had to leave empty handed Children s little hearts crushed How rude and lazy of the manager not just to check for us I appeal to them to change their ways and not discriminate and be so dismissive of people s needs Have a gluten intolerance shouldn t mean you can t go to places like an ice cream parlour come on guys get it together 
negative; This is the sort of cafe that is always busy by virtue of its location in the most touristy part of Cambridge As its trade is made up of passing tourists quality of food and service don t have to be up to much My boyfriend and I were here for lunch last week and as soon as we sat down we knew it was probably going to be a mistake Nevertheless we were tired hungry and of the opinion that it would be hard to mess up what we were going to order  one egg and bacon baguette and one brie bacon and cranberry panini with chips  The food came out in quick time The waitress placed the food in front of us and then practically ran away to do something else It took us another few minutes before we could catch someone s eye to ask for ketchup something which should be offered by default if there are chips on a plate Food itself was greasy and not very tasty  it looked like it had been thrown together The bacon wasn t cut up in my boyfriend s baguette And it was laden with mayonnaise  At another table we heard a waitress snap at some tourists who weren t ready to order It was incredibly rude and put me off the place even more The bill was the final insult Almost  for a meal that would cost about half of that elsewhere Avoid if possible 
negative; On arrival it was extremely difficult to find a table as they were covered in bits of food sauce and drink splashes We eventually found a table and when ordered and were made aware that there would be a minute wait We fully understand this as we are aware Christmas time can be busy so we appreciate that there may be a wait and the staff may not be on top of the cleanliness of the tables But after our half an hour wait we eventually received our ribs with spicy chicken My partner cut into the ribs and they were bright pink and cold almost as if they had just been taken out of the fridge In my eyes this is totally unacceptable and should be reported We sent our meals back and there was no apology and not a single member of staff tried to make the situation better For that reason we will never return to Oadby Owl again Cold raw pink uncooked meat is not acceptable and for that reason you have lost loyal customers 
negative;Absolutely terrible customer service we arrived minutes prior to reservation time at o clock we were still waiting to be seated even though other people had arrived after us they were taken to their tables they were regulars judging by the response of the staff when we asked the staff why we hadn t been seated we were fobbed off  as a result of this we walked out and found somewhere else to eat which isn t easy at that time on a Saturday night We have eaten there before but will not be doing again nor will we be recommending it The only plus side was the doorman who was courteous and polite regardless of who the customer was 
negative; I visited the Pippin for a birthday lunch with work colleagues as have been doing for years  But this is now the end of an era as many other reviewers have said its been up and down for ages but enough is enough We arrived in our lunch hour and were quickly scanning the lunch menu only to be barked at from behind the bar that there was a minute wait on food and then the person stomped off clearly hoping we d go away We then confirmed that mins was accurate with the barman and ordered as would not now have time to get anywhere else so rudeness ignored After + minutes and nearly the end of our lunch hour out of the meals  a sandwich and chips hardly complicated arrived but not the birthday girls food We all shared and quickly scoffed these down in a mad rush and then as about to leave the last meal came out and we asked for it to be boxed up to takeaway A small apology was offered and Greene King either need to get some proper management in this great premises or sell it and let someone else use it properly its a travesty  Very annoyed that this goes on and on  
negative; Fancied a cheeky ice cream today so thought we would visit creams in Southend Have been a few times before and the service was well below average but thought we would give it another go  Was handed a raffle ticket when we walked through the door and was told to move to one side waited there for about mins and there were at least tables to be seated before us we asked the lady how long our wait would be and she kept saying mins  People were queuing out of the Dior at this point so we decided to just get a nice cream to take away  We waited mins in another long queue and whilst we were waiting there was a lady in front of us complaining that she had waited over an hour for drinks  The assistant manager who s name was Maria was explaining to the customer that she was sorry but it was busy so it was tough basically As the lady then turned around talking to us the assistant manager then screamed at us saying that she got it alright I was like excuse me we didn t say anything  When we got to the front to order the lady was rude and didn t have a clue what was going on and when I asked her who the manager was she didn t even know After taking our order Maria came storming out screaming at her staff in front of the customers saying they had to work quicker The service you receive in this place is disgusting  they let to many people in and the staff are not trained in any level of service and no one has a clue what they are doing 
negative; We visited on and my yr old daughter  a vegetarian for years  ordered a vegetarian Heavenly Veg pizza On her second slice she discovered little balls of meat On complaining her pizza was taken off the bill As she was so upset we had to leave without finishing our meal but we were still charged for everything other than my daughter s pizza Not only was our evening ruined but my daughter s confidence in eating out has been destroyed 
negative; I have not visited the Waterfront cafe for a while but on Sunday I went there for breakfast I was surprised to learn there would be a minute wait for food as it wasn t that busy but it wasn t it was minutes The eggs were really salty can only assume they were cooked in the same pan as the bacon probably for the same length of time egg yolks were hard but the whites were wet and soggy bacon fat just sat all slimy on the plate Why salad was served with breakfast I don t know but that was dry and unappealing I guess it is weekend staff  they would do well to be trained pay attention to orders they take and pretend to have a vague interest in what they are doing It is a shame it is a lovely view but that is the only good thing I can say about it 
negative;There was a group of  Our table was booked at pm I had requested couple days before to reserve a table downstairs in which they confirmed it was As it was a large group of us we had to have the set menu As the set menu did not suit as they kindly let me change it  which I was very grateful for  I arrived pm on the dot and was informed my table was not ready and to go the bar I asked again if my table was downstairs and they said no I asked if they could change it and refused It is only after I spoke to the manager he agreed to place us downstairs Downstairs atmosphere is buzzing with nice music upstairs is very informal The manager told me at pm that a table downstairs could be ready for pm  One of my friends argued that if we are having to wait for our table we should at least be offered free drinks Manager agreed to it We ordered our drinks but they didn t come while we were at the bar  Our table was ready just after pm  So we waited around for minutes with no drinks no food no table  We finally sat down and got our drinks  the food came out The food was nice but there were little flies flying over our food We spent most of the evening hitting the flies away Not what you expect from such a restaurant  The bill came and they tried to charged us for our free drinks but when we did inform them that the manager agreed to give it on the house they then took it off the bill There was so much food left over and when I asked if we could pack it away the waiter in a very snobby manner confirmed they don t do that I told them I was against wasting food I can t believe in this day and age restaurants can be so backwards It is after a very long time I have been to a restaurant where they are not environmental friendly and are happy to waste food  On my way out of the restaurant the manager asked me if I was happy I had to quickly say yes as I had told the taxi to pick us up at pm and because of the late start I was walking out of the restaurant at pm we had to rush our food and cake cutting  The taxi driver was annoyed we were late  which I understood My sisters and friends who have been before in small groups have confirmed the service is great Therefore I would only not recommend it for large groups  they just don t know how to cater for such groups 
negative;We went for a quick meal on a Sunday and were greeted with some absolutely diabolical service The starters were okay but after another minutes of waiting we were served cold pizzas which were both the texture of rubber I could go on and on but I ll leave it at that DO NOT go here unless you re either absolutely starving or nothing else is open 
negative; Absolutely disgusted with my experience at Mikado s Decided to pop in one lunch time with my Mother I am months pregnant and she was going to treat me We didn t stay past the starter  I ordered Grilled Dumplings a simple dish you might think but no The dumplings had raw pork inside of them I noticed after having eaten of them and spat the th out We sent them back to the kitchen straight away and the chef said it was because they had just come out of the freezer We weren t charged for our food but I am now sat at home feeling nauseous hoping that I don t get food poisoning for the sake of my unborn child DO NOT RECOMMEND 
negative; Would not recommend this place at all  Overpriced food Tiny portions poor quality  the curry I ordered come with maybe a teaspoon of curry sauce at a ridiculous price Although it s fun watching your food come on a rollercoaster that s the only good bit We weren t the only people complaining at the time either  Don t go here the other food places round the park are brilliant 
negative;Went for a midweek treat The food I had was very bland My husband on the other hand had to request cutlery and a finger bowl for the mussels in his first course Then had to request a new napkin and cutlery again for the nd course Thought that would have been basic customer service It wasn t even as if they were busy only other tables full They were all diners so not rushed off their feet Don t think I will go again for a while but will give them another chance 
negative;I visited the Faulkland Inn with my husband and two other family members after visiting the website and reading the menu  Both my party and myself were looking forward to tasting the carribean cuisine as we ordered our drinks and settled ourselves with the menu  but what a disappointment when we read a very basic menu without any of the dishes described on the website Did we have the wrong menu Were we in the wrong pub Unfortunately not  it appeared that the menu had been changed from the exotic to the mundane In fact it was so plain that we left without eating and went in search of something a little more interesting than a couple of steaks and a vegetable lasagne 
negative;I frequent this cafe on a regular basis and I have always know it to be a friendly atmospheric cafe Drinks are served quickly with good customer service usually The last few times I have been in for my morning coffee I have been served by a lady who clearly lacks customer service there is no smile I just get grunted at quot your drink will be on the end when it s ready quot this is not what I have grown to expect every morning when usually I get greeted with a smile I don t get this service atall now I walk in and the warm atmosphere is non existent there are new faces over the last few weeks so I am putting it down to lack of training or clearly can t be bothered time will tell either way I m very disappointed the cafe clearly is not being managed correctly 
negative;I have eaten breakfast and lunch so many times at the Olive Tree I have lost count Always fabulous service always great food Took the whole family there for Mothers Day  of us  and it was the most awful roast ever Cold food that would have fitted on a saucer Total cost Complained to the manager who said sorry which I didn t feel was good enough so I emailed my complaint but have not even received a reply Thought it may be a one off so returned for breakfast Questioned where our food was after minutes and apparently the order hadn t been sent through to the kitchen Waited a further minutes for a cold breakfast with rubber like scrambled egg The table service does not work in the day  should only be for evenings This makes me very sad I loved this eatery and I cannot say how disappointed I am that it is now so awful What a waste of such a fantastic place 
negative; Not sure why there are so many good reviews on here my husband and I found the food to be absolutely tasteless We was totally disappointed We chose this due to all the great reviews and being our honeymoon weekend we wanted something special it really wasn t We asked for Garlic bread for starter We was told they don t do garlic bread What Italian does not have garlic bread  Yet again let down we went for an antipasti starter it was yet again so boring and tasteless looking at the ratings ok here people are easily pleased Don t wast ur money  The service was good friendly Helpfully pleasing staff but the the food NO  
negative;We have been here so many times and enjoyed our meals but last night was definitely the last time When we arrived it was apparent they didn t have enough staff to cover the busy restaurant and only of the staff seemed to understand English I couldn t believe initially that my husbands ml bottle of strong bow was over and as he has ceoliac he doesn t drink beer or like spirits so for him this was his only option When we placed our orders for our main courses we specifically asked if the stir fries came with noodles to which we were told by a girl whom clearly didn t understand yes When the mains arrived I was left with a bowl of beef in sauce with no noodles and then had to wait minutes after prompting the waitress again to receive them at which point my friends had well and truly finished eating When we asked an older lady waitress if we could order deserts and more drinks she looked at me with such frustration as if it was such an inconvenience at this point we were pretty much the only customers left but it was only about We all laughed about the experience and all decided that after many visits there we won t be giving another  for poor service and meals that don t show up We own a business on the high street and always shop local and support our neighbours but next time we will try another restaurant  Sorry 
negative; Well my Dad has always loved this restaurants atmosphere but frankly I feel there is none I shall list the horrid experiences I have had at this pub from our finding of it in : Everything is always off and yet is never taken off the board so you can never know what you will end up with Even if you book three for a roast only will receive a full dinner The food has no real flavour it is like a school dinner cooked but not worth eating This is a long one last time I went not only did the starter take mins to come out and the main an hour and fifteen but there was a very loud mouthed argument in the kitchen no heart felt apologies and hairs amongst all we ate To top it off when eating roast chicken I wondered if there was any kind of cranberry jelly or sauce to accompany the dish The waitress gave me branston pickle This place is a joke 
negative; Myself and a friend went for early an doors meal  the restaurant wasn t open we had to sit in the public bar area The food was a carvery we both had a carvery sandwich we choose are meat and they went off with it for at least minutes when it finally arrived it was luke warm 
negative;The restaurant does not have air conditioning which is not normally a problem but it was stifling in there today We all of us ordered off of the two for one menu The food was adequate my husband s salad was served warm with a slab of steak dumped on top so presentation not great One of the kids meals did not come until we chased it up after all of us had ours for a good mins When we got our Bill only of the meals was given for free when we questioned the waitress she said that the jacket potato was not part of the two for one deal When we complained that the menu was very misleading as we all ordered from the two for onemenu and nowhere did it say that the jacket potato where not part of the deal The waitress said she would ask the manager to come and talk to us after waiting for the manager for mins with distressed children we paid and left in disgust Needless to say we will never go back again and we will give all marstons a very wide birth 
negative; Very rude service No consideration for the client Never going back The food was not as good as they say 
negative; Just visited this coming all the way out from St Albans and regret it NOT worth it The service was disgraceful we were tending by the rudest waiter or who was completely miserable and disinterested Asked for the berry pancake specifically asked if they would be fresh and with no jam  he said yes Out came a huge mess of watery jam filled with boiled sour type berries  extremely horrible and sloppy Could not eat it I had the corner of the pancake where it managed to escape the watery jam The waffle my friend ordered was even worse tasted of dough Service was included in the bill but it was non existent from the moody waiter  I m never going here again and going to tell my friends and family all to avoid 
negative; The food here is really stodgy greasy and fatty It s not good quality either The venue is like a worn down dingy s night club It s in dire need of a revamp The service is good but this place is not my first choice ever and only somewhere I reluctantly go to when a friend invites me Not quite sure why anyone raves about this place 
negative; Visited The Red Kite today for Sunday lunch Pub welcoming nice atmosphere but snail service We arrived at  and was seated immediately We waited  minutes for our drink orders to be taken however our waitress was lovely  minutes later our order was taken It took a further minutes for our pre starter to arrive  bread and oil and then after our plates cleared nearly another minutes for our food Now it may seem we are impatient but when surrounding tables had been seated served and had the bill in the time it took us to come to the end of our mains Not great Then we had another minute wait for our plates to be cleared and even longer food our bill to come and pay it We understand Sunday lunch is a busy time for restaurants especially having worked in various restaurants myself in the past but for me this is just not good enough Sorry but we shan t be returning here which is a shame as the food itself was lovely 
negative;We come here quite often and always have the sizzling fillet steak Ok it s not cheap at  per person but it is always cooked to our liking and we have always found the service to be excellent and the staff very friendly  Our last visit however was awful We arrived at around pm and were seated quickly and our order was taken promptly Our food arrived quickly and that is when it all began to go downhill We ordered our usual sizzling fillet steaks and to begin with it tasted delicious Unfortunately half way through eating mine I discovered what I can only describe as a white vein of fat running through the centre  It took me a while to get the waitresses attention  not her fault I hasten to add as she was seating a large table of people She quickly brought over another waitress and I showed her my steak and told her that I could not chew through it and also demonstrated that it was difficult to cut she apologised and took it back to the kitchen saying she would speak with the boss I waited for her to come back to tell me another steak was on it s way Simple right  ER WRONG The waitress returned looking extremely embarrassed with my original steak and informed us that her boss who we found out later was in fact the owner  had said there was nothing wrong with the steak  Clearly in a bid to prove this he had cut my  steak into about fifteen pieces so that it resembled a plate of dog food  The arrogance of this act and his failure to rectify something so simple astounds me especially as I wasn t actually complaining about the way it was cooked it was just a a bad cut of meat  This is the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have EVER ENCOUNTERED We asked for the bill and were charged full price which we paid in full  We will not be returning 
negative; Oh my word where do I start hour wait on food The worst steak I have ever seen sent back twice Complained only to be told that the regular chef was absent and a bar guy was cooking the food Asked for a sandwich to bridge the gap advised hour wait and not to bother  Never again will I eat here 
negative; We had a  voucher and we had not understood this was for main courses only They had several choices for  and a few at over We had starters totaling  plus x  meals We also had sparkling water  x wine We paid an additional but felt conned as the food and presentation was just not the quality required for the prices charged They just thought we were awkward customers when we queried the bill 
negative; I arrived at Roast  Conch at : am on Sunday having made a booking the day before It was the first time I had chosen to eat there and it will most definitely be the last From the minute I stepped into the building I knew that it would not be the enjoyable Sunday morning brunch that I had intended My booking was for : am but after waiting minutes at the door we simply seated ourselves After a further minutes I approached one of the nearby serving stations to obtain menus When going up to order it took some time for anyone to even acknowledge that I wished to do so I enquired as to the portion of Lobster which was priced @ The server had no idea and said that if I wanted he could ask one of the other members of staff I just went ahead and ordered  After a further minutes another server came over to our seat and informed me that my chosen meal was no longer available She was probably the most polite of all the staff as I was asked whether I wanted an alternative However she then told me that I could sort out the difference in payment when I paid at the end I informed her that I had already paid as was required when I ordered the food I then ordered an alternative meal It then took almost minutes for our coffees to arrive and a further minutes after that for the food Portions were extremely small for the price for full English and definitely not worth the money I saw at least one other couple get up and leave as they could not obtain any assistance service When we left no one even acknowledged this and plates cups had not been cleared away All in all the worst breakfast and some of the worst service I have ever received Very disappointing 
negative; I requested for the egg from one salad to be swapped out for beetroot which was on another from the specials menu They told me flat out no rude and without customer service slills Won t come back  EVER 
negative; Popped in for Sunday Lunch as I would usually unfortunately the waitress was extremely rude telling me no buggies in the restaurant I said I would leave the buggy in the car  it seemed really she was referring to the Baby as this didn t seem to suit either I was however offered the alternative o sitting out in the cold with my baby instead So kindly declined and headed to the Stile Bridge down the road for better food great service and happy staff I won t bother with The bull again if my family is not welcome I am not 
negative;Visited today for lunch no service whatsoever stood in front of the hot food counter while staff came and went helping themselves to food and exiting without a word to our party of four Asked a chef if there was anyone to help us shrugged his shoulders Finally someone appeared and we chose a butternut squash dish with roasted vegetables and grilled chicken with same vegetables We were told to help ourselves to cutlery there was none Went to the pay desk and asked about cutlery and were directed back to where there was none We asked for two coffees and nothing happened The assistant on the till had just started working there this week but had not be trained to use the till We had those two dishes two coffees and a glass of wine came to An outrageous cost for inedible food The butternut squash still had its very thick skin on it and the chicken was raw in the middle which we returned All the chicken portions were then immediately removed The whole place was shambolic no one in charge and manned by untrained staff The concession is run by Benugo and they should be ashamed of themselves What visiting tourists must think I cannot imagine If you are visiting the Science Museum take your own food or eat in some of the excellent restaurants close by in South Kensington 
negative; Arrived at resturant at pm on Tuesday st Febuary with my husband and two children about ten other diners were in An oldish guy sat us straight to our table asking if we would like drinks after ordering three cokes and one tap water we were told to go to the bar and get our own tap water out of the jug  Five staff walking round not doing a thing other than chewing gum My husband arrived with my very warm glass of water whilst the barman was making jokes on a mobile phone behind the bar The food was warm with very chewey chicken not nice to say the least although the cucumber was okay My advice would be dont wast your money on putting staff out by being there 
negative; I would not recommend this restaurant  Ordering our meal and getting served with drinks was really slow Tables had not been cleaned and it took asking twice before anyone appeared to fix this All the other tables around us remained with dirty plates and glasses on too Two meals didn t appear with the others and when asked where they were the waiter had to return to our table to ask what the missing meals actually were Everyone else had finished eating before the last meals appeared but the waiter didn t bring cutlery and we had to walk to the bar to ask for them The woman who brought the cutlery who appeared to be assistant manager  was unfriendly and had no word of apology 
negative; This is by far the worst place I have ever eaten me and my boyfriend were the only in this place we ordered a burger and a panini With my boyfriend being a chef we know how long food takes and the quality of food after We made our order my drink was forgotten it then took minutes for our food to come out when it came my boyfriend burger was cold my panini had no cheese when I asked for some My panini also had extremely small strips of chicken and about diced pepper I can t even explain how sparse it was After we had waited so long it was appalling I couldn t sit and wait any longer for them to fix it we had to leave in the end and for our money back for our food It would have been nice to have some apology drinks instead of making us pay for them such a disappointment after I have been dieing to try this place 
negative; Visited this restaurant Sat th Oct the lager was definately past it s sell by date and when we told the staff we were asked to leave although we were two couples in our late fifties our opinion was totally dismissed needless to say we won t be going back 
negative; Myself and colleagues visitied this restaurant for lunch As regular visitors to the bar we thought we knew what to expect however we were disappointed After being shown to our table we were not asked whether we wanted any drinks instead we had to call a waited over to order drinks We ordered our food which consisted of a starter to share and a main course each After we d finished the starter a waiter asked whether we wanted him to order our main course now  we assumed the food order would have all been sent to the kitchen at the same time Anyway after a long wait we chased the order up and were told that it had actually been lost but that it wouldn t take long to come which to be fair it didn t after this point  We had been told that we could have free deserts as a good will gesture however due to the delay we did not have time for that  When we received the bill a colleague mentioned that we were unhappy with the food delay to which we were told that it was a busy time When we called the general manager over he was even less bothered by our delay and stated the same that it was a busy time and that infact the restaurant was one of the fastest in Canary Wharf We explained our issue was that the food order was lost and that we could not accept the desert due to time so would like some kind of discount from the bill however we were told bluntly no this was from the general manager I explained this was not acceptable and that I would like his name to speak to head office to which he advised he managed this restaurant Haz and Tas After being told by the GM that he was very busy eventually the service charge of  was removed from the bill  I am not convinced that he is the owner of restaurants however if he is and this is how he deals with customer complaints then I am shocked  All I can say is that if you have an issue at this restaurant and have the pleasure of speaking with Kanenber the GM s name then don t hod your breath for a customer friendly resolution to your issue  Needless to say we will not be visiting this place again for food or drinks We work in Cnary Wharf so will also not suggest this place for any future nights out or lunchs but then again Kanenber probably couldn t care less 
negative; I Visited last night and thought the for cocktails were great Myself and a friend ordered Barracuda cocktails which were lovely until i discovered a fly in my drink didnt think too much of it until i then discovered another flies My friend then found a few flies in her drink We took the drinks back one bar maid was apologetic but the one that served us seemed quite rude about it It seemed like this had happened before as she said it s due to the weather They remade our drinks without the flies and when asked if our next ones would be on the house the bar maid said no i ll give yo a shot I think this was disgusting service and we really should have been given our money back or given another set of drinks for free BEWARE  
negative; Had the misfortune in chosing Debenhams Bedford Restaurant for a light snack not too sure where to start  greeting from staff  zero  minute wait even though nd in queue took staff mins to place order of coffee juice croissant and fruit salad waited mins for it to arrive luke warm coffee arrived first this was followed to mins later with a microwaved croissant this was greasy and nuked Several minutes after this the fruit salad arrived with the juice The fruit salad comprised of almost frozed fruit oh not forgetting the odd brown apple core and very dry segments of orange it appeared to have been prepared the day before or longer We had to ask passing Chef for cutlery Then realising that we had to go back to the counter to ask for napkins where we were duly issued with one  The Chef that was bring the food out had was wearing dirty whites  All in all a total waste of nearly a tenner All together their was customers in total in the restaurant  will not be going back if this is the service when trade was slow God help those who turn up when it is busy or was the emptiness a sign of customers have shown there protest 
negative; Wont be coming back to this restaurant for a meal as had to wait for over hr to receive food and when I told the waitress that I had a item missing she said she would get it for me but mins later when I had finished there was still no sign of missing item so me  husband left saying that we wouldn t be returning for food as I was sure I received a childs portion but paid for an adults portion unfriendly staff who seemed that they couldn t care less about customers I will be telling friends not to visit for food unless they want a long wait and unwelcoming staff Its ok for a drink but that is about all 
negative; Went into this lovely country pub righit opposite park wylam no welcome off barmaid actually made us feel as though we d interrupted her day  When food was presented it was unedable The baguettes which the surly barmaid tried to convince us was the way they came from the bakers  Well I would sack the baker  They were uncooked almost doughy an when we complained the surly barmaid then said I ll refund you this time We don t make a habit of ordering food for five people to Not eat it and send it back We had children with us We went away hungry an annoyed not a way to run a business  
negative; Afriend suggested we go to this place under the impression it was under new management as the Name had changed to Sands Diner sadly after we ordered the chef came out who was the same man who I had argued with on my last visit there I ordered a melted cheese and mushroom baguette with onion rings and chips and my friend ordered the fish and chips we had kids meals for our two girls To cut a very long story short the food was very basic very bland cold the fish was sloppy the baguette down one side was actually burnt to charcoal effect and the chips tasted like they had been cooked in the same fat from the last time I went there my baguette was given to me with onions in it which was not on the menu or asked for but before I said anything the waitress put it in front of me and said  quot I don t know why he has put onions in it I didn t ask him to quot  then walked off I was shocked that she had not only bought it out to me burnt but it wasn t even what I ordered The mature waitress was nice but sadly didn t really make a huge difference to our experience they had no baby changing facilities and when asked we were told to change the nappies at the table next to us we were advised that by law they do not have to provide baby changing facilities I don t know how accurate that is but you would think they just would and certainly not in the place where people are eating so after the horrendous main I don t know what possessed us but we chose a dessert of sticky toffee pudding the bowls actually came out with dead flies and a layer of dust around the entire edge of the bowls When I went to complain a young waitress asked what I wanted and I noticed she was on her way with two dishes so I said I d wait but she put the food down and asked me again I told her and almost immediately the chef awful man came out asking what my problem was The young waitress remained where she was with the food she had been taking out for almost minutes in the end during this time the Chef examined our bowls took them away and asked us if we wanted a replacement we said no thank you a refund would be better After counting his till money he then gave us the refund of the desserts 
negative; A colleague and I went on a rare lunch together so thought we d go where work FMB has taken us many times and is near the office therefore making the most our our lunch hour On arrival the bar was busy and we ordered half portions of the main courses as we know they are quite large normally and we know they do allow this We paid for meals and drinks and sat outside with spoon no minutes later and seeing people eating who d ordered after us I approached the bar which was unmanned and I waited a further minutes before seeing ANY member of staff The staff member said they d just had to do a meal serving upstairs and that ours was next  At no point at ordering were we given an ETA for our food nor warned of an excessive waiting time I sat back at our table and a friendly female staff member noticed we were without food and offered to chase it up for us Knowing our lunch hour was nearly up we decided to cancel the order and instead see if we could take a sandwich out Although we got a full refund inc drinks and apologies it has dented my opinon of the eatery which up until today was one of my preferred establishments We were both looking forward to a warm cooked lunch and left with cold sandwich and crisps the fact they were on the house made them taste slightly better than they were as you could tell they were thrown together in a rush into a soggy baguette  The nice lady who processed the refund even shouted come back it will be sometime until I step foot in the Strickland Arms again  On returning to the office the fiance of my colleague said he had tried to phone several times to pay for our meal but on four occasions the phone was picked up and put down without any word spoken so he d given up 
negative; Me and my partner came here for a meal last night and it was TERRIBLE Firstly the staff were all miserable looking when it came to serving and introducing themselves We had to wait for over an hour between our starters and our main meals both of which were sent back  and this is not acceptable when you can clearly see the serving staff stood around laughing with each other with seemingly nothing better to do As for the food  awful We didnt go in expecting gourmet meals as we like the normal deals but know what to expect  decent but just your normal pub grub food However whilst there were no apparent problems with our starters the wrong one was brought out and in the time it took to bring out the correctone my partner had already finished his We can let that go  mistakes happen But when both main meals came out cold and my partner only had yes chips on his plate and my gammon was inedible more like chewing cardboard than anything that had a bit of taste and thinner than a slice of bacon  we couldn t accept that and asked to speak to the manager to be informed rather rudely that they were unavailable and the second manager would have to do The yuong gentleman that came over was very unhelpful and although eventually offered to refund our food we later heard him standing behind the bar stating that quot we were too picky and could shove our refund up our  At this we walked out and will NOT be returning her again It s a shame as the pub itself is a lovely family friendly place in a good location  but the management seriously need to sort their staff out their chefs and as they were quot unavailable quot to talk to us themselves it seems Awful 
negative; Popped in for cake and tea on way to tube The place was wrecked Tables needed clearing dirty shelves empty staff minimal I needed the loo and dare not go for fear of what I might find Very disappointing 
negative; I rang to confirm my sons would be child price as they are I took photo I d and they still charged me full price  Arguing with me in a full restaurant even though the lady I spoke to on phone confirmed she had told me it would be child prices  The toilet are disgusting stay away from this place 
negative; By far the worst dining experience I have ever had the misfortune of participating in Picture this: a soulless hollow building with thumping dance music and the atmosphere of a car showroom The floors were filthy with chunks of food and sticky residue all over and the seats matched We had to change our table due to there being chunks of lettuce and a piece of mystery meat on one of the booth sections None of the tables had been cleaned and were full of sticky marks from drinks and even more chunks of food The exceptionally blunt cutlery was also filthy with food residue My experience was unique in the respect that I can honestly say that I have never been out to dine and had to wait to have my drink with my starter before We had been eating our starters for all of minutes before our greasy mains were brought out As the drinks took so long to arrive I decided not to get another and instead took advantage of the water from the dirty dispenser Never have I eaten in a Pizza Hut before where I could quite literally see bubbles of grease on my Hawaiian pizza I forced myself to eat one slice and I wish I hadn t bothered for it left me with heartburn We didn t stay for dessert All in all an atrocious experience and extremely disappointing as we are not Eastbourne locals Rest assured this particular Pizza Hut will never get my business ever again  especially considering that this shambolic experience cost us over 
negative; A friends th birthday meal although pre booked had to wait mins for our table we were invited to get a drink at the bar The bar was deep  honestly with person serving and then they didn t have any lager Finally shown to our table which hadn t been cleared and left us standing while they cleared it Table was for  there was of us and they squeezed us on Didn t come and relay table we had to get cutlery ourselves from another table hardly any food to choose from most things were empty and didn t get replenished Extractors not working so we were literally choking in smoke by the end  and then they over charged us and we had a real to do in order to get it sorted 
negative;  Terrible and rude service Invisible portions per portion Overpriced you need to get at least  portions not to feel hungry  Too spicy not Peruvian at all 
negative; Went in on Sunday night not one single person in We were shown to a table without even anyone opening their mouths Menu s placed in front of us and then staff walked away No drinks or nothing We left immediately after being challenged with an abrupt WHY  Went to Pizza Express instead where you get great service This place has gone downhill massively I used to go often last year and it was always busy and food was great A miracle needs to happen to sort this place out A star food hygiene rating the other month as well Wouldn t be surprised if it goes bust by Xmas 
negative; Having ordered half a roast chicken I was quite surprised when it arrived within  minutes Obviously had been pre cooked It had an awful tang to it and tasted worse When asked by a passing member of staff if meals were okay I replied that it was awful The man then went on to clear other tables When paying the bill I was not asked if we had had a nice meal Obviously not wanting to invite complaints I certainly will not be going again and rather than recommend it I will be doing the opposite by telling people how bad it was 
negative;We were told the one big table we could have sat at as a group was booked so we were split over tables No one turned up to use it the long table while we were there The food was appalling luke warm at best and served on cold plates so became cold very quickly The berry sundae desert was frozen solid and had obviously been taken straight from the freezer Feedback at the time was ignored and no reduction was offered when the bill was paid The Christmas crackers were cheap and nasty All in all a very disappointing Christmas party 
negative; I rang a few weeks ago to book a table for lunch and was told by the chap on the phone I wouldn t need to book for lunch as they always have tables free not a promising start I turned up today to find decorations for paddys day in the windows and a sign saying theyre closed for refurbishment nobody seems to be answering the phone very disappointing to drive all the way out from chester for nothing 
negative; Went here for a friend s th birthday Admittedly we were a large table of  but it took nearly an hour for them just to come and take our order only to be told to not bother ordering starters as the kitchen was too busy We were told to order a few plates of nachos to share and even these took another minutes to arrive How long does it take to melt some cheese on a few tacos The food then took another minutes to arrive and whilst i have no complaints about the food if a restaurant cannot cope with a large booking or a busy night then they should not have taken the booking in the first place Had to ask for a glass of water at least times before receiving it also The service really affected our enjoyment of a special night and i would never go again or recommend it to anyone else 
negative; We booked the set Xmas meal for people last week Starters were nice The main course started to arrive mins later Firstly the meat steak salmon turkey  We waited mins and nothing further arrived I asked the waitress if we had any side orders or just meat today mins later the veg arrived At this point we made a start as our food was getting cold Another mins passed and again i had to ask the waitress for the rest of our meal mins after we had recieved the start of our main course we finally recieved mashed potato At this point  of my friends had finished their main course which consisted of turkey and veg We then realised that we hadn t recieved any chips For the third time i questioned the waitress who immediately asked the chef His reply  chips are not on the menu  At this point i was fed up and angry whilst eating cold steak warm veg and hot mash Yes steak and mash  After i had finished my cold course i went to the bar to look at the set Xmas menu which we had paid  per head for And as i thought it states that chips are included Fourth time i spoke to the waitress who said it s a different chef and he didn t know that chips were included  What an absolute joke Chef is obviously incompetent He she can t delliver a main course on time and doesn t know what the set menu includes And surely you would of thought the waitress would know what the set menu includes as she isn t new I told the waitress i wanted to make a comlaint and expected a discount The manager wasnt available so we were offered one bottle of wine between of us Or she would take my details and ring me the following day Which i agreed was more suitable I am still waiting for that phone call days later I will never visit this pub again And i have made sure all of my friends and family are aware of the way me and my friends were treated The chef is incompetent the waitress is just as bad and the management are obviously not managing the establishment well at all Especially as they can t even use a telephone to discuss and correct terrible errors 
negative; To say I m disappointed is a complete understatement The lack of service I have received on two separate occasions at this Harlow restaurant was disgusting On one occasion I waited over hours and on my most recent visit I waited a ridiculous hours plus and both occasions hadn t even received our meals  the manager was rude and next to useless they used reused pieces of fruit from other drinks in my cocktail as I ordered a non alcoholic drink yet my wedge of pineapple was dry as a bone and stunk of alcohol DISGUSTING 
negative; unhappy and not bothered to ask that would sum up the staff food well i nearly broke a tooth on my starter it was obvios it had been forgotten in the microwave main was cold and staff did the best that thay could to avoid any eye contact we then were left with a pile of dirty plates for mins when i asked if thay could be taken away the responce was not to my liking  we will not be going back i think it is so sad that any eatery should count on name alone 
negative; Food and surroundings may be good but watch when you pay Was told a transaction had been declared void but discovered when checking bank statement it had actually gone through twice 
negative; My daughter and I regularly use this venue for lunch but no more we went today and I ordered a tuna ciabatta sandwich and was told we have run out of tuna It was only  no fish fingers either i was told that now there is no choice of breads as before as the sandwiches are now pre made to save time but we still waited the same amount of time for them to arrive I was told that my cheddar and red onion sandwich would come on a subway like roll but it came on soggy horrid white bread  My daughter ordered a mozzarella and pesto sandwich which was supposed to be on a baguette but that also came on soggy white please Mrs owner go back to your original menu before you go out of business i complained to the gentleman on the till and he assured me a lot of the regular customers were very unhappy so why change a menu that works could it be cost i have recommended this place numerous times but not any more  
negative; Terrible service and overcharged  Cold coffee No spoon No fork Side dishes not delivered and we were charged for them DON T GO THERE 
negative; We have in the past visited The Halland Forge Restaurant for Sunday lunch both on our own and with Friends However the food t on Sundays had gone down hill  There was a time that we were unable to eat there on a Sunday as it was so packed  As we drove passed to day there was a notice outside advertising a new Chef and menu We though we would give it a try  The food was dreadful and worse then ever the chef who served us seemed to be the old one  The beef was dry and I could not eat it the roast potatoes were Frozen and the vegetables medico and the Yorkshire pudding was flat and taste less  My Partner had turkey which was the only part of the meal he enjoyed  We are so disappointed and fill conned by the sign outside  In fairness when we complained they removed the Beef and got out a fresh joint and I was offered another meal  but declined  Not a place to stop at Have they got a new chef or is this just a ploy to win back some of their old customers  wont be going again 
negative;Ongoing problems which their HQ are not interested in solving Food and drinks are very overpriced for pot of tea for two boring cheese sandwiches need I go on Cutlery dirty service slow GO SOMEWHERE ELSE 
negative; Mostly been there with a party my meal was alright but each time I have had a meal there at least one member of the party has had a complaint about their meal either not what they ordered or badly cooked Each time there was a complaint there was no argument with the staff either money was refunded or a free meal was served I believe the Chrismas Party bookings were a shamble one party was tripple booked They eventually sat down for the meal The meal I believe wasn t good 
negative;Had set lunch  Huge amount of food but the taste of all three meals were terrible How you can cock up chicken chow ming But noodles burnt and taste of oil in my mouth all day horrid Friend asked for satay chicken got sweet and sour and chicken not fresh worse dining experience for ages If your a student great for the price but watch what your having 
negative; We had a dinner last night the first thing is when we asked about if the pizza is homemade or not the waitress was shuting us telling that the pizza was homemade sorry but we are italians and in London mostly of the restaurants are not homemade ingredients we were waiting more than minutes to have a seat later on waiting more than minutes to place the order after to call times the waitress I went to the toilet and the waitress was crying  the waitres all of them blond hair and the manager of the restaurant italian man speaking with two blonde girls next to us without stpo and flirting with them obivously at the same time that we were waiting to place the order  the waitress came very rude with our pizza  calzone was empty inside maybe they forgot to put the ingredients  into  finally the dessert was very funny when we asked about the flavour taste of the cupcakes ans she said  I dont know  when we left the manager still flirting with the two girls while the rest of the staff were working hard and crying at the toilet I dont going to come anymore 
negative; Slow service in a busy pub both pints of lager were fine We had the fajitas which were overcooked and a pizza which was still raw in the centre  We mentioned this to a waitress who then told a member of bar staff but we didn t even get an apology from anyone Shame about the food and service as it really put a dead end on our evening Read in another review on TripAdvisor regarding there being no manager present and once again there was no manager present during our visit either as we would have liked to have mentioned our food and service issues to them Won t be returning any time soon sadly we re very disappointed 
negative; We have been here two or three times before and always had excellent food and service We brought a large party of friends for a celebration meal We waited and waited and waited we had to ask for staff to come to take food and drink orders several times We did not get our main course for two hours the food when it arrived was very good but the indifferent attitude and rude comments made by the staff have put me off ever going there again My preferred restaurant will now be the Dilshad where the staff are always welcoming and well mannered 
negative; To say the food came quickly is an understatement I know when ordering food in a busy pub you sometimes expect to wait but our order arrived that quick there was no way it could have been fresh My husbands steak was that tough and fatty the poor cow must have died of old age There was no mustard available and no onion rings yet my burger was piled with onion rings soaked in cheese sauce My grandson s hot dog seemed fine at first glance but when he picked it up to eat it there were hairs on the plate We didn t finish our food or drinks and I felt disappointed in my birthday choice 
negative; to say this visit was a shambles would be an understatement booked a table for a friend s th birthday table wasn t ready for over an hour our party was eventually clumped together on a table in the corner that was cleary a cloakroom we were stood sat over people for over an hour drinks orders were messed at one pint the bar staff asked us how to make a cocktail we d ordered  after an hour and a half we had poppodoms we received no apology just excuses eventually we walked out so I can t comment on the food 
negative; Vile food  Came last month and had awful rubbery pizzas and today got served with this crap  Absolutely disgusting 
negative; Well nipped in for a quick drink and a snack Wished we had never bothered  fruit juices  glass of coke  soups  cheese and ham on toastie Equals  and one grumpy hubby The soup was a few cup of socks threw together The toastie was cut Into squares Hardly any cheese and no salad The service is so slow One woman doing drinks because she doesn t trust anyone to help and shouts at the waiters to pass the milk The older guy who I thinks owns it is straight from faulty towers Save your money and your sanity 
negative;Visited with my sister on our last day of a short break in Hunstanton We know Jo s was a more cafe style of eating then other restaurants we had been to but there was still a standard we expected  It started well with a friendly waitress taking our drink order which arrived promptly  soon she came back to take our main order  this was when things started to go down hill We both order ribs but that wasn t available so my sister had scampi  I ordered lamb only to be told that wasn t available either so in the end I went for chilli  We ended up waiting for mins for our food  when it arrived my sisters chips were barely cooked the scampi was in some kind of yellowy batter and really chewy My Chilli looked good until I started to eat it  found it was so hot it was inedible  had a very strange after taste Both of us had coke which was very watered down When our waitress came back we told her the problems we had she looked surprised and the only comment was on the scampi which she said tasted different because it was gultan free as far as I recall there was no apology  and no concession on the bill While we were waiting for the bill we both used the loo and saw our waitress I smile as I walked pass  barely got a reaction from her  my sister said she just glared as she walked by  Nearless to say we left no tip  went next door for a nice ice cream  Lesson learnt when away used TA to choose your restaurants 
negative; I went to this restaurant a few months back I complained by email after the meal and also made it clear on the night we weren t happy The food took forever and was cold when it came By then we were all starving The manager decided to reply to my email rebutting all the points I d made Apparently it was our fault that the food took so long because two of us are coeliac and therefore had requested gluten free pasta  this is on the menu so why should that be a problem Also blamed the small kitchen really not my problem I m pretty sure even if it had been piping hot the food would have been no good Wont go back 
negative; Visited Soho bar with a group of friends for a birthday and would never go there again We waited minutes to get served at the bar and a further minutes to receive our drinks Understandably we knew it was busy but the rude manager topped off the awful experience After expressing our concern whilst waiting for our order the manager quickly became aggressive and increasingly rude  the customer is always right is clearly an expression that this manager who is supposed to resolve a problem has never heard of An apology for the long wait wasn t even received The worst customer service we have ever experienced 
negative; DO NOT DO IT  worst place I ve ever eaten Food was awful customer service was non existent and restaurant was filthy The food was warm salty and oily I asked for some of the dishes to be reheated and to my astonishment they were nuked in the microwave behind the cash till in full view of us and others The food was piping hot and like rubber when it came back Couldn t even be bothered to say anything at this point  We refused to pay the service charge and couldn t wait for our nightmare to be over 
negative; Sagar used to be brilliant Good food good delivery times But The last times we ve ordered from them they ve estimated around hr delivery but last time it took  hrs and tonight it never arrived We rang twice to chase it up after hrs and were told: its on its way Then : its definitely on its way ring us if it doesn t arrive in mins Then they rang us and a very rude girl said they had sat outside our house for minutes and we didn t answer  They said we had a white door  wrong So they got the wrong address maybe but didn t phone us on the number they had at the time Maybe they have changed hands we will be avoiding them from now on We have had to order a v late curry now from somewhere else as Sagar wasted our time Why did they lie  I m so hungry 
negative; We visited for a family celebration Have known about this restaurant since it first arrived in Sheffield so was looking forward to tasting some genuine French cuisine How disappointed we were This is certainly not a place for the discerning diner but more suited for those who eat with their eyes I don t understand how barbecued chicken wings fit in with French cuisine Huge mounds together with equal quantities of garlic bread and crudites were placed on the table as appetizers The crudites were far from elegant just great big chunks of vegetables My husband and I had ordered scallops as starters So let down  looking forward to big juicy scallops gently sauteed in butter and garlic but we got tiny prefrozen ones in a tasteless sauce My husband quite liked his mullet main course I opted for the Prawns Provencal The Provencal sauce turned out to resemble and taste like gloop No finesse whatsoever Totally inedible  just had to pick out the prawns which I have to say were large and juicy I glanced towards other members of our party who had chosen in the main steaks or the lamb dish Each of their plates seemed to be covered in a brown version of my own gloop sauce Mounds of boiled to death vegetables were left on large platters for diners to help themselves Finally if I had room I had anticipated being able to close from a selection of my favourite desserts  creme caramel crepes creme brulee I asked the waitress what was on offer  chocolate fudge cake I think was the reply I don t think anyone from the establishment has ever set foot across the English Channel French cuisine it isn t Finally please get the paint brush out the interior was totally shabby  not shabby chic tho  and in urgent need of some TLC Not a even a hint of scene setting background music What a pity 
negative;Disgusting food not fit for human consumption Dirty glasses Dirty tables Dirty cutlery Dirty bathrooms 
negative;I feel such a party pooper Having read some great reviews my friend  I went to Jekyll  Hyde today at pm It wasn t overly busy and there were two staff serving behind the bar As described by a few other reviewers the staff one male one female didn t acknowledge us We stood  waited for about minutes with absolutely no indication that they d even noticed we were there There were a few customers but no palpable atmosphere Eventually I asked the bar man a question which was curtly answered I then tried to order some drinks to be told he wasn t serving We d probably been waiting for about minutes by this stage so we left Such a shame we were so looking forward to spending an afternoon at The Jekyll  Hyde but being ignored and treated rather rudely it s highly unlikely we ll return or recommend 
negative;It is difficult to know where to start this review I would love to be able to say something positive about this place so I will start with the location it is lovely with a beautiful view over the Thames Sadly this is where the positive bit ends My partner and I met my adult son here for Sunday lunch to celebrate his birthday We are all dedicated foodies and I had done my research on Trip Advisor and decided to choose the restaurant because it had good reviews and was in the perfect location We were greeted warmly had our coats taken and were shown to the bar to wait for our table in the restaurant and that is really the last bit of good service that we experienced The service in the dining room was beyond shocking it took us over hours to get through a course lunch for of us The starter was fine but the main course  served minutes after we had finished the starter was served on hot plates but the food was cold so had been standing for a while waiting to be served we all had to return ours as it was inedible We had to wait for another minutes to get a warm main course which was definitely not worth the wait Needless to say the gap between finishing our mains and being served our desert seemed to go on for ever as did trying to get a bill at the end of the meal We eventually gave up and paid as we left the restaurant The person who took our payment apologised for the service and deducted the % service charge without us even asking They had received several complaints that day All in all a very disappointing experience and we will not be returning any time soon and we will be sticking to the other top class restaurants in the area in future  I
negative; Myself  hubby and two children decided to give The Fleece a try Monday th May and now wished we hadn t wasted our time  We were directed to our table and then we were just left to fend for ourselves We had to ask for someone to take our order ask again for more drinks and had to ask for the dirty glasses to be removed from the table minutes later we still hadn t got our main course no starters were ordered I asked twice where the order was and twice I got a different answer  minutes after we arrived we decided to leave the Fleece and take our business to the restaurant in Stainland which by the way was fantastic as always 
negative; We walked into the Inn to the bar Manager owner shouting at his bar staff and running around like a headless chicken it wasn t even that busy but we got a seat and and got some drinks and all seemed fine We had our dog with us he s a good looking lad quite large and often attracts attention Everyone that walked passed gave a him a stroke One of the bar maids accidently kicked him on her way passed not her fault he was in the way a bit On her way back she apologised and gave him a pat No harm done Pub really quieted down and the bar manager was still running around he hopped over the dog and made him jump So he sat up Bar manager very aggressively said quot I can t be doing with that I ve got enough to worry about without worrying about a dog You ll have to leave if he s going to bite I felt him go for me quot  He didn t he simply sat up and touched him Our dog has never hurt a fly At which point the bar manger ran passed again agro our dog barked at him i ve never seen our dog bark at anyone before  He must have felt that he was being aggressive towards us He said quot Can you get that dog out of here quot so we we stormed out He said quot sorry but he went for me and barked at me quot I explained that quot he would bark if your aggressive to his masters quot The bar maid appologised on her bosses behalf Obviously he s not a very nice person We won t be going here again Which is a shame We a regular visitors to Croyde 
negative; When the staff finally stopped chatting to themselves and acknowledged me I made my order I attempted to pay and was told cash only no signage to that effect so I had to dash to the bank to get cash out  rather an embarrassing moment The pricing was slightly lower than Costa  next door and I d purposefully walked passed Costa to go here and support local businesses however as this was the nd time I d waited a good few minutes even for an acknowledgement by staff too busy airing their dirty laundry with each other at a volume that made eavesdropping unavoidable I m afraid I won t be going back  far too many really fantastic local independent coffee shops  eateries to waste time and money here Avoid 
negative; Where do I start I know it s a chain and you go there knowing what you re getting but our experience was pretty terrible Had a birthday voucher offering a free main and free bottle of prosecco Lovely We showed the waiter the voucher no problem apparently Then endured a terrible bruschetta  soggy tomatoes soggy non toasted low quality garlic bread Then waited nearly an hour for average pizza s Had to ask repeatedly for water left waiting to order dessert  went to pay the bill and the small print on the voucher meant prosecco only for a table of  Whilst the manager kindly agreed to give us the prosecco no free main no debate If we d known the prosecco wasn t covered we d never have ordered it One waitress towards the end was lovely and pulled it together and whilst you don t expect perfection still paid  for pretty rubbish food and dreadful service Never again Shame pizza express over the road was being refurbed 
negative; Went on a Friday night with friends and had a table booked for We waited half an hour to be seated When we enquired about how long we would be waiting we were ignored by two members of staff and then the manager spoke to us and said quot it s a busy Friday just wait by the bar quot  no apology They sat us in the function room off the main restaurant which was quite bizarre and we had another long wait until the food came A friend ordered seafood linguini and could not eat it as it was so salty I asked to speak to the manager at the end of the meal and explained why we were unhappy with the service and the salty dish His response was to ask quot are you finished quot before eventually apologising quite insincerely  They did take bottles of wine off the bill but the whole experience was terrible The manager needs to learn some customer service I will not be going back Ever 
negative; Over the years this particular Wetherspoon has gone down hill Surely head office can see this in the takings The food is hit and miss more misses even though most of it is microwaved how can you get that wrong  The management have nothing better to do than constantly move tables so that staff are forever running around like headless chickens with plates of food going cold because they don t know where the tables are The staff then ask customers at tables if they have ordered lets say icecream as an example the customer has ordered icecream and says that was quick  meanwhile somebody else had ordered the icecream half an hour before the customer who it was given to  Both management and staff stand around chatting and ignoring customers are they there to work The toilets are so called checked every hour yes the staff walk in sign and walk out This pub actually needs complete new management and staff the area manager in particular who does a very bad job does not know the area or people that frequent this establishment and keeps putting tables in bad positions making it like an obstacle course and a fire hazard Why do management staff take so long to clear glasses and plates throughout the pub I can understand it when it is busy but not when there are hardly any customers My final note wouldn t it make sense to have a floor plan in the kitchen so that staff know where the tables are this would have to be changed frequently to keep up with table movement 
negative; Well what a shame I ate here a couple of weeks ago with a group of friends The service was good however the food was very poor and over priced Will not be coming back 
negative;As locals we have been visiting this restaurant since it opened  even during the lean winter months when it was pretty empty The food has usually been good but the serving staff are always changing Last night we booked a table and our food was served the young girl asked if we wanted any sauces and as my husband was eating dover sole he said some tartare sauce would be nice The girl went to the kitchen and returned to say there was no tartare sauce  my husband said unbelievable and with that she left us The two owners rushed to our table and retorted that their member of staff was in tears in the kitchen they were not a fish and chip shop so tartare sauce was not the norm  the lady said she could go and get us some if necessary The husband  we nickname him Basil as he does get out of his tree from time to time  and have watched people leaving the restaurant on a few occasions became aggressive leaning across the table at my husband The result was we left and will never return  shame nice food but poor service and a dodgy attitude 
negative; Just going to keep this short and simple Don t waste your time eating here Staff are not interested The food came out at different times to everyone else  It was shoddy 
negative; Throughout the meal we were ignored my bf chair was kicked when they walked past times and one of our starters were forgotten about which we brought up and they didn t seem to care and it wasn t even busy  At the end of our meal my boyfriend complained to the waiter who proceed to walk away without even acknowledging our complaint about the poor service that we recieved When the bill came we decided to pay three quaters of the bill We brought the bill to the bar and explained our reason for not paying the full price for the meal The other waiter manager behind the bar ignored our complain proceed to walk in front of the bar and square up to my boyfriend in a threatening manner and argue saying it was not up to us to decide how much of the bill was paid and that he would call the police After more argueing he finally let us leave the resturant and said we we barred The way we were treated was disgraceful and unprofessional and I can safely say that is the worst service that I have ever encountered 
negative; If you enjoy food from the freezer to the deep fat fryer then look no further  Beige food Then this is the place for you Why not try something more adventurous like the special house curry  chicken with a jar of Uncle Ben curry mixed in The only good thing about the meal was the side salads which were freshly prepared 
negative;My family and I have been coming to this restaurant on many occasions over a number of years This last visit was the worse so far Plates were dirty with greasy finger prints My pork belly was burnt and the tried to hide it When I told our server it was burnt and I couldn t eat it He took it away and brought it back to me in a takeaway box My son ordered the calzone for desert it was tiny and only one of them It was dry and he couldn t eat or his ice cream which they gave him a fork to use Very disappointed with our meal and the service Won t be going back that s such a shame 
negative; Me and my boyfriend ate at BHS cafe during out lunch break at college  The service was slow workers where also rude and abrupt  Originally I ordered a jacket potato but they didn t have any Next I decided to get a sandwich they all contained cheese which I medically cannot eat So finally I settled for lasagne and a chocolate muffin  My boyfriend got fish and chips which was cold the fish had more batter then fish The muffin was dry and bland Frankly the tea was the best part of our dinner 
negative; We sat outside where there are tables I ordered small meat pies and two cakes The menu I had looked at outside was not available downstairs The Victoria Sandwich and the chocolate cake were stale and dry As we ate we looked at the window display The display of cakes presumably there to entice people to order party wedding cakes was caked with dirt There were dirty streaks on the icing dead flies and live ones in the window and a grey dust coated the display If a food inspector sees this I would think the shop would be shut down It is a complete disgrace and made me really regret ordering anything I have given Bryson s my custom for years but this is not good enough People expect more now and there is a lot of competition in the Lake District There is no excuse for dirt and stale cakes 
negative; The food took minutes to arrive the pub wasn t busy  and it was cold and tasted horrible The cutlery and cups were dirty The salt was rusty  see photos If that s Eton mess I ll eat my hat Do yourselves a favour: enjoy the beautiful setting and then walk right on by to enjoy the canal walk 
negative;After being recommended by a friend we went to try out this restaurant We were very disappointed The food was very greasy We ll just stick to chop Sui house in the future 
negative; What you are paying for here is essentially a floor show where chefs can juggle knives and food All the main courses are cooked haphazardly on the same surface so everything ends up tasting of small burnt bits of whatever else has been cooked The food was bland other than the taste of burnt food Just a gimmick that I would not wish to experience again 
negative;We stopped here for coffee and cake as it looked like a nice place The decor is good and it s well set out When we entered not one of the waitresses we walked past acknowledged us It s a small thing but goes a long way to make the customer feel welcome We sat down and eventually another waitress came over to take our order Without a smile or a greeting she took our order and disappeared The drinks arrived and we asked for a glass for the Coke She dumped a glass on the table  it still had juice in it from a previous customer Our cake never arrived If we were awkward or demanding customers I d understand it but we re not I noticed not one of the staff seemed to enjoy themselves and I didn t see any of them smile with each other or the customers I wonder if they enjoy working there 
negative; We live down the road from the well known restaurant The Harvester  From eating in different cities and only hearing positive feedback we thought we would give it a go  The nightmare began in October  when myself and several friends went for a birthday meal Whilst waiting minutes for a table being provided with shocking customer service from our waitress the food order being wrong food arriving at different times some had finished and others was just arriving  being over charged and general lack of communication between the staff we decided we would not return  Having moved into the new year with the attitude new year fresh start we thought we d give them another shot  What a bad idea this was on this winters Sunday evening myself and friends turned up at he restaurant around pm we waited at the door for roughly minutes before being greeted and asked how many of us there were We got told a minute wait and that was funnily enough ALL we got told in our favor we had been before so knew the routine and went and took a seat at the bar  can I note no menus were handed to us  To our astonishment we only waited minutes before being called up for a table still no menus  Between the of us we had a lot to talk about and before we knew it minutes had passed but to our disappointment we had no recognition from ANY of the staff even to hand us the long awaited menus Eventually its now pm we got greeted by our waitress Renata more on her later  drinks orders taken finally We then placed our order all deciding on the gourmet oz beef burger the lightening then struck the realization hit the waiter after we had ordered There was no beef available no beef available in Salad  Grill bar  we understandingly changed our order to the chicken There is a salad bar at the restaurant which entitles you to a free salad bowl with your order Renata failed to inform us about this but again we knew the routine  very disappointing It is now pm and the food arrives  cold and thrown on the table by Renata without a whisper From being in the restaurant from pm i m sure you can imagine we are all starving so we quickly tidy the plates off So now this is where the shock horror of service really takes place  pm is approaching and the finished plates knives and forks crossed which indicates a meal is finished is still on the table despite eye contact with of the other waitresses as Renata is nowhere to be seen and EVEN the dramatized putting on coats situation STILL no clearing of plates At this point i am at the end of my tether so i ask the waitress who is cleaning other tables which have no customers on over to get the bill I out of chance just look around the room and there she is there is Renata cleaning her section which can I note has no customers in but just dirty plates on the tables she is oblivious to us  her customers The other waitress then signals her over she comes over clearly annoyed we distracted her from cleaning her tables and says are you finished Baring in mind we finished the food minutes ago She takes the plates and gets us the bill who said we didn t want desert Without a mention of desert we are just tired and want to get out of there Whilst taking our card payments from all of us there wasn t a word spoken which just sums up her lack of communication skills in a front of house job Money was taken and off she went not another word we didn t know if she was coming back or that was it so we took it upon ourselves to leave  Not a word from any of the staff on our way out which is usually the case in a restaurant  either from the bar staff of passing by staff I suggest The Harvester have a training day and train their staff what communication is and how it should be used as customer service is CRUCIAL in hospitality before they lose all their customers 
negative;sadly after being recommended Serendipidity by the local vicar in my area both myself and my grandchild walked away utterly disappointed Although the quality of food was very good the staff or should I say one particular member of staffl let the place down I have since found out to my horror that it was the manager I shall not be returning to Serendipidy unless they get a new manager that is as i believe she really does let the place down Perhaps I got her on a bad day there really is no excuse however for bad manners 
negative; A would suggest people avoid this Pizza Hut  certainly not like some good ones i have eaten in in this country and abroad Long waits for the food and poor service  the waiters seem to compete with each other to the detriment of the customer and the manager doesn t appear to have a god grip on the situation  total chaos to even get in past the queues waiting for takeaways  and they didn t sound happy Next time I d be better off across the road at the local Big M  and I hate fast food 
negative; Got turned away by the bouncers  I asked was it ok to go in for drinks The biggest guy said yes and was letting us in but then the small guy deciced he didn t like us and said no  We are in our s We d only had a couple of drinks so we wasn t drunk or acting foolish We was really looking forward to it as i d heard alot about it of friends Just who the hell do these people thnk they are playing God and making judgement  I was quite shocked as this has never happened to me before and i have been to most top restaurants and bars in town I feel dissappointed and let down  How can one bouncer says yes and the other says no : 
negative;I would never recommend this place to anyone whilst in Blackpool we wanted to eat something but we didn t want something too fancy expensive nor did we want to eat fast food so we opted to go to Nando s  big mistake I ordered a chicken wrap with a side order of spicy rice I was stunned to see that my order was not only the worse and bland tasting chicken wrap I have ever seen or tasted  in fact supermarkets do better wraps and far far cheaper than this place but my side order of rice was  LITERALLY  one spoon full of rice the rice dish no bigger than centre of my palm see picture attached  very similar dish to the once that you get your dip sauces in a Chinese  Thai restaurant And to top it all  THE PRICE  OMG for the smallest  worse wrap in the world I wish we would have gone to Costa across the road  where the wraps which by the way they are amazing only cost What a disgraceful and extortionate place  NEVER AGAIN 
negative;Just felt the need to review a dreadful experience my family and I had last night at Reds We had traveled from Shropshire with family to celebrate my sons birthday We chose Reds to eat due to its informal atmosphere as they do not take bookings we popped in as we arrived in town at  The floor manager gave us a  slot We all agreed this was fine as we would be able to have a few drinks before dinner On our return at  there was great confusion around our table they pushed some tables together but could not fit us all in We where then shown to a long table next to the kitchen door and bar service area Staff seem to be standing around laughing and generally chatting  They ignored us for about mins until my son asked one of them if he would take our drinks order He took the order and disappeared we waited and waited and still no drinks My son then asked a waitress if she would take our food order We had agreed that most of our party would like ribs and chicken Eventually the waitress came over and said quot sorry guys ribs and chicken are off the menu we have none left quot  The drinks we ordered still hadn t arrived and basically no one cared less By now it was still no drinks So we left feeling very disappointed hungry and fed up the night was a complete disaster No one cared less at Reds we did try to speak to the management but there wasn t any one available If they would have told us as we where seated that these key items where not available we would have probable left then rather than sitting for minutes trying to get some service This left it late to try and get a table in another restaurant Customer service was absolutely appalling the Reds Team would benefit from some customer care training as they just didn t give a dam The team should visit Hickories in Chester to see how they work in a co ordinated customer focused way making a night out there and enjoyable and welcoming experience So thanks Reds you ruined my sons birthday night and lost customers in the process who would probable have ended sending around  plus tips  
negative; Booked a table for tonight arrived half an hour early as was in the area checked with lady on the front desk to see if this was okay she said quot not a problem quot and showed us to our table  Half an hour later still no waiter waitress had come over to our table completely ignored Was serving tables all around us but not us Left after half an hour once seeing other tables who had come in AFTER us already being given their drinks and food orders being taken The Lady at the front desk just watched us walk out without saying a word  Disgraceful customer service Or should I say lack of it avoid 
negative; Booked a table for people at pm only to arrive and had to wait nearly minutes to be seated as they open at pm and it really is like a cattle market everyone pushing to get seated before everyone else Poor start to the evening It didn t get much better I understand it s a buffet restaurant and people choose what they have to eat and help themselves but what I didn t expect was all the starters and mains to run out within the first minutes of finally been seated the service to get food replenished was adequate at best Trying to get a drink was impossible as there was not enough staff on Finally to top it all off what little food we were able to get was then tainted by the fact there was hair in it We explained this to staff who just shrugged it off and needless to say it was not a pleasant dining experience and one that we will not be repeating in a hurry 
negative; First trip to the island and fancied a coffee and a bite to eat We saw this pub in the distance and aimed for it We had high hopes until we walked into the wrong section of the pub and told it was for hotel guests only The guy at the bar was extremely rude and unwelcoming and when we asked if they served food he pointed to a blackboard which offered different types of baguettes We asked if he could recommend any restaurants nearby and he shrugged and said he only eats in Plymouth Clearly not a local My daughter also gave the hot chocolate out of  
negative; Came in for a quick bite to eat noone seemed to be in charge and people waiting everywhere for various orders Looked at where the food was being prepared and was greeted with a dirty floor and staff with nasty aprons Everywhere looked grotty and so I left without food 
negative;Been to the Reindeer many times food and service second to none until October new chef new menu  Why fix what was not broken Quality of food still good but quantity would not keep a newborn baby alive and very very expensive Sorry but won t be going back to reindeer now  Repeat custom will be lost with many of the regular diners Bring back the old chef and menu Used to be our favourite special place to dine not any more Such a shame  
negative; We had a family get together at this restaurant and as we were a large group we had to chose in advance from the set menu The food was dreadful My brother in laws steak was so hard he couldn t cut it The pork belly was a lump of fat the linguine contained one prawn and bits of chorizo and was so greasy it nearly slid of the plate the chicken dish was dry and the fries more like crisps No one in out group ate all their meal even the starts left a lot to be desired The best part of my meal was the cheese and biscuits They put bread and olives etc on the table which we didn t order but silly us presumed this was complementary as we were such a large group then had the cheek to charge us We were supposed to return the following week for another get together for those that couldn t attend but we cancelled and decided to go elsewhere The food was over pieced and the drinks more so You d of thought they would have made more of an effort for a party of or more Don t bother with this place 
negative; Worst breakfast bacon hard mushrooms done that much was crispy sausage burnt and everything swimming in fat it was awful 
negative; there is little choice for food for a night out to this Surrey Quays Leisure complex  Food quality is poor salad bar was so basic there are only the cheapest vegs available 
negative; I cannot begin to describe how terrible this restaurant is It s basically a nightclub with some tables squeezed in The staff acted like bouncers aggressive rude and lacking any of the skills needed to be a waitress waiter Firstly you should be told by the bar above the restaurant at the time of ordering that you cannot take your drinks down into the restaurant we had just bought bottles of wine hence some fast drinking and smuggling of bottles into bags and trousers Then as we proceeded to make our way down to our table we were stopped at the door by a bouncer with an earpeace and one of my party told to remove his Christmas glasses and me my Christmas head band with antlers on  We actually thought he was joking but no he was deadly serious So ok as we descended into the restaurant we thought that maybe it was the kind of establishment in which our attire would lower the tone  How wrong we were As already described it is a huge dance floor with loud music with and roped of areas and some tables squeezed in along half of the floor You could barely hear yourself think let alone talk It was filled to bursting with lots of large parties at the bar and we were unceremoniously ushered through crowds of people blocking our way to the table Now we come to the food Truly awful The charcuterie starter was a plate with bits of Parma ham chorizo and olives all of no higher quality than anything you can buy in Tesco Very disappointing Then our main course fillet steak which was actually cooked well on a plate with wait for it cabbage served with new potatoes What Cabbage and steak This menu had obviously been designed to be as unchallenging for the cook as possible HUGELY disappointing I will however give top marks for the lovely pear tart served with ice ƒ??cream which judging by everything else I can only assume is bought in and not made on the premises  Please all I can say is that under no circumstances should you go to this establishment unless you like overpriced food served by bouncers A truly awful experience 
negative; We strolled by and thought the outside seating would be a nice place for lunch What a mistake We waited an awfully long time for our order to be taken and then another minutes for our lunch to arrive It wasn t even busy I ordered the goats cheese and fig bruschetta and my husband ordered the Vietnamese Salad His salad had small piece of chicken for  and my bruschetta was so hard I couldn t even cut it with a knife We told the waitress we were not happy with the salad but she kept on walking and said she would be back She never did come back I finally went inside and told her we were leaving Never going back 
negative; Greasy food took ages to arrive got the order wrong in various different ways and we were ignored by the manager when we complained Was also totally over priced for the quality of the food it was worse than most cheap takeaway food meat seemed processed 
negative;Went as a pre booked group of for pm on Sun th Oct our table was not ready We were given menus to look at outside the building due to lack of space Eventually we were invited upstairs to find we had a table for and one of  when we had booked table space as a group so we could chat The tables were re grouped into one large one but were obviously an inconvenience  Our waitress was young and it was her th shift and she did not have the experience of looking after a group booking It would have been better if we had an experienced member of staff with the young girl shadowing rather than her being overwhelmed Two meals came out sometimes after the other had started to eat She had not been informed of the special at the beginning of her shift and had to go and ask  I asked if I could have the chicken breast with salad as a main meal and was told no we do not have salad yet there was salad with the starters I do not think the menu is suitable for a family with younger children but then I would not recommend the venue for a family Better for adults in s or s  This venue was chosen as part of a long weekend visit to Bath but it capitalizes on the visitors who are unlikely to return rather than local people Tourists are obvious the main money spinners but the standard of service was poor the building and staff cannot cope with demand The museum is two rooms with exhibits not well labelled looked after or staged Another sign of the owners not coping and the business out growing them It make have been very good in its early days There is a need to step back and re assess  The Bath Bun ƒ?? was so disappointing It was a large white bread roll not as described on the website quot part bread part cake quot  very miss leading ƒ??the Bun as used as a trencher in the main meals ordered was a quarter of a Bun with the meat slapped on top and the vegetables served around  Definitely over rated not worthy of its Tripadvisor s certificate of excellence  Tilly s next door is highly recommended 
negative; Ordered food online at Finally arrived at When I rang up at  to ask where the order was the first person I spoke to said it was still being cooked I asked to the speak to the manger who said the order was out for delivery so someone was lying  When food arrived taking mins to be delivered yds if you believe the manger it consisted of bland curry and cold rice  Never again 
negative; Just had worst service pizza ever After waiting nearly hrs The pizza finally turned up in a horrendous state looked like it had been kicked about the street before being shoved into box  Absolutely ridiculous delivery person just looked blank and didn t know what to say Not impressed at all 
negative; Food is very bland not a good menu takes ages to order and actually get served wouldn t even think of going there on a weekend as it s impossible to get served Prices are very reasonable hence being so busy 
negative; Went here whilst holidaying in Cornwall came in at about pm with my husband children and dog girl who sat us wasn t overly friendly but we overlooked it Ordered the kids meals and I had a starter all was nice but no one came over to ask how everything was or even if we enjoyed it once we had finished My husband ordered the pulled pork burger and we ordered a side of triple cooked chips when it arrived the chips weren t triple cooked and there wasn t any pulled pork in the burger it was just chunks of pork He told the young waitress who when she came over turned her nose up at our dog whether she was frightened of dogs or just because she is a Staffie I don t know but she was sitting there very well behaved she had no right She said to my husband yes that isn t pulled pork and we don t have any triple cooked chips left so made you these no one told us this she sent it back that was it no apology he then told the other waitress as we wasn t sure what was happening not to worry about making another as its getting late and our kids were tired she said ok and said sorry and would take it off the bill the bill came and the young rude unfriendly waitress then made a dig at my husband and said we was just about to bring your burger out but you said you didn t want it my husband then told her no I told the lady we didn t know what was happening and that its getting late and not to worry about making another she then went on to say that she told us that they was making another one which was a complete lie and then carried on to say that my husband was lying I would never call a customer a liar and especially when that wasn t correct anyway she then stormed off when my husband told her he didn t like to be called a liar We then went to pay for our meal but the girl just gave us the money back rightly so really when you have such awful service the food we had was ok overpriced for what it was but for me its the customer service that means more you can get a nice meal and nicer meals than that anywhere in fact we did a few days later It seems they were nice to the locals but not to the tourists not a way to run a business at all 
negative; As a regular it is really frustrating to find time after time that there is no body on the bar staff seem to hide round the corner and you have to go and find them There are some that are very friendly and give good service and know how to pull a pint Others unfortunately are rude don t care don t know how to serve a pint and tonight the beer was served in dirty glasses Not how I expect a Marston Pub to be run 
negative;My husband went here in March for a meal and drink before we went to The Central Hall to see a concert As it us very handy As it is just round the corner So very handy Meal was okay Pretty average
negative; The only nice thing in this place is the music It s dirty The tables are covered in marks and the sugar bowl in front of us was filthy The staff hang over you obviously wanting you to leave and we were only half way through our drinks I won t be going back 
negative; You don t usually expect much from an all you can eat buffet but this was something else As none of us could even finish one plate it worked out as quite an expensive meal We didn t leave hungry but that was because the food was so awful we lost our appetites completely Will not be returning 
negative; Went for a light lunch Service non existent Had to ask several times for drinks Couldn t care less attitude Don t bother much better alternatives Why pay money to a place that can t be bothered Will never return 
negative; My husband and I went there for the first time As soon as our bums were on our seats a waitress came over to ask what drinks we wanted We hadn t even picked up the menu Eventually when we did want to order it was confusing as it s not like normal restaurants where there is one waiter per table These waiters are constantly hovering around you so you don t know who to order with This one waitress ended up staying with our table for most of the evening We ordered Bruscaiola as a starter and I specifically pointed to the name on the menu whilst she was taking the order in case my pronunciation was incorrect But she brought Bruschetta instead and said she heard Bruschetta not Bruscaiola Fair enough mistakes happen She took the Bruschetta back and we waited minutes for the Bruscaiola  We ordered our mains and zucchini fritas as a side and asked if they do an aioli sauce as an accompaniment to side dishes She said yes and asked which pasta we would like with it I knew she totally misunderstood as we didn t want a third main dish which had aioli in it we wanted it as a side sauce I told her to ignore the request as it would be impossible for us as a couple to eat main dishes You d think that would be common sense right Anyway she came back later and saw my husband s glass was empty so asked if he wanted another drink and walked off really quickly My glass was empty too but she didn t offer me another drink I called her back straight away and had to ask for another glass of wine When ordering the dessert we decided to share so I asked her to bring two spoons with it when I placed the order She did this correctly All of the above were the only requests we made Throughout this whole dining experience I found this particular waitress s service very odd and difficult to work with but I was always polite and didn t make a fuss as I was out on a meal with my husband It was only when we left the restaurant that my husband told me that the waitress was all smiles to my face and was pulling faces behind my back as if she was cursing me He said this happened on many occasions including when we left the restaurant He didn t tell me while we were there as he didn t want the experience to be ruined even more That was the first time I have gone home from a restaurant feeling angry as I didn t feel that I was a difficult customer It completely killed my mood for the start of the weekend As a customer living in London you d expect some respect from waiting staff Instead I felt targeted and bullied If I had known in the restaurant I would have made an official complaint with the manager as staff like that should not be waiting on customers I m NEVER going there again and will recommend to everyone I know to avoid all Il Mascalzone restaurants The food itself was not fantastic but okay It was also completely over priced for what it was It worked out to  per head and this was with us sharing the starter and the dessert Not cheap considering it s not central London or not a classier restaurant 
negative; Visited today with my mum and daughter after we had been bowling We looked through the window and the food looked ok so we gave it a try Wish we hadn t  On entering the lady who served us was quite friendly but said we had to pay adult price for my year old daughter Tried the soup first which consisted of tofu and that s pretty much it Moved on to the starters which were all freezing cold Asked the staff if they could warm it up for me n they took my plate from me and told me to get something else which I did but everything we put on our plate was cold  Didn t try the puddings but the choice was limited and unappetising I complained and was told that if we didn t want to eat there we could just pay for the drinks which we did with no arguments There was only one other table occupied at lunchtime and now we know why We went to Crown Buffet on Gower St which is MUCH better  I would never return here 
negative; I went with my family for a meal the staff are rude and the Bar staff are even worse I had been advised by other people that this Resturant was badly managed but decided to go and see for myself Dont go 
negative;Went for set party menu some veg and some non veg Only brought out non veg menu and when asked for veg menu told should have asked on booking This was not the case as told to ask on arrival Portions were very small and some on menu never materialised at all Drinks very very overpriced and Waiter managed to tip tray and cover one lady with nine cocktails which did eventually result in a reduced bill but not an overall pleasant experience 
negative;Was going to have lunch with my friend and arrived here it was not busy so sat at a table with my year old twins gave them a dairy lea dunk able while we could order a lovely salad and enjoy the lunch without them screaming for food the man behind the counter started shouting that he does not have other food in there and I was to remove them as they were taking up valuable seats he was so rude and aggressive they are years old if an older child I could understand but they would not eat sandwiches or salad and were being so good Then he asked us to leave  It was really a horrible experience and didn t see the issue on a cold Tuesday lunch time when my friend and I were going to spend at least  each wouldn t recommend it horrible man  Also needs to put clear signs up stating this as didn t see any 
negative;I ve tried to like this place as it just around the corner from my house but every time I come away disappointed Sunday was the last straw we walked in and were the only customers The bar staff completley ignored us and carried on cleaning after approaching the bar to order breakfast she was incredibly rude She then proceeded to ignore another person that came in The food arrived absolutley stone cold  Baring in mind we were the only customers at the time in there there is no excuse Eggs benedict tastes awful cold is it too much to ask to be served on a warm plate  My bf also had the big breakfast which was again cold  I will never come back here again 
negative; Due to stuff beyond my control I found myself having to eat here On reading the menu I thought maybe these kind of places have caught up with real food  I was wrong  I ordered something posted as Super food pasta  For super read super some time ago maybe As long as English punters with little taste  even less ability to complain frequent these places they will continue to survive  God help us 
negative;I went for a meal on a relatively quiet Friday night with my partner I was pleased to book a table at such late notice but was unfortunately met with disappointment after disappointment after we arrived After waiting a while to get drinks we sat outside until our table was ready After ordering from a limited choice of options on the menu my girlfriend ordered the chicken dish in a mushroom sauce and I had the duck and noodle dish  we were so disappointed after our wait that my partner couldn t stomach two bites of her meal as it so was bland and so dry that she found it off putting Where as my duck was described as roasted  but came out a grey beige in colour which was well overdone to what I would consider being restaurant quality the noodles on my dish tasted as if they had been a cheap packet of super noodles from the supermarket for p  Disillusioned with are main courses and wine selection we decided to not bother with desert and instead spend out money else where 
negative; Went on Sunday Mother s Day whilst on a visit to Cleethorpes we waited minutes for our drinks and just over an hour for food for adults and child We assumed it was because the food was good what a shock the haddock was tasteless with gooey batter and chips rock hard The bread and butter turned up well after and after asking for it times The hot drinks came separate and with milk cartons instead of fresh milk and hot chocolate had a lump of powder in the bottom of the glass The place itself needs a total revamp and customer service training They need to visit steels and improve immensely otherwise they will lose their business A total let down to say the least 
negative;Came here for Fathers Day Lunch as family just moved to the area and are now on the look out for a good roast dinner This is definitely not the place to go The food was awful tasteless and cold Portion size was small You d be better off going to a Toby It was just embarrassing I think for for course you could at least have fresh ingredients and a bigger plate the stuffing balls were not cooked properly and you can tell it s the dry mix meat was incredibly dry no gravy so had to wait which meant our like warm lunch was cold by the time we reached the table Such a disappointment I can t believe I paid for it but I just wanted to leave 
negative; We have been to this restaurant  times the first visit the food was ok after that it just went down hill the woman behind the bar was the rudest person and no I would not recommend desperados 
negative; Had a staff dinner there we all left disappointed and hungry overpriced the food was terrible it took minutes to get starters and hour after starters we got are main We got there at : I dident get my main intill : mind you I have a six year old so I was the worst the staff was rude and when we got are food we got it at diffrent times people were watching other people eat Moral of the story very expensive food was horrible rude staff and we left feeling hungry I wouldmsay dont evergo there unless you want to throw money in the bin 
negative; Firstly we were seated on a table next to a door that led to an adjoining part of the restaurant which meant staff were in and out of the door and it ruined the ambience The service was extremely slow and our waiter was visibly put out when we asked for more sandwiches as they were not offered One of our party had a strawberry allergy and no alternatives were offered Very dis appointing for the money we paid The only good thing I can say is that the little hand made pastries were delicious 
negative; Have been here many times in the past however September visit for a family birthday saw the whole evening a complete disaster from poor service to very long wait for food poor quality of food and cooking and when tried to complain the duty manager refused to speak to us Complained in writing got voucher off to give them another chance Revisited and virtually the same experience even after being greeted by the Manager and his guarantee of being treated like VIPs  Long wait for food most meals were very substandard and the chef forgot to cook one of our parties meals  Much apologies given offered a free drink or bottle of wine but nothing would have persuaded our family to stay any longer or visit again The staff seemed frustrated with the kitchen and not surprised as the meals were terrible  most of us went home hungry Sack the chef big time seems the kitchen is your downfall Will not go there again 
negative; Been to the Dudley arms for a carvery and it was horrible All the veg dried up and blatantly frozen and tasteless The meat was the same  scraggy end pieces which looked like they had been cooked twice over The worst thing about it was the fact it wasn t even hot Are you allowed to serve food which isn t hot Anyway we didnt eat our meals and didnt get asked when our table was cleared if we enjoyed them otherwise we would have aired our issues Wouldn t go there EVER again I don t know why our friend said it was nice Will have to find another carvery in the area Disgusting Do not go  
negative; Firstly they refused to offer a gluten free option for my son stating he had to order from the adult menu I m not paying for a children s meal of chicken and chips because they had nothing he could eat from the children s menu Eventually after a discussion it was agreed they would do him a gluten free children s portion of chicken and chips Next the starters and mains all arrived together so we sent away the mains until we d finished the starters  Then they produced my son with chicken and chips and said the chicken is gluten free but the chips aren t This is not suitable Why would he want gluten free chicken with chips that have gluten Defeats the whole object The entire meal must be gluten free and without contamination so we sent it back They eventually returned with chicken and baked potato To add my fish and chips wasn t too good either The fish was so dried and hard I couldn t cut it Possibly due to being under the lights waiting while I finished my starter  Finally finished the meal and left Then my son became poorly He had a typical gluten contamination reaction For this reason we will never return and would not recommend anyone with an allergy intolerance to use this restaurant either Very disappointing for a chain of restaurants I would strongly advise training for the kitchen staff to cater for those with allergies intolerances 
negative; Yesterday my partner and I travelled from Leeds over to Long Can Hall after hearing great reviews about the food  We were told by a few couples who had been that they had been walk in diners and explained there would be no need to book as whenever they have been they have just sat straight down Upon entering the bar area we walked over to two waitresses who appeared to be busy talking to one another and didn t greet us so we went over the the bar where a man behind immediately shook his head at us and when we approached the lady behind the bar said Yes may I help you  not a very warm welcome at all I explained we had come to eat and she simply said  We re full I looked around and there was at least tables empty in the bar area this was at approximately pm We then looked through the small window in the snug area and there was also a number of empty tables I understand that these tables may be reserved for diners who may have been arriving shortly but there was no attempt to even accommodate us No apology like you would expect in any restaurant or bar we weren t even offered a drink whilst she could have had a look to see if we could be squeezed in at any point  I then went to use the bathroom after driving for over an hour and after exiting I was approached by a waitress who explained to me the bathroom was only for customers Which I think is disgusting  I am utterly disappointed after being told the food was so great we were looking forward to eating here but after the chilly reception we got and rude attitudes towards us we wouldn t advise anyone to go 
negative; Christmas Day at this oft recommended chain of restaurants was an unmitigated disaster from start to finish Two of the expected party of arrived minutes early to be told that the table had not been dressed Half and hour later we were seated at a table that was missing any type of decoration crackers Totally understaffed for a restaurant full of patrons on the biggest day of the year The service was appalling with dishes arriving either half cooked cold or piping hot depending on which of the different waiters served the table Kicking ourselves that we didn t demand the service charge be chopped off the bill Still the manager maitre d had left by the time we finished so we couldn t lodge a complaint directly Like another poster has already said they suggested we go to the bar while we waited No inkling about the mutterings from the other patrons and the atmosphere was far from Christmassey which is what you expect The staff looked like they wanted to be elsewhere and that added to the general gloom and doom Considering they were charging  per person this was just appalling It will be a cold day in hell before I ever dine there again and will certainly not be recommending them to friends anytime soon either as they clearly cannot cope with anything more strenuous than brunches and drinks 
negative; We ate here with a group of friends and I was really looking forward to the meal as I love Thai green curry Wish we hadn t bothered The food was greasey and had little flavour Really over priced too Will never eat here again 
negative; But we were dissapointed Awful food reheated mush The baked potatoes where dark yellow inside where they had been cooked hours possible days before Truly disgusting 
negative; A poor lunch was had by all The restaurant pub was very very tired and smelt of stale beer The tables weer stivky not cleaned properly The void was burnt and poor service Two of us had a fisfinger sandwich We could not find the fish but lots of burnt batter 
negative; Honestly I hate this place The pizza and service is so bad I ordered a pizza and it was charcoal and when sending it back I met resistance When they re cooked my pizza it was under Disgusting Wouldn t have paid for it if I didn t feel guilty 
negative; Visited here New Years eve  Told would have to wait mins for Chicken Kebabs to be cooked this was fine although restaurant not particularly busy When kebabs arrived they were flat cold and the side of corn actually felt like it had been cooked then refrigerated it was that cold and the fries were Luke warm My sister also ordered chicken breast with cheese and bacon this was also cold Returned the meals and they were brought back to us ten minutes later luke warm after being placed under a grill  although the plates were hot  My sister cut into her chicken and found a spare rib bone three inches long underneath the cheese that was covering her chicken Asked for explanation and was told that all the meat was kept warm together and spare rib bone got mixed up Also asked why my kebab was cold as I had waited mins for it to be cooked  no explanation forthcoming returned our meals and unable to order more by this time as we had booked into the cinema and the film was due to start and the rest of the family had already finished As a result had to resort to popcorn from the cinema for our New Years Eve meal but at least this was warm 
negative; Went out to lunch with a few girl friends  very disappointed the service was very slow at the bar food took too long to arrive friend had to go back to work as her lunch hour had ended  The burger I ordered was so over cooked and dry it could of been made from gandi s flip flop lol not good  pretty poor overall 
negative; Decided to order a take away online via Just Eat with this company  Arrived just outside the one hour slotted slot but we were fine with this Delivery driver got lost but was pleasant and the food arrived hot  Unfortunately though it was the most flavourless and disappointing Indian meal I have ever eaten  The curry was completely without flavour and looked curdled and don t get me started with the meat samosas  They were tiny and truly rancid and did not taste freshly cooked at all No complimentary poppadoms like other companies either Will not be returning just terrible food 
negative; Beautiful surroundings Rubbish menu not much choice Very expensive Roast dinner was diabolical Roast beef was raw Plate flooded in gravy and very unprofessional snooty staff 
negative; Bad service rude v slow starter arrived after an hour stale bread over cooked fish varying sizes of portions and ridiculously expensive only plus was very good somelier 
negative; I have eaten here once before which was an ok experience this time it was shocking the wait is a joke for basic pub food which in my mind is a little overpriced The waiter had little clue of what he was doing no check back and whoever cooks the steaks needs to go on a refresh training course we sent one meal back and by the time we received a replacement everyone else had finished Great views from the window of the pond but that was the only positive oh and wear a coat otherwise you may get hypothermia 
negative; Have been a regular customer for quite some time Took friends for a food and to discuss travel arrangements for a trip Service was great until the point when we were asked if we would like desserts  we asked far another bottle of wine whilst we decided Bottle of wine arrived with a bill We chatted and discussed coffees and desserts at which point a staff member came over and said quot we have another party booked in please pay and leave quot Will NOT be returning 
negative;My Husband and I ate there on his kipper pate was bland and mushy my prawn cocktail was served in a drinks tumbler lacked sauce and seasoning and bizarrely was garnished with a single lettuce leaf positioned to look like a rude gesture I asked for some some bread and was sold a half an uncut loaf the prawns were juicy and plentiful however there was a very bitter aniseed flavour at the bottom  The mains were shocking The whole baked sea bass was way below the cm size requirement for kept fish  legally any fish caught below this size have to be returned alive it was dry and so overcooked it was inedible the accompanying potato salad was so cold it had ice crystals on it and the potatoes were undercooked and hard my slow cooked duck leg was anorexic and tough the spicy sausage pearl barley risotto was tasty  By the time we had finished we were the only two diners left but it was minutes before our plates were cleared as the staff were loudly discussing their social and love lives As she cleared our plates  in one case an almost full plate the waitress enquired if everything was fine We both replied no it was awful she fled before we could elaborate  The bill arrived and we insisted on deducting the service charge as the service was poor they had mixed up the initial drink order and I had to ask times for a refill  In all it was an extremely poor performance from the staff and kitchen my husband reported that the gents toilets were dirty and smelly so I avoided the ladies 
negative; We had a rep come into our workplace to give us a menu on Thursday with the set dishes on each days but then said if the dish for the day was not required we could pick and choose from the menu and he could deliver for  people instead of the required All for this sounded great however when it came to ordering on Friday lunch orders must be ordered by Btw we were told that everyone had to have the Friday menu and could not choose another day So the rep misled and lost our custom How unfortunate 
negative; Went for lunch on Saturday the food was awful poor quality and overpriced It was a bitterly cold day and the fire was allowed to go out which left the place dark and dreary The staff do not seem interested in customers I think they have lost the plot at this place We will not return or recommend it 
negative; After taking the kids to air hop we decided on asda cribbs causeway for late lunch OMG what a filthy and revolting place The service staff were wearing plastic gloves which were filthy dirty and with fingers missing so no point in wearing them and Their aprons obviously hadn t been washed in a very long time When we ordered burrito we were told quot there ain t none quot  When we ordered calzone we were told quot there ain t none quot After looking at the worktops covered in stains and grease we decided it wasn t safe to buy food and so resorted to a prepacked sandwich for the kids We did however buy them a cold drink in a small cup The cashier told us it was a regular When we said it was a small she crossly informed us that they only have serve sizes of drinks Medium and Large NOT small We tried to explain that if there s only sizes then they would be small and large She replied quot are you calling me a liar quot  We hurried off to find a table but sadly out of the  spare tables none were cleared or cleaned from the previous customers We decided to eat in the car but I thought I d make a quick visit to the ladies room  OMG well that s a another essay of horrors which I could write about My advice to you is if you value your health go elsewhere xx 
negative; Visited here with a friend and her children We thought be nice to let children play and then have lunch When we arrived it was all going well children went in to play area to play food was ordered When the food came it was brought out in lots despite being ordered together When the lady brought the second lot of food over she said is that everything i said no still waiting for food Repeated what we was missing she informed me the kitchen staff had forgot and was making it up i explained other food was now cold as waited mins for food to arrive She did not seemed bothered and said i was not the only person to complain today I asked to speak to manager when informed no manager on site so i requested a duty manager she said she would go and find someone I had a young bloke come to us half dressed tie undone not very professional he informed me he had just come on duty i explained the problem and lack of compitence from staff He agreed it was not acceptable chased up the missing food and said he would go reheat our food i said pork cannot be reheated and so he gave option of reordering The food cost pound for adult snacks and childrens meals I was appauled by the response During the play area a child was hit by another child leaving marks on child when parent complained the child was only spoken to but was not removed from play area I will def not eat here again 
negative; I was having a delicious meal with an American friend when I spotted confederate flags on the ceiling I spoke to the waitress telling her that the confederate flag is as racist to Americans as waving the Nazi flag It represents the separation of blacks and whites I said encouraging segregation and the KKK She was extremely apologetic and explained that I should tell the manager as none of the staff were American she was not sure that he knew what the flag meant On telling him he replied quot I know what it means but I don t think people will really worry about it Most people take it light heartedly quot  Unless those flags are taken down I will not be eating there again 
negative;Got risotto what was ment to be with king prawn more like shrimps and only get three of them and tasteless very disappointing Been in lots of different sambucas but forest hall one has to be the worst one as rest have been lovely
negative;Called and made a reservation at : pm for two people Arrived in time and ordered food from the menu We sat and waited for hr and minutes in the table and the food would not arrive Complained to the chef why was getting a couple of starters and a green salad taking almost two hours Chefs answer to us: quot fu ^k off I have other people to serve quot  We walked out of the restaurant We never got to taste the food but the caipirinhas at my local pub are much better 
negative; Haven t been but needed to cancel due to last minute change in schedule  What they don t tell you when they take your booking is that if you cancel they charge you  per person Terrible customer service 
negative; We went for a nice family lunch  Generations one of the few times we could all manage to be together We couldn t have been more disappointed after ordering food we waited over an hour however the dessert turned up before the main course and after sending that back we then had to ask twice more before we had an answer to where our mains were and then had to wait again to for them to be served When it did eventually turn up not one of the meals ordered were edible eggs were dangerously under cooked the gammon and steaks were over cooked the pineapple and fried tomato were so cold they felt like they d just come out of the fridge the chips were greasy and over done the fish batter was thick and soggy When we finished we had to wait another half an hour before having to ask them to clear the table however one attempt at asking was rudely ignored We then faced further waiting for the desert which needless to say was sub standard We requested another cup of tea and were told they didn t have time to make hot drinks The whole experience completely ruined what should have been a lovely afternoon out much to the upset of a year old lady who s idea it was to treat the family and bring us all together It was made worse still when all of us were physically ill after the meal and indeed a week later of us was still recovering Non of us will ever be visiting any other Hungry Horse Establishment again my advice to anyone considering visiting  DON T 
negative; Came here initially for meal and drinks but didn t bother with food the place was a grimy mess This star review starts from this afternoon when I tried to book online the website said full and the only availability was pm  fair enough but I thought I would call the restaurant anyway and try my luck Called them numerous times and finally I got an answer I was told yes pm for  should be okay but if there is a problem I would be called back if I don t hear anything then all is okay What sort of service is that All I wanted was confirmation yes or no not guess work Come pm we arrived and the place was practically empty so why the website said no availability is beyond me There was no one there to greet us so we made our way to the bar to ask where our table was the place is so understaffed too  had to wait several minutes to even be acknowledged Finally we were shown to our table but it was filthy Food stains on the table food under the table dirty cutlery The menus were all grubby and sticky straight away we decided we wouldn t eat as it was unsanitary and just have a drink or two There was a live singer performing and the speaker in the restaurant section was cranked up so high we we literally shouting across the table to hear each other speak It was pm not pm when the bar scene starts kicking off so it wasn t necessary for it to be so loud so early Again we had to wait ages for someone to come over for our order  when they did we said we wanted drinks only no food I ordered a cherry bakewell cocktail they couldn t do it okay I will have a meringue martini they couldn t do it okaaaaay how about a chocolate  vanilla Russian  no we can t do it Seriously is this place a joke Why have these cocktails even on the menu  Begrudgingly we picked a candy cane and a Manhattan finally a selection available The bar staff never asked how my fiancÇ¸ wanted his Manhattan as stated on the menu sweet or dry he actually wanted it sweet but it came dry and he said it was disgusting Because his drink was so vile he wanted a bubblegum daiquiri to take the taste away I ordered a frozen strawberry daiquiri to then be told guess what they don t do it Absolute joke so x bubblegum it was After this nightmare of a visit we decided to go to the bar to pay and leave  As we were leaving a waiter even had the cheek to chase after us outside to ask if we paid our drinks bill on showing the bill to prove we had I pointed out to my partner it should have been roughly  not  as stated as the cocktails are for on a Thursday so he then had to go back inside to get a half refund as they tried to offer charge us The place is a dive and an absolute shambles Concentrate on your staff service cleanliness and stock before you worry about producing fancy overpriced cocktails  Don t bother at all with this place save your cash and go to Cuba round the corner or Lust  Liquor for decent drinks in a cleaner organised venue  
negative; Very bad experience with the two staff in assistance of  people Found them very rude and abrupt  As for the food we had all the courses were over salty This was explained to the lady owner who was also waitressing which she completely ignored dismissed We also explained we felt it was an insult for the second course which came out to us consisting of minced pork flavoured with garlic very salty in a lettuce shaped bowl She then blamed it on our taste 
negative; Visited the O O shortly after it s opening and again fairly recently On both occasions we were extremely disappointed with the service and the food We ordered drinks that never arrived and we had to ask again for The waitress was sent over with the wine that we ordered and I ended up opening it myself as it was too painful to watch her struggling and almost snapping the cork not her fault she should have been properly trained  We then waited  waited for the mediocre over priced food Nobody came to ask if everything was ok during our meal and afterwards we had to ask for coffee we weren t offered a dessert menu but to be honest I didn t fancy trying one anyway Needless to say we definitely will not be returning Also as in previous reviews don t bother writing a lengthy response maybe spend more energy addressing the many problems 
negative; We visited this place at  in the morning and the buffet breakfast was already inedible Horrible sausages that didn t look as if they were made of meat what s the excuse for that in East Anglia unappetising mushrooms hard dry bacon stale toast even the butter was rancid The cappuccino was more like hot milk And there was very loud music playing in the bar  totally inappropriate at this time of day Steer clear 
negative; From start to finish was awful Rude waitress dirty plates dry cold cheap food poor quality poor range choice Drinks were  each and were out of a jug Ended up leaving everything and getting a full refund Avoid the breakfasts You will wait for ages for food to come to pass be dissapointed when the limited range comes out disgusted eating it then leave feeling hungry 
negative; Called in for drinks tonight One bar closed for a private party so went to the main bar Very busy waited minutes to be served but that was fine chatting to my daughter Ended up perched at end of bar friendly staff BUT ladies loos were disgusting at pm Have always been told judge a restaurants kitchen by its loos  I will never eat here 
negative; Had a lovely night out last night celebrating my fiends st birthday went to the tombstone saloon good entertainment good selection of real ales and ciders We then went to the market tavern which was lively as there was a party going on made to feel very welcome Then we went to the trollcart for a very short visit My husband and his friend asked about their ciders and asked if they had any flat ciders non fizzy  The barmaid then suggested one of them was too intoxicated to serve and refused to serve us This was at so four over sixties totally humiliated done the walk of shame and left We then went to the theatre tavern before getting a taxi home and we were greeted with a warm welcome My advice would be not to use the trollcart unless you like public humiliation 
negative; After reading hearing good things our Group of was really looking forward to a culinary delight sadly we were all let down from start to finish  Welsh rarebit thru Duck  Steak  Lamb  Desert TASTELESS 
negative; Under staffed on a busy Sunday evening I had to clean our table Chicken was dried out Lights by path outside don t work 
negative; looked classy but very disappointing Perhaps the chef was on his night off because whoever prepared the crab couldn t All the yucky membrane left in Service wesn t great either considering it was a Monday evening 
negative; I have to confess that I have visited this place before and been very pleased However as we were in a rush today decided their set pizza deal with wine as a set menu would be the best option ughh took  minutes at least for two pizzas to arrive with no other customers present The pizzas were inedible and as we had limited time asked for them to be boxed The bottoms were charcoal and the tops undercooked The staff who were so attentive while there seemed to be disappointed at a lack of a tip one even turned their back on us If I hadn t have been in such a rush I d have asked for a refund However I happily lit my fire tonight with pizza  most expensive fire lighters I ve used to date  BUT don t let this put you off  the guys DO need to check what they are putting out If two pizzas took minutes to get out at least check whether they are fit to serve  
negative; Having eaten here many times my wife and I found that this was like eating at a different restaurant  At least of the dishes had not been replenished so could not choose from them Basicall y the staff had not refilled the serving dishes So with limited choice we thought we go for the crispy chicken pancakes but the chicken ran out  Next I thought I would try the sweet and sour chicken  There was chicken in there but no vegetables Very basic  Finally opted for a plate of beef in blackbean sause but it was awful  Tasted like the meat was off  At no time did staff approach us to see if we were enjoying our meal When I went to pay the bill I was not asked if we had enjoyed the meal so I mentioned all of the problems we had encountered but no apology Instead the member of staff at the till told me that it would be mentioned to the chef  The Chinese Buffet has quite lteally left a bad taste in our mouths so will not be eating there again despite the fact that we both love Chinese food 
negative; I thought I was at a loss of what to say about this establishment we booked a table by telephone and spoke to the owner and chef we asked for a eight o clock booking but was told they had a large party booking at that time so eight thirty was agreed to give them time to sort the large group we arrived at twenty to nine and were promptly seated wine was ordered and we were left for some time before the waitress came to take our order the wine was finished so we order another drink at this time we were told our starters would take another ten to fifteen minutes due to the large party sitting late and being served their main courses at ten minutes to ten we had to ask about our food to be told quot we are giving you your first bottle of wine free of charge to compensate for the delay quot better we were given something to nibble on at that point I had to point out we had sat for an hour with nothing to eat and the length of time wasn t the reply was quot well you can finish you wine and leave when you like your starters are almost ready to be served if you like quot at this point I wasnt impressed other diners were served at the same time as the large party why not us i just thought the whole situation was very un professional we left and found another restaurant nearby the meal was for my partners st birthday treat and being a hotelier in blackpool thought we would try this bistro so we could recommend to our guest I dont know that this will be happening after our experience here  
negative;We were surprised that this restaurant was empty apart from one table But on reflection we left after being offered a dirty and food stained menu Not a good sign for hygiene 
negative; We booked at last minute and they moved things around so they could accommodate us The menu there isn t a lot of choices we had some children with us the children s menu was limited choices My grandson who is is a good eater but the adult menu didn t give him the choice he wanted so he chose a child s chicken which came and there was small stippling of chicken so we ordered extra still no a lot The children got an ice cream with the children s meals no other choice could be bought for them and the adult choice for deserts were limited We ve tried and won t recommend it or be going back again 
negative; dreadful experience went for breakfast tables were dirty not enough staff on as pub was extremely busy when breakfasts came they were cold and greasy I will not be visiting again very disappointed 
negative; Not much to say really Coffee good Burnt currant teacake Slack waitressing toilet horrid Informed staff but no result 
negative; We visited Akamba on Saturday morning at about am The setting is amazing and I was definitely wow d by the setting and decoration inside We were the only people in there at the time of ordering We ordered breakfasts and then added more to the order shortly after when more people were joining us Despite only tables of coming in during the time we were there it took a whole hour for us to get our breakfasts I ve never had to wait so long for a meal I work in marketing for pubs and restaurants so have spent a lot of time eating out The team member who served us Dan was very friendly and apologised for the delay when the food eventually came out But no one came and spoke to us about the wait or gave us any update until we went to ask The food when it came was ok but was nothing special definitely did not warrant an hours wait  Such a shame as there s so much potential here Unfortunately I won t be recommending to friends or family 
negative;I wrote about this place how bad it was Now confirmed as I walked past yesterday and the place has closed down I do wonder about the people that gave this place stars 
negative; I would like to be able to write a good review but we were told that chef had closed the kitchen  The thing was it was  on a Monday night  Their loss two people three courses and a very expensive bottle of red was however Jacksons Bistro s gain as we had a wonderful meal in a delightful atmosphere 
negative;So disappointed we had Xmas lunch for group of approx and the food was simply very poor quality as was the service Most ordered the turkey but not a sign of any cooking just prepacked carrots potatoes and over cooked soggy vegetables even the turkey was bad as tasteless and dried out Another person had the soup  not warm and bland Service was even poor as we had to ask for bottles of wine The whole experience was very poor When we complained about the food the manager was too busy to see to us so the poor waitress had to manage complaints herself Just dont bother go elsewhere terrible value for  
negative; I booked a table for pm with my family we travelled miles round trip to be told by an exasperated member of staff with little apology that we would have a wait and they had run out of roast dinners This was what we went for and he said there was nothing they could do as the kitchen had let them down  I only booked this at noon so should ve let us know they had limited food A wasted journey and extremely disappointed customers 
negative; We were out for a friends birthday celebration and headed for their for Cocktails on the Saturday night We put our orders in and were really looking forward to them After seeing some extremely disappointing cocktails appear I had to chase mine twice after they never arrived After an hour and a half my drink STILL had not arrived and I had to ask for a refund Don t offer a service if you can t deliver on it The drinks were of poor quality and no one was particularly happy with their choice Trying some of the cocktails i m glad mine never arrived especially the awful rhubarb and custard cocktail I presume under staffing was an issue because we even had to clear our own table at times The bar itself could have potential but the service quality and product offering is really something they need to work on This standard of bar really didn t match to any in Bristol Friends and company made the night this bar didn t 
negative;Portions were ridiculously small especially for the price The fried squid was the smallest portion of calamari I have ever been served  Nothing about our meal was Italian  bearing in mind my boyfriend is Italian and he enjoyed it less than I did The Italian nachos were an absolute joke I could ve cooked the pasta myself and the stake was below average We left there still hungry after starters and mains And a  bill for people  There are way better places in Bristol than Jaime s especially for value I m definitely not going there ever again 
negative; My encounter with this establishment happened by chance on a cold and blustery March evening After driving for what seemed like an eternity to find a fish and chip shop that was actually open we stumbled across Mary Jane s  it is at this point that events took a turn for the worse  Upon entering the take away I was rudely told that I had entered through the wrong door and had to go back outside to walk through the door next to the one I had entered some cm distance away Never the less my rumbling tummy had gotten the better of me and against my better judgement placed my order a decision that I would soon regret After waiting for the fine fayre to nuke I mean fry I was then met with the most incompetent member of staff that I have ever come across I truly thought that at some point Jeremy Beadle had he not gone to a better place than this chip shop was going to pop out from behind the counter and shot gotcha  After attempting to wrap my fish supper and failing miserably  almost dropping it on the floor and then catching it on their knee like some sort of circus act I was then overcharged and despite my protestations no rectification of this matter was offered The horror of what was to meet me when I eventually opened the offending parcel could only have been imagined in my wildest dreams I was met with a flat rigid rust coloured greasy chewy dry mess that could no more pass for haddock than I could My mushy peas were extraordinary for the fact that they were a fluorescent green shade and I was able to drink them straight from the carton no cutlery needed It is safe to say that I would never return to this establishment and my advice to other weary travellers who like me find themselves in Cromer on a cold and windy evening do not even entertain the idea of eating here 
negative; most of us like a carvery right but there were very few choices at this place and what was on the hot plates was warm and some mushy like the broccoli and sprouts  very thin pieces of meat and one was so dry not good at all never be going again when complained it was quot oh well quot great p r that 
negative; Can I start with saying our waitress Marta and Barman Mateau made out night and without them we wouldn t have enjoyed a single moment Their service was fab but every other member of staff was rude and far from gracious I run a restaurant and know how valuable your team and service is With a bill of over easily over  per person and % service added they have got your money and don t care what your experience was like  Our starters were below average and extremely disappointing my prawns were beautifully fresh but swimming in water and slightly discoloured iceberg and the whole dish was far from flavourful My main of lobster and chicken oysters were again interesting it was cooked to perfection but accompanied by a jug of hot stock water to pour over it with cress floating in it I did not try before hand and ruined my dish I proceeded to try and eat the stew I had managed to create The quantities were great as we were a group of ladies but the gents on the table next to us were still Ravenous in their words No one said the food was amazing okay and average were two descriptions  The worst part person to have in hospitality works at the Shard to point out she was not even our waitress but barged about with a miserable attitude a small European lady light brown hair and ponytail She slammed our bill on the table and told us to leave we were very happy to leave after our allocated time slot all restaurants have to do this but she had no manners and her service skills reminded me of what I would expect from KFC not the Shard I wanted to share this with who I believe to be the Manager a young man in a blue suit who didn t once check on any tables and stood still for the entire evening with a surly yet bored expression all night When I brought this to the attention of the manager along with items that had been added to our bill he continued to stand there with no sincerity and make excuses All we wanted was an apology Marta noticed we were not happy and came over to rectify the situation with an apology we were very grateful but she was apologising for her colleagues and should not have to do this I very rarely take my time to write reviews however this experience warranted it as my complaints were certainly not taken on board or acknowledged  My boss recently ate at Oblix and recommended the Shard however I will never be recommending to eat if you go for a cocktail find Mateau was fabulous perfect Italian service with a smile 
negative; Visited today after numerous people recommended Think it s living off an old name and the huge desserts Food was awful Cheap nasty frozen style all fried Young Waitresses were far too busy chatting amongst themselves My beef was fatty dry and the edges burnt Kids meals were dire dried up baked beans The children s area was disappointing not a lot for them to play with to be honest First and last visit for us 
negative; If there was a minus rating I would have clicked it The food is APPALLING It takes up to an hour to arrive and that is not just a one off  I have visited numerous times over the years in the hope it will have improved as it so convenient location wise for me Let me give you an example: raw aubergine tomato  raw garlic passed off as a timbale Raw pineapple without the central hard piece removed passed off as a grilled pineapple dessert Piles of onion  dry potato passed off as bubble  squeak When questioned we were told it was deconstructed quot  Hilarious Forgotten bookings defensive staff and HUGE waiting times A joke of a place Oh and not cheap either  
negative;We arrived and ordered a roast lamb shank puff pastry seafood tart and a child s meal The veg on both adult mains was inedible  totally rock hard and foul tasting cauliflower as well as cold We complained and they re served the lamb with chips which my husband asked for To add insult to injury they then only returned us they obviously thought they should charge for the lamb which they carefully worked out the price of The waitress was polite and was the best part of the visit If a chef can t cook a decent roast at pm on a Sunday something is terribly wrong
negative;Lovely little place which used to be the old school But that s were my enjoyment ended Wanted the fish pie that was on menu and was told there was not any despite it only being MD  Then opened for the place on the specials board also told that there was no place So had to have fish and chips which we had to wait half an hour for which I did not mind as freshly cooked but my fish had not been fried long enough so was not crispy and doughy inside Could not be bothered to complain at time as would have to wait for another half hour and was fed up by now that considering they were near all the fisherman catch down BY the harbour they had none of my choices of fish 
negative; I am absolutely disgusted with this place My husband and I booked a table for valentines evening with a couple of friends we each paid a deposit of each I was really looking forward to the meal unfortunatley my mum had terminal cancer and was taken into a hospice that morning as there was nothing my husband could do I told him to go along with our friends on arrival my husband informed the restaurant of the reason that I was not there only to be told very matter of factly that we would lose the deposit anyway my mum died that night Its not the deposit that was lost that has upset me but the way that they were so matter of fact about it we could have cancelled the whole booking and they would have lost a bill I will never ever set foot in this place again and I would never ever reccommend it to anyone I was also told over the phone that there was a set meal in place or the normal menu when in actual fact it was a set menu only avoid this place like the plague 
negative; What my surprise today when the lady from the till Her name was Lorraine was laughing at two elderly women who seemed confused who were asking from fish and chips and soup And not only that she continued ridiculing those two poor women once they were gone laughing and making jokes meanwhile serving people  I found very pathetic to see a women like Lorraine who was at least in her s laughing like a years old just because two elderly women asked for fish and chips 
negative; This place is not at all going The drinks are expensive and food is pathetic the staff is rude We were not allowed entry for min even though we had tickets Please beware of this place if you want to spoil ur night 
negative; we visited the old colonial on sunday we have eaten here before and have never had a bad meal UNTIL Today  I ordered the Sunday chicken roast and my husband ordered the Champion Burger  The food came out and straight away it looked unappealing the chicken roast had clearly been placed in the fryer it was a greyish brown colour and rock hard to get in to it I told the waitress that I was unhappy with the meal she went to check how it was cooked  I was told that the roast chicken is precooked by the suppliers and reheated at the pub  clearly in the fryer I was offered a replacement meal and I chose the new York chicken chicken with bbq sauce bacon and cheese it was served with an over microwaved jacket potato on a sizzling plate of mushy onion and peppers I left most of the meal My husbands burger was average the bread was dry and fell apart  As previously stated we have had good meals at this place but will avoid it from now on Don t advertise your Sunday roast chicken as a Roast then put it in the fryer Yuk A plus side the waitress was polite and friendly 
negative; Well let s start with the only positive I can find  the portions are sizeable The queuing system is ridiculous  we arrived and t other half queued for a bottle of wine Then he queued for some antipasti Then I queued for some pasta The chefs can only prepare two meals at any one time so it s a lengthy process of queuing We fancied a side salad but couldn t face the thought of another queue I watched some people spend mins in the queue to get their food The food itself was average I won t be back 
negative;When my brother booked a table for five weeks in advance the restaurant said they would seat us in the far corner where a table that big would fit However when we arrived two tables seating were not in that position but in another area meaning that we were crammed in and squashed together  When I asked why the original plan hadn t been honoured I was met by an imbecile who talked about blocking fire routes without actually listening to my points Where he had us sitting was blocking the entrance to the area so he was not seeing my point I asked to speak to the manager to which he replied that he was too busy in the kitchen to come and speak to me Finally he asked us to wait in the bar while they rearranged the tables  We arrived to eat at We ordered at  and got our food at too late for LUNCH  Cheap nasty food and worse service 
negative; I was very upset by the way I was spoken to by the land lady She was odviously in a bad mood b serving myself and friends But we weer egnored more than once while she served some regulars When I politely mention I was next she was very rude chuntering under her breath all the time  May I also say the ladies toilets really do need a good clean they were very smelly The carpets were dirty too need replacing big time Not like me to moan as you d sew on my other pages 
negative; I m not sure if the chalets are anything to do with the pub I hope not I checked into the Cherry Tree Chalets and Holiday Lets after being gazumped when buying a caravan I paid  for nights accommodation for myself and my dog  men brought a fridge before I went in I signed the receipt and off they went Within  hour I was asking for my money back but they wouldn t give me a penny Apparently I d signed to accept NO refunds and now I know why I have NEVER seen such a filthy disgusting place in my life Upon telling a chap that had brought the fridge his response was quot Don t moan at me I m only the maintenance man quot and with that he walked off DO NOT go here I left and found somewhere else The pictures speak for themselves This place was recommended by Ma Bakers If the woman there spent more time cleaning than she did sitting on a wall with a cigarette in her mouth this place may have been more presentable As it is it needs levelling 
negative; Horrible place The chef was so rude and abusive The meat was uncooked the chicken  The tables knife and forks glasses etc weren t cleaned properly After complaining the chef wasn t happy and offered a customer a fight outside 
negative; My FiancÇ¸ and I visited this pub this afternoon for lunch on my first impression the pub wasn t too busy but there was dirty sticky tables with dirty pots on a few of the tables I had to ask for our table to be wiped  We ordered the combo starter which wasn t too tasteless but not the best We have eaten you get what you pay for In these pubs that serve microwave prepackaged food  Our mains were terrible my FiancÇ¸ had the jumbo fish and chips and the fish was tasteless watery and jelly like I had the jumbo crispy chicken breast this wasn t a jumbo chicken breast it was a battered to death over squashed escalope so may maybe that s why this gives the reason as to why they can call it jumbo and it was coated in so much bread crumbs fried to kingdom come that you couldn t taste the chicken the rest of the dish was over cooked the jacket potato was firm and could have used it to play cricket with All in all very poor quality utterly disgusting I asked the server to fetch the manager and asked for my money back and without a squabble he obliged which I though was good customer service  We won t be going again Ide rather eat my arm 
negative;Me and my partner live in Brighton and frequently pass this restuarant We have always thought the red and white tables outside look so inviting and planned to visit one evening Well last night we took the plunge and went to Casa De Carlos The restaurant was packed for a Wednesday night A really great mixture of people out dining so initially we had high hopes We were seated at a small table next to the toilet which was a little fustrating as people kept passing but that did not bother us  When ordering our tapas the waiter was pretty pushy He kept saying no you don t want that you want this and thats too much potato In the end we went with what he suggested as we were so confused about what we had and had not ordered I lived in Andalucia the spanish tapas region for a few years and still visit annually so authentic spainish tapas is something I am very used to eating When our meal arrived surprised at how quick it took only around minutes The food itself was shockingly bad The omelette was soggy and tasteless The potatas bravas were like Aunt Betties frozen potatos with a slop of tomato puree on top The battered white bait tasted like over fried lumps of bread crumbs The pork was chewy and so overpowered by garlic and herbs I could not finish it My partner had the lentil and sausage soup and that was OK but he had a hard time finding any sausage We did not stay for dessert and left very quickly after eating Well I have woken up this morning feeling very ill I ve had to call in sick at work as I have been vomitting all morning I m going to spare you the gruesome details and just say I am certain it is the tapas from last night  If you want a real tapas bar then go to Solera D Tapas in the North Laines Me and my partner went there for Valentines Day and were blown away The food was excellent very friendly staff and the atmosphere is like Spain itself One of the best meals I have had in Brighton Plus a lot cheaper Hell even La Tasca is more authentic than this place 
negative; I would not touch the place with a barge pole after the service we received My partner and I were due to get married here and we were very much looking forward to coming But once we e mailed the owner and told her what suppliers were coming and when she replied to us and apparently was very concerned as she had never planned a wedding this way We never asked her to be our wedding planner just to provide the land and the food My partner went to meet with her and she started adding on charge after charge for stupid things She never explained any of these quot fees quot when we paid our despoit and she made it so expenisve she blew our budget completely She then only gave us one day to find a new venue and our wedding is in June this year We were very upset and very angry with the way we were treated You could instantly tell she didn t want our custom But after talking to quite a few people they have also experinced problems with her and her service  Definatly DO NOT GO THERE  Very upset bride to be 
negative;I don t usually leave reviews as I don t like to dwell on bad experiences but this time I really feel I must and warn others to not set foot in that horrible place that is more of a tourist trap than a real restaurant I mean I feel so strongly about it that I shall leave another review in French to warn unsuspecting tourists Whenever in the area my best friend and I usually go to a small Japanese restaurant in Coptic street where the food is good and the Japanese waitresses nice and friendly but that day had been a long day and there was no time to walk any further so we just decided that that Koto place would have to do even though the decor was hotel corporate from the s and the waitress was not Japanese nor was the cook which is usually a bad sign I ordered some scallop nigiri: and I was presented with meagre pieces with a thin slice of scallop not even a full one for pieces of nigiri topped with just wait for it Marie Rose sauce yes the infamous Mary Rose sauce from the s I had to scrape the industrial pink sludge from the nigiri to be able to swallow it Also on the plate was what I took to be the peelings of a carrot did not taste of much apart from vegetable peeling and I put in back on the plate and a cm thick slice of old courgette topped with way too much Wasabi As I love wasabi and am quite partial to courgette I bit into it just to spit it back on the plate And I mean it I actually spat the whole thing back into my hand and back on the plate as the slice of courgette was nasty and at the very least a week old  I tried to go and get my main dish cancelled but was told that it had already been prepared It was some freshwater eel Donbury with a bowl of miso soup on the side The soup was disgusting I added some soya sauce to see if I could make it taste better but one might as well fire in a well and the dish itself well I m at a loss for words really A sweetish omelette was there really any eel in it  on top of lumps of clumpy warmish unsalted rice whose thick texture I could hardly break with my cutlery I did try to eat some of it because I had hardly eaten all day but even as hungry as I was I could not stomach it I mean food that bad is beyond belief And then they have the guts to charge you % for poor service We removed that charge from the bill which was still extortionate  So all in all if I were to summarize my evening in Holborn it was as follows: Pressed for time we decide to go to Koto s the meal was inedible expensive and the staff couldn t have cared less I mean I did try to cancel my main dish after I had tasted the starter Since my friend and I had hardly eaten we ended up in a nearby Tesco to try and find something to calm our hunger pangs and to top it all we ended up arguing because of the bad choice we had made  Please spare yourself the aggro and the knowledge that you will be taken for a right mug 
negative; Staff have err no customer service skill We were there overruled an hour Tables dirty when we arrived same tables not cleared when we left Food and glass every where No wonder the seagulls wait on the roof  This is such a shame as few years ago staff friendly sect  Well over priced One pint ale and a pint Pepsi off the pump Will not be going back 
negative; Similar to an earlier review I also paid for a Living Social deal at this restaurant I too didn t read the small print I was supposed to book by July the actual voucher didnt expire until the th August Living Social did NOT remind me I phoned and had a conversation with the chef and similarly was told that I was too late but if I rang back he would see what he could do I rang back and had another conversation which included the chef saying that there had been several people who had not noticed the small print Anyway he asked me to ring AGAIN this week which I have not done as I am tired of quot flogging a dead horse quot So I have paid my money along with several others and been refused The restaurant should have honoured the payment for the sake of customer service and they also may well have got repeat business As it is they have made a lot of money from those who did not book in time which is all some people care about SHODDY TREATMENT  
negative; We had booked a table for for Saturday th March for an annual celebration which my Dad being a pensioner insists on paying for it takes him months to save up We went to this restaurent last year and there were more of us and it was very nice reason why we went back We had booked for we arrived on time expecting to be shown to a table in the restaurent but they hastily put together small round tables in the corner of the bar  They took our drinks order and eventualy our meal order of us ordered from the specials board At least mins later we were told sorry no specials left so we had to order something else  Our starters came out about mins after we had ordered it very nice but we had to wait at least an hour maybe more for the main meals  of them who had chips were only warm but dare not order fresh ones on case we had to wait another half hour or so  We ordered more drinks but had to remind them to bring these out after about mins of ordering also We did not have desert but just coffees these came out resonably quick We finally left the restaurent at about  so took over hours for us to have our meal  Definatly would not reccomend to anyone else  
negative; Clearly little has been done to this place since its takeover from little chef Ripped upholstery dead flies in the lights and an uninviting layout to the restaurant Staff were unhelpful and food was massively overpriced and pretty tasteless  Don t waste your money here 
negative; Came for a family meal on a Saturday night hardly any other customers in Not very welcoming We perhaps should have known by the quot award winning GARDEN quot sign outside not quot award winning FOOD quot Ordered four different meals ALL of which had serious issues Considering the average cost of the meals was for nothing spectacular expected much much better We POLITELY and REASONABLY pointed out the issues to the landlady who for the record does NOT take CONSTRUCTIVE criticism well She said quot I will go and speak to the kitchen quot  after ten minutes I was still stood at the bar waiting to pay I then explained the full situation to the barmaid who went in search and came back five minutes later relaying a message that the landlady quot would not normally knock anything off the bill but was prepared the take  off the bill quot  As we had waited around so long we decided just to leave and vowed NEVER to return What the landlady did not know is that we are very local to this pub IF it IS true that only locals are welcome then this was not the case They are fortunate we weren t critics or mystery shoppers Taking into account the reduced bill one round of drinks cost + for large glasses of wine one lager shandy and a coke  If you want reasonably priced food and drinks good food and a warm welcome  go a mile or so up the road the quot The Crown quot  Very disappointing If the problems had been accepted and addressed this review would have been stars I hate to write a negative review but really in this case it is deserved NB HAD to give one star to submit a review wanted to give none 
negative; Far too expensive for what you get Manageress was quite rude and her having stern words with staff in front of customers is not professional  Staff weren t very courteous and seemed uninterested Won t be going there again 
negative; Home delivery to minutes away and the burgers were stone cold We had to microwave them Phoned to complain and were offered % off our next order  there will not be a next order Never had a stone cold burger and such poor customer service 
negative; We went to the alleyns head for a sunday lunch and firstly we were told that we could not order at that moment because they were too busy then when we had ordered the food took at least an hour to get to our table when we tried to complain we were told that we were intimidating the staff and were told to leave the pub Sorry to say this is not the only bad trip we have had to the restaurant We would not recommended it at all 
negative; ate here tonight for the first time and last  i now undertand why they offered this deal on groupon this place in trafalgar square is simply bad the meals were so small and the food was very greasy the price was not so small quelle surprise  and i found it very cheeky that at the end they charged service charge for the price i would have paid if i hadn t had the groupon deal its robbery in my opinion then at the end i paid the charge and the waitress gave me less change without apologising making me think it was on purpose she even used the calculator to calculate minus hilarious  please Bianco check your staff they are lots of capable unemployed people out there 
negative; It s not often I would choose to rubbish and entire staff of a restaurant but at years old I think I know bad rude and lazy service when I see and hear it  God only knows what they do behind your back We visited at pm for my son s th birthday  ordered a booth and were placed upstairs even though they were empty  in fact the restaurant was empty When we asked the man showing tables said Oh alright There were of us Gave him a cake for my son and we had courses  by which time it was busy but upstairs remained empty had to ask over and aver again for plates to be cleared and then after waiting for nearly an hour for dessert we gave up and did the whole cake thing at home  I thought we would die there as everything took so long and the staff were so rude  We complained as we paid the bill  with unlit cake and candles still in our hands and the waiter said with a straight face  It s never enough around here  I agreed and asked them to deduct the service charge Hopefully that is enough for him  
negative;Went in last Sunday with my husband and kids I must say it s probably the worst service I ve ever had man behind bar playing with phone when I was stood waiting to order drinks then he walked of so I shouted are you serving and he just kept walking of and shouted quot I m busy quot went back to table and was going to leave but my husband decided to go to the bar and managed to order food wasn t to bad but very poor portions but ok if you are not very hungry The barmaid who come to clean table after us asking times for it to be cleared was very miserable and my year old daughter even said quot she s horrible quot had to laugh and just walk out Try anything once but would never go back again and looking at some of the comments by the owner on here who blames everyone else but herself makes me realise where the staff get there attitude from avoid if you want a pleasant meal
negative; Do not waste your time going to this restaurant for dinner I have tried to eat here and have just walked out after being ignored by the waitress for exactly minutes It was not even that busy I tried another time same thing happened I don t know on what basis they hire their servers but It seems like they care more about them looking quot cool quot then actually doing their job Food is ok but service ruins the experience 
negative;We called in on  with adults and starving children for some lunch We only went there as everywhere else was full  now we know why  There were a few empty tables but we were still told we had to wait we waited mins for them to remember we were waiting and then sat down and ordered  The waiter took the order and we then waited a further minutes for the food to come The music is so loud in there you can t even just sit and chat while you wait for the microwave to ping What then turned up was not what we had ordered The waiter did at least apologise but my niece was so hungry she decided to go ahead and eat the chicken was like rubber and had NOT been cooked fresh despite the minute wait  the cheese on top was able to be picked up in one large rubbery doorstop  We then waited another minutes for the right meals to land Cajun chicken I don t think so  just chicken and onion  cold chips and soggy pizzas for the kids  unbelievably they then charged me for the meals they got wrong too  and this is not a cheap place to eat Never again You wouldn t believe it from this review but we are people who are really easy to please  so this was really bad : 
negative;Grease EVERYWHERE Needed a bleach bath after being in this hole Horrible Workers had dirty fingernails and grubby aprons the walls were practically dripping with grease Couldn t eat the rank looking food that came out because I was so put off by the interior NEVER AGAIN
negative; Three of us visited for a quick drink We found a table upstairs but were asked to sit another table We d just got comfy and asked to move to a table for two We pulled up a third chair but this left us somewhat blocking the access through to the other tables and caused both us and the passing customers staff inconvenience Won t be back 
negative; Popped in here for lunch with my husband and sister  who is in a wheelchair  Even though there were three members of staff i struggled to open the door to get the wheelchair in so my husband took over  The girl who served us was completely on another planet and seemed totally dis interested So we decided not to have lunch just coffee and lunch elsewhere As my husband ordered our tea and coffee he turned to my sister to check her preference and the member of staff all too loudly asked my husband to pay before he sat down  He hadn t finished ordering As my sister was peckish I ordered a Toasted Teacake for her from a small blackboard proudly perched on the counter only to be told in a very curt way that they had sold out The two girls behind the counter were more interested in discussing the bottles of wine from the shelf above them so we had to wait for our drinks which meant they were lukewarm when they arrived My sister was our concern so we didn t complain The bill was incorrect but in our favour which shows the lace of concentration Terrible service and would not go again with or without visitors 
negative; Having flown back in to the North terminal and with a + hour journey still ahead of us my mum  I were looking for somewhere to eat Unfortunately this place was the one we decided on There were two wait staff visible upstairs but one was chatting away having taken payment and the other was well we didn t work it out Upon interrupting the conversation to ask if we waited or could just sit down my mum was told that he would talk to her in a minute After then wandering off into the kitchen area for a bit we were just turning to leave a queue had built up behind us when all of a sudden he appeared again and told us to follow him This introduction should have been a red flag but we were very hungry  had rather heavy suitcases It took minutes for someone to take our order and I had barely got out the Oh we were just wondering before he interrupted to sarcastically reel off exactly how busy he had been Order placed we were told that it would be minutes before our food arrived In the meantime we heard children on the table behind us asking why it took so long to make ice cream they had ordered it not long after we had sat down  The waiting staff made points to avoid eye contact or if caught try to pass the table off on someone else or say they were very busy hence the wait for service I should point out these staff were for the smaller area upstairs at one time there were on the floor only taking any responsibility for taking orders tables were seated after us the entire time we were there and had paid and left before our order was taken There were free tables Once the food arrived minutes later it was quickly placed in front of us before the staff member quickly disappeared no asking if I wanted any sauces for the chips the table was bereft of anything but S P and sugar or if we wanted refills for our now empty drinks My order was missing one ingredient and when I finally got the attention of someone to point it out I was given a very snippy I ll take that pound off your bill then  If it had just been an issue with the food or over abundance of customers that the staff were trying to deal with then we would have left more than the exact bill amount but due to the staff s poor attitude and customer service there was absolutely nothing worth tipping for and we couldn t leave fast enough Sadly our service was not just a one off there were a few tables leaving and cancelling their order and some not even staying that long 
negative;First time I ve been here and the last They tasted stale and the service was appaling Dont waste your money 
negative; Walked found it queued up only to see the cook dip his spoon three times in soup to taste without changing  cleaning spoon Felt totally repulsed extremely poor hygiene Never again Left 
negative;Not been for a while we went today a treat after going to the Theatre The service was poor the selection of fish was poor wine selection very poor no German wine it was very cold had to ask to have a door closed given its december and freezing why have an outside door open Very expensive for what we had just a handfull of chips and peas We wont be going again r
negative; Deteriorating quality Eaten here a number of times including our office Christmas party and it s definitely going downhill They have lost good managerial staff the menu is now limited and extremely poor and the food itself very average for the price We did not book on a Thursday but were offered a table in the bar providing we ordered quickly as the restaurant was fully booked and filling fast We sat down at : and ordered straight away Relaxing over a bottle of wine we were told with no warning that our table was required at : Had we been told this prior to sitting down we would have driven into Alderley Edge for proper service in a decent restaurant The hostess seemed completely out of her depth as if they were overbooked and it certainly seemed like organised chaos She not aware that she had completely ruined our evening Like a previous review if we could have given a zero we would have The bar and bar staff are fine apart from one elderly gentleman being asked if he wanted a glass with his bottle of Becks  but we would not recommend the restaurant to family friends or clients of our business 
negative; After hearing numerous comments on the latest eatery to open in Stevenage I though it high time to get myself down there to review gt gt Well what can one say  Firstly it s not located in the most salubrious part of the Town Centre indeed if there is one when one has passed the not so delightful public houses located in the Town Centre and inhaled a good lungful of noxious fumes not all of which are legal the delightful Salt n Good appears like a Phoenix arising from the ashes that was once Cabarna Actually it was more like a dead and badly stuffed Stevenage Town Centre pigeon of which we have thousands upon thousands  from a taxidermist trainee gt The first thing that struck me was the decor this is what can only be described as quot industrial quot  by this I mean cold concrete floor broken tiles exposed air conditioning and heating pipework The overall look has a quot No expense spared quot air about it only joking more like quot no expenses in the budget quot  To be honest it looks like the fittings from the club have been removed some paint splashed on the walls the floor swept and tables put in place gt We visited on a Saturday night it was fairly busy and very noisy due to having no ceiling  the drinks were rather pricey in comparison to anywhere else in Stevenage I don t mind paying for quality in quality surroundings but this was neither The menu is quot Street Food quot and cooked behind the counter so you can see it being freshly prepared however it was cold and rather sparse you would need to time it right and try to get to the servery just as fresh dishes were topped up it is self service and eat as much as you like however one visit and one portion was more than I could stomach If this place is open and still in business in it s current state in six months time I will be very surprised 
negative; We were recommended to visit the Canteen at Nailsworth as we wanted a simple snack and drinks This was about pm the Canteen closed at pm On approach there was a sign come in to drink and eat There were at least  tables free in what looked like a reclamation yard none of the tables had been cleared but we assumed they were busy and thought we d give it a go on the menu they had salads and sandwiches about mins later two members of staff came out to say that they had sold out of all food except for brownies we assumed they were joking  especially as I had already seen a huge cake selection when we questioned it they confirmed that we could only order brownies I was amazed anyone runs out of all ingredients to their menu and a half hours before closing especially when the shop is opposite a greengrocers We really got the impression that the staff had worked as much as they had wanted to that day The restaurant had made an attempt at being arty to compensate for the poor location but they can not pull it off with filthy tables and poor customer service We found the staff really quite offensive and we certainly wouldn t go back there 
negative;Reasonably priced Could do with having a greater supply of hot food Ran out of Cornish Pasties Sausage Rolls were lovely as was the bread rolls Visit was marred by the attitude of the male waiter Tried to throw me out twice before finishing my meal Kept giving me black looks every time he passed by 
negative; I have just returned from a family lunch at your restaurant and felt i had to provide you with some feedback about our experience We came for lunch to celebrate my sons birthday that is today I made the booking some weeks ago  On arrival at the bar i liked the atmosphere and we were given drinks That part of the meal was ok and i thought we had made a good choice for our celebratory lunch We were then taken through to the restaurant and i was taken aback When we walked in it looked like a childrens kindergarten The tables were strewn with kids toys the floor was covered in food and the restaurant looked like a bombsite Not what i was expecting from your hotel restaurant The waiter walked us through the restaurant to a table stuck in the far corner and explained that he was putting us there due to the mayhem Thoughtful yes but that meant we were stuck away in a dark corner away from everyone with no atmosphere  We waited sometime before a waiter approached us and took out orders including wine order Sometime later our starters arrived still no wine The waiter then asked if we would like wine so we reminded that a bottle had been ordered it finally arrived Starters were very average i could have made better myself in my own kitchen no thought had gone into presentation and it felt like slabs of pate etc had been stuck on a plate We asked for more bread to go with the pate  it never arrived It became clear that you were running your restaurant on limited staff Throughout our meal we had a different waiter deliver each course and at one stage the duty manager started to serve on  i guess to try and rescue a restaurant that was clearly not coping  Main courses came they were cold bland and once again food just stuck on a plate no trimmings or care given to presentation The food was luke warm The bowls of vegetables looked fabulous only to find that the carrots and sprouts were undercooked I like crunchy vegetables but don t expect to have to bite into carrots and sprouts I have to question the standard of the chef that was on duty today if he couldn t even get a few vegetables cooked through Puddings arrived again just basic food slapped on a plate My husband asked for ice cream and simply got scoops of ice cream in a bowl  You may think that this was a fixed price meal so what do I expect Well at  a head + % service a head in a hotel where you pride yourself on reputation i would expect to have a very good quality enjoyable meal It was one of the worst meals I have ever had  Then when the bill came we saw that you had charged us  + % for a glass of wine at the bar we had simply asked for a glass of white wine and you had chosen to serve a large expensive one And you hadn t just charged us for the bottle of wine that didn t arrive you tried to charge us for And the final straw for me was that it was my sons birthday you were well aware that was the case and didn t even acknowledge it with a sparkler  So we have just spent over  on a meal that was perhaps one of the worst dining experiences i can remember and for me you have spoilt what should have been a lovely family day out celebrating  We have dined at Hotel Du Vin in Harrogate many times and my sister held her wedding and reception there too we have never been anything other than impressed on every visit The contrast with our visit to York today couldn t be further apart  I considered complaining at the time and refusing to pay the % service that you had added to our bill when the service had been atrocious l but i did not want to make a scene in front of my son and family on what should be a happy family occasion  I hope you take the feedback on board and others dont have to experience what we have today 
negative;My Auntie was the lady who opened up the White Apron she opened It up about years ago She no longer owns this restraint because she sadly passed away at the age of of cancer in  I helped her set all the restraint up even though I was only young at the time She was my best friend and had so much passion for the restraint I was really disappointed with the service And the food When my auntie owned it it was a living warm welcome and I feel like you are not treated as a guest here at the white apron it s sad because this business was supposed to run in my family but got sold I would like to come back one day but for now it isn t at the top of my list Please have passion in what you do please do it for yourselves and do it for my auntie
negative;This place is actually some kind of joke Thankfully we never had the pleasure of staying at the hotel but instead booked a table for a romantic dinner whilst we were staying in a much better hotel up the road  Rock Lodge When we arrived we were forced to have a drink in the bar area which was like sitting in my Grandad s front room it was also not cheap We were then approached by the main waiter who barked us when he asked why we had not ordered yet He then shoved a menu in our hands at this point we both became a little worried and asked if we could browse the menu at our table which is quite normal I believe We had booked at pm arrived at pm and were not shown to out till would like to point out at this point that I had booked a month in advance To cut a very long story short the food is like something out of a s dinner party menu and not just that the food was in edible When we eventually complained the waiter was in fact so rude accused us being snobs as we were from London then accused us of being rude to the waitresses At this point we just asked for our bill We waited minutes this at which point my b friend went to the desk and asked for the for a discount at which point we became involved in a heated argument with the manager who did not take any of our comments or complaints on board We then refused to pay for the food and turned away when the manager physically insulted my partner by pinning up against the wall We paid for the wine and left  This expereince was so bad that we actaully find it funny but that night it totally ruined a weekend away Stay clear Unless you would like to meet Basil Fawlty 
negative; This place has been made famous by channel television so while i was staying in the Axminster district decided to call in for coffee  light bite I had barely sat down before someone came over  asked what i wanted I asked for a cappuccino with no chocolate on top then started to look at the menu that was on the table There was only drink choices in this menu so i went to the counter to see want was on offer  went back to the table The cappuccino came the waitress put it on the table  i pushed it away saying i ordered one with no chocolate on top I asked about having a pasty or sausage roll  was told SORRY ONLY SERVING CAKE ALL OF THE PASTRY S ARE FOR TAKEAWAY ONLY sO I GOT UP  LEFT went next door to Route lovely food there  
negative; My how this place has gone downhill over the past year  Service was terrible walked in and ordered drinks then were left and ignored for mins and in end got food and grabbed someone else for our drinks The plates were chipped and cold which made the food cold as u were eating and really the variety wasn t veru good amd most of the time u were waiting for something to be replaced because it had run out 
negative; Went for Sunday lunch with a group of friends and what a let down Value for money was definitely off the mark  The portion size which was completely unacceptable comprised of rubber roast potatoes and Yorkshire puddings which were hard  solid inside if I had been given enough I could have built a tower with them  No offer of a reduction on the bill just the Manager asking if we would like to see the sweet menu ƒ?Ýadding insult to injury This was the worst roast dinner i have had the misfortune to experience  Will not be returning or recommending  
negative;A friend and I were up in Manchester for a quick stop over on our journey up North My sister and a couple of our friends live there and they told us we must go there for brunch as its got a great selection of dishes on the menu and they ve always had a pleasant experience It was a lovely day and we thought it would be lovely to sit outside We asked the waitress whether we could and she told us all the seats were taken but she would move us outside once a table became available We sat at a table inside and watched as guests arrived for the next minutes and they were all seated outside Safe to say the offer was not followed up on I found the service to be slow and the waitresses unapologetic and not particularly attentive Our water was served in latte glasses with straws and our napkins were damp Through out the meal there was no sense of urgency at all even though we had a hour drive ahead of us so time was of the essence All the drinks were made in a bar area at the front of the cafÇ¸ which was in full few of the guests I ordered a fresh orange juice FRESH being the key word I watched as the member of staff served my fresh orange juice from a carton of Tropicana I don t know about you but when a menu states a product as being fresh I presume its been made on site and with a shelf life of a few weeks I m not sure how the restaurant can say Tropicana is fresh not to mention the vast amounts of sugar added and the pasteurization process it would ve been through After waiting a good + minutes our food finally arrived I had the avocado toast on sourdough with salsa verde poached eggs and chilli s A couple of things were wrong with this dish The bread that was served with my dish was % not sourdough I expect my eggs to be runny on the inside but these were hands down overdone The salsa verde was the only positive of my dish as it was extremely flavourful My friend had hash with fried eggs She was more disappointed than I was The hash lacked in flavour and her fried was rubbery She asked for a new one but by the time it came her hash was cold We eventually were able to pay and made a hasty exit I don t know whether I have high expectations of brunch due to the rise in popularity in London and the high standards of cuisine and service down south but I was left extremely disappointed and will not be returning to this restaurant again 
negative; We used to use this pub restaurant a lot with two children good food good service Last visits have got worse each time Menu never changes food expensive could live with tis when the service was good too but not now drinks very expensive However biggest difference was the service this time It was shocking  trying to run a large pub on one chef  two front of house bar staff  min wait for mains  burgers  reason we had a table of ten to cook for this place seats + but can not cope with an order for ten meals  min wait for a childs desert Sorry Warwick arms you may have changed hands but I am afraid all I can see coming in the closed signs for you Go to the Pelican in Chew Magna its streets ahead in all aspects 
negative; Andy you really wanna sort yourselves out I came in last night for a quiet glass of wine only to be told you hadn t had a delivery Andy you re a Pub I only wanted a single glass of wine It appears this isn t even a one off The reviewer in December found the same thing Jeez And your response was defensive and rude and unprofessional  I would like to know which brewery you work for so I can make a formal complaint  Id like to think if I ran a pub if have reserves for any eventuality Ç? Please tell me who you work for  Thanks 
negative; Where to start Firstly the toilets were disgraceful They smelt awful too and I visited around am so really they should have been spankingly clean Some of the staff were rude and the food is incredibly overpriced and just ghastly Coffee Tea was  for a paper cup Their idea of a big breakfast which was about  was one greasy egg no choice if you wanted it scambled a dried up piece of bacon a cheap sausage half a tomato cold beans and one slice of toast I am being deadly serious no mushrooms black pudding and tea and coffe was not included and they charged extra for sauce 
negative;All the menus were sticky which we pointed out to the bartender who did nothing about it Waited quite a while for food no one brought us our cutlery so we had to get our own Salad bar was the best bit about our meal Two of our party had ordered fish and chips and both fish were undercooked One of our party had new potatoes which came complete with mud still attached The chickpea and harissa burger was hard in the middle and soggy round the edges and essentially inedible The toilets were absolutely disgraceful strong smell of urine coming from the gents toilet which we could smell from the ladies toilets and near the condiments area Very half hearted service no one bothered to ask if everything was ok Very disappointing as it is such a lovely pub but we won t be going back 
negative; I can t even comment on the food as the service is the rudest most disgusting I have ever come across I imagine the because of where they re located they are so arrogant that they think they can treat people like dirt This was a present but trust me I would never pay a penny to these people 
negative; The prices of drinks are crazy for what it is My lasagne was very watery and my colleague ordered carbonara and it was so salty that he couldn t eat it We ordered the chips on the side and half of them were uncooked and half were burnt The worst experience I ve had ever in the restaurant because even the staff was rude Never coming back again 
negative;took family over from Italy there Took ages to get served my sister s fork was filthy with stuff stuck to it and the food was totally average My bacon was burnt to a frazzle so I had to send the meal back tho this was done with no problem It was totally tasteless How you can kill an English breakfast I don t know but they managed it 
negative; Having eaten at Bella Pais once before we were really looking forward to eating there again and so weeks in advance I booked a table for New Years Eve At no point during the call was I advised the table would be confirmed so when the lady said see you on New Years Eve  I thought that meant my table was booked So you can imagine my upset when we arrived at the restaurant last night to be told we didn t have a reservation because the table hadn t been confirmed I appreciate its a busy night for you and you can t risk no shows But I really feel let down by you for not advising me the table needed to be confirmed prior to our arrival  You spoilt our evening and left us hungry with no other options as everywhere was of course fully booked  Really disappointed Bella Pais 
negative; We travelled to London for the day and night and booked a voucher deal to come and eat here upon arrival we were directed downstairs away from the restaurant and into a dindgy bar pub environment I did not book a restaurant course with wine deal to sit in an underground dive  after explaining to the waiter that we wanted to be upstairs they refused to let us and told us we had to pay full price and told us the voucher stated it was downstairs I then asked them to show me where it said this and they could not as there was nothing there so the waiter let me sit down in the restaurant after realising he was mistaken  Following this another waiter comes over and tells us to move as we were not supposed to be in the restaurant I asked where is said we had to sit downstairs in the dive bar and he said it says its brasserie menu only  which was ironic as I was sitting in the restaurant with the brasserie menu infront of me regardless of them being wrong they still made us pay full price to be there and the voucher was a waste it does not state voucher is for downstairs in disgusting bar pub lout area anywhere  the waiter was rude and embarrassed us infront of the whole restaurant  the food was ok but they wanted us in and out within mins I think they waited minutes between courses  horrible 
negative;Went at lunch time hardly any choice tried the Mexican was all stone cold pointed it out to the waiter he was not bothered the international cuisine was cold pizza chicken nuggets and chips wanted something hot for my son so went to the pasta bar and politely asked for bolognaise so called chef I e expert at heating food on a gloryfied camping stove shoved a plate at me and said choose your pasta and meat and I will cook not friendly not nice avoid
negative; We visited The Swan Inn on for a lunchtime birthday celebration having booked a table well in advance We reported to the barmaid who pointed out our table and said that someone would be along shortly to take our drinks order We sat and waited to be served for almost half an hour We weren t even offered menus let alone drinks and consequently had plenty of time in which to witness the chaos unfolding around us It was apparent that service was painfully slow and the ambiance was like that of a school canteen noisy and overcrowded We eventually became bored with watching the waiting staff chatting among themselves and polishing glasses and decided to cut our losses We ended up next door at The Green Man where we enjoyed a lovely meal and excellent service 
negative; Came in for a drink the other week and went to the bar to ask for a drink as you do  It was very quiet but about four staff were behind the bar and ignored us for about minutes Talked amongst themselfs didn t even say sorry we will be with you in a moment  Finally a boy served us I asked what wines they did and he just pointed out the menu it was like he couldn t be bothered to tell me or talk to us Where was the customer service Asked if they were doing food and it was a no even though the kitchen was clearly open as they were serving people in the restaurant I understand that last orders are last orders but what happened to going above and beyond for customers maybe ask the chef As tables were still being served mains Had our drinks and left without a goodbye Looks like this place just cares about the people they know not getting new customers 
negative;I went with my boyfriend today for a late breakfast We ve been to the East Ham branch and loved every bit Not only has did the food not live up to our previous visit but my partner has been throwing up since we left Absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable We are definitely not returning to this branch 
negative;The food we had was poorly presented and we had ask for cutlery Table not cleared between courses The food was cold my steak was in pieces pate was served with cold toast and steak knife Ordering dessert the waiter came out minutes later and asked if we wanted cream o the profiteroles minutes later came and told us they were of profiteroles and did I still want my dessert I replied no as members of our party was leaving in discussed As result of our visit members of our party suffered upset stomachs I would certainly not recommend this restaurant 
negative; After several conversations assuring that food would be freshly sourced and prepared obvious that some was cheap bought in dishes no stocks of mustard and horseradish to accompany roast beef certain items listed on menu were not available bad service subsequent letter of concern sent but not replied to vote with our feet next time don t go  
negative; I went here with a friend last month on a friday night the food was distinctly average the cost per person was around which probably reflects this and I spent the majority of the night being very ill It ruined by weekend as I was weak and felt ill the whole weekend I think it was either the sushi or the prawns as my friend did not eat either of these and was not ill I have since learned from friends of friends that a number of people have been ill from their visit here and to AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE I considered making a complaint but booking the table for people at pm on the telephone was an arduous enough task so decided not to bother  as I would never go back again anyway 
negative; On holiday in yarnwell we stayed in a lovely cottage my mother in law decided to treat us one evening to a lovely meal We had read a great comments in the visitor s book about the food at the Queen s Head Nassington When we arrived with our grandchildren  of us in all we read the menu which was terrible and the prices were rather very expensive We decided to order the fish and chips on the specials board When it got served  we received fish battered not much bigger than about inches in lengh with chips and a teaspoonful of peas my granddaughter had a bigger portion from the kids menu We all had to have a dessert as we were all starving and we had drink each The meal cost  shocking for what we got and even after our dessert we were still hungary I m afraid the only good thing about this inn was the toilets which were spotless  
negative;I visited this restaurant on a sunday with my daughter a couple of months ago and the food was ok Visited at lunch time today th July with my husband and was very disappointed as I had told him it was good The choice was extremely limited Spare ribs spring rolls seaweed and a couple more starters The main course was a choice of about dishes far less than the menu states The food was just barely warm prawn crackers stale puddings basic I would question it being cooked today The menu is at the weekend and in the week I know this is cheap but it is billed as a buffet Shame it could be so much better 
negative; The cafe looked empty outside and as the surrounding cafes were all heaving we thought we were lucky to be able to grab two tables outside for our party of five We approached the tables and decided to slightly move them together so we could all sit together Now we know exactly why the cafe was empty  As soon as we went to move them a young blonde girl came storming out of the cafe shouting at us quot do NOT move the tables quot  We responded in shock asking why we couldn t put them together as we were in a party of five and would mean us being separated from the young children Without answering she shouted yet again DO NOT MOVE THE TABLES ITS OUR POLICY THEY COLLAPSE As a regular visitor to Keswick I couldn t believe how awful this member of staff shouted at us If she just calmly explained the reason We would have been completely understanding We got up and left immediately and went to the lovely tea room across the road called Brysons Don t waste you re time here as they have no customer service skills at all 
negative; My partner and I regular eat here as service and food is always great Unfortunately on th July at around pm we arrived there and received poor service and food I ordered a chicken skewer when it arrived I started cutting into it and it was pink and undercooked I looked for a few pieces thatw ere cooked ate a few but really couldn t eat it I ate the seasoned fries which were lovely as always What was really disappointing is no one came to ask if the food was ok then when the plates were taken away and I had a full plate of chicken I wasn t asked if there was an issue I could have requested for the food to be cooked properly but by this time I really couldn t have eaten it even if it was cooked again My Mum a few weeks earlie took my eldest son there and received not a crumble but a bowl of liquid and was told thats how it is served I am saddened to say I won t be visiting this Harvester again as seems to have gone downhill in the last months 
negative; Hard to imagine a filthier pub although for some bizarre reason known only to themselves the bar staff decided after cranking up the music and following a loud discussion concerning their exploits from the evening before to clean the brass around the pumps with brasso probably the first time in a decade as we were being served our food nice touch girls the smell drove us to a distant table that clearly didn t extend to their attention took half a packet of baby wipes to clean it honestly The food well kinda lost my enthusiasm by the time it arrived: just couldn t stop thinking about the possible state of the kitchen The place feels run down neglected and badly lets the whole town down This pub belongs in the dark ages what a terrible advert for Cornish hospitality 
negative; I decided to give this place one last try but once again the food quality was poor and the service was bad This is a real shame as the cakes are lovely Would not recommend 
negative;We ordered a takeaway from the restaurant We were advised that the Nan Bread cooker was out of order when we placed our order so ordered sundries to compensate The meal was swimming in fat when we arrived home and the bags coated in oil The vegetarian meal was bland and tasteless with the vegetables being past there best  The chicken dish wasn t any better The chips had been overcooked with hardly any potato remaining The only positive I can draw from the whole experience was the onion bhajis which were quite tasty Overall the meal was poor and probably the worst curry we have tasted It left us feeling quite unwell and I can honestly say that we will never visit again due to this 
negative;Went to Priory Centre today and was disappointed with everything There s no garden centre there A hut with a few plants outside Decided to have something to eat in Beth s Kitchen Asked for two cheese  ham toasted sandwiches which came with salad and chips I asked if coleslaw could be omitted from mine Mine came with coleslaw not too difficult to understand and served with tortilla chips The bread was way to thick and the ham was the cheap processed packaged kind which is tasteless The cheese had no flavour either Staff not overly welcoming or friendly Would never go back to this place again On top of that there was the smell of disinfectant from the toilet and the door to the toilets was kept open lovely not It s such a shame as the setting is quite lovely but this less than average kitchen let s it right down Wish we d tried the pub in the village 
negative; hi normally ok place but sunday was horrid the potatoes tasted like been warmed up in the microwave of us I had to wait hour for my dinner and when it came out the burger was cremated took it back and complained then waited another half an hour for it to be done again not happy we come here quite a lot so not amused by it this time 
negative; Went there for a meal with the family of people They charged us but when we calculated it ourselves and with the staff helping it came to  Don t know what kind of calculator they had to overcharge us nearly  He did offer us the meal for free though because he got caught out But we just paid for what we ate All I can say is this has made me question and calculate every meal out 
negative;Ordered pudding chips and gravy chip muffin and a fish pm Chips were soggy and paper was soaked in grease Fish batter was soggy and inedible and the whole lot went in the bin what a waste of money Either this is the best that Heywood has to offer or the cook tonight was new and needs re training Not the Tommy s I remember and certainly will not be returning 
negative; After a recent family holiday to stay in Sea Palling instead of venturing too far we decided to stroll to The Reef Bar a minute walk away for some food When we arrived we ordered drinks and went to sit down to choose some food The tables were sticky and dated and so we thought we d order then go and sit outside The man that we placed our order with bought our food out  in take away containers and plastic bags  When we said no we were eating here he looked rather put out but said he would go and put the food on plates for us to eat When it came out it looked nothing like the menu said On the menu the sausage and mash was described as quot Four Norfolk Butchers sausages quot and what turned up was three rather sad dried up old sausages you would only imagine came from Iceland or similar and tasted of cardboard whilst the quot Fresh cod and chips quot tasted like another freezer to microwave dinner After paying near on  per meal this was absolutely disgusting The staff were rude the cutlery dirty and all extremely overpriced such a shame for somewhere as beautiful as Sea Palling to be spoilt with the only restaurant there putting off any visiting holidaymakers or visitors from other towns We were there all week but due to this experience on our nd night we never returned 
negative; I cannot comment on the food as after ordering our lunch we waited for over hour and despite reminding staff that we were still there we sat watching later arrivals eating and leaving which is upsetting when you are really hungry so we left We shall not return 
negative; I went for lunch with my husband I asked for soup of the day which was described as tomato soup When it arrived it was actually tomato  basil so not what I was expecting It wasn t the nicest soup I ve ever had and it was accompanied with a bread roll the size of a golf ball  Very stingy and hardly worth it  I chose chicken wrapped in bacon for my main It was tasteless and quite dreadful The bacon was soggy and appeared to have been steamed or boiled with the chicken I couldn t eat it and it put me off ordering the same dish at other restaurants as it was so bad I can only think of this experience when I see it on the menu elsewhere  My husband ordered the lamb  said it was ok  I didn t have dessert but I had a taste of my husbands sticky toffee pudding which had a burnt flavour and was not very nice at all  I had cokes and my husband had a glass of wine The bill was  which I felt was expensive  The service was fine and our waiter was very pleasant We didn t complain we just decided not to return or to recommend 
negative; After having a recommendation on the quality of home cooked food i am sorry to say my family and i had a terrible experience at the Black Swan The service was appalling the waitress was very off with us when we complained about our mix grill being over cooked and the fish being on the small side she offered us complimentary coffee and when she bought them over they was cold and the glass cups was dirty what a shambles i defiantly don t recommend this so called home cooked food establishment Advice try the Wharf at Hockley Heath 
negative; No wonder it is so cheap I wouldn t feed my pet dog that rubbish I would rather pay extra and have good quality food 
negative; First off my wine glass had lipstick on from a previous customer  Our main meal eventually arrived cold then just to top things off our desert was so hard and chewy it was impossible to eat This was my second attempt at this restaurant  Never again  
negative; We were really disappointed with our visit since the dim sum that we ordered was still frozen in the middle We complained but the staff just took it away and brough back another one without apologising The second was not frozen but it did make us worry about the quality of the food from the kitchen Not impressed 
negative; Have been here a few times and never had an issue but this time I was very disappointed The chips were very over cooked and my steak was practically burnt I asked if I could swap the tomato and onion rings for some mushrooms and when I received my meal I was quite shocked to see they had given me one mushroom When I questioned it and asked for more they brought me more out This I found very odd I ended up leaving most of the meal and won t be returning again 
negative; Within minutes of sitting down were asked if we knew what we wanted to eat Food was nice very small portions and I have small appetite men would be left very hungry Expensive limited menu Advised beforehand was my Mothers th birthday that was not noted at all or commented on On receiving bill with % service charge decided what I always do and to pay a tip in cash Was questioned why I wasn t leaving the service charge I said I was but not on my credit card Waiter came over shortly after to asky why I wasn t leaving a service charge I showed him the  cash left by the dish and walked out Not impressed won t visit again Hutong was so much better with service and attentiveness unlike the Aqua Shard Cattle Market  Disappointing spend of  + travel to mark this special occasion 
negative; I have just had a take away tandoori King prawn from here and it us the worst thing I have ever eaten from an Indian take away The prawns were only slightly bigger than supermarket standard prawns They weren t marinaded or grilled at all A quick wash under the tap and they were back to pale pink They didn t even have enough salt and pepper let alone spices They were in a tin foil container swimming in a watery mix of peppers and onions and they tasted of a absolutely nothing at all When I called to complain the person I spoke to maintained that these very small prawns had been skewered and cooked in a tandoor When I told him that they had no holes in them at all and were too small to be skewered he informed me that they have very thin skewers I cannot recommend them 
negative; It s great to see new businesses open in Skipton but this visit to the Cake ole was awful and by the amount of people who walked out when we were there I m not alone in my opinion How do you get served it s a guessing game Can you order two coffees two paninis aand two cakes  No you must order at the counter BTW your coffee and paninis and pay for them then go back and order your cakes and pay for them when you ve eaten your paninis We never got that far The table was uncleared to start with we had to ask the waitress to remove the last persons crockery etc after mins People were complaining loudly about not being served even groups on the same table only got part orders we were in there for over an hour for two toasted sandwiches and two drinks The drinks are served in a hotch potch of quirky crockery which is great but not everyone gets the same sized drink my friend was very upset about her mini cappuccino in a mini cup and saucer We didn t have time to have cakes our three hour parking ticket was nearly up What was the food like dunno we ate it so quickly it didn t hit the sides This was my second visit and my friends first All I can do is aplogise to all our usual shopping haunts in Skipton we didn t get to you today because we were stuck in the Cake Ole It might be teething problems I don t know but I needed a large G T and repeated play of a calming Ray Lemontagne CD when I got home get some training guys 
negative; I had an awful Bacon sandwich there  tomato s were slightly going off and waitress was incredibly distant  didn t really care Would not advise I won t go again 
negative;I % agree with a similarly titled review I really enjoy seafood and was looking forward to some good quality well cooked food The restaurant is unpretentious for sure but the amount quality of food service and ambience of the whole experience was terrible Please don t waste your money on this place 
negative; My friend and I went to The Spring because our usual little independent eatery was closed for refurbishment We explained to the waiter that we needed to be out quite speedily because of having to get back to work and he assured us that as it was early there wouldn t be a problem Before we had even sat down he asked us for drinks orders so we asked him to come back in a minute or two Needless to say they didn t come back and we had to find a member of staff to take our drinks and food order After a further forty minutes without any sign of our order  two soups and two teas hardly complicated  we again had to walk over to find a member of staff to chase up We got our food minutes after walking in We asked for a reduction on the bill because of the dreadful service again didn t happen Reminded waitress of the slow service she called what must have been the manager who decided to cancel the bill completely  She also appeared to be extremely displeased with her staff  This isn t the first time we have suffered slow service in this place which given the above average prices for what is essentially a pub is unacceptable 
negative; We ordered cream teas a toasted BBQ chicken panini and some nachos with salsa and melted cheese Our order was placed at : and the counter service was satisfactory however being given our pot of tea which was for of us and was more suitably sized to serve  and a satisfactory coffee we were mistaken in thinking that our scones would follow shortly They did not After minutes we politely asked at the counter how long our meal would be to which we were told minutes We decided that this was too long as our parking ticket was running out and so we requested a refund for the food that we had payed for but not received We were then told that they could make it in minutes After minutes the panini came  minutes later we were shouted to from the ice cream hatch to collect our cream teas when all tables around us were being waited on and had their food brought to them The quality of the cream tea was poor dry scones were a huge disappointment and they were not particularly generous with the amount of jam and cream The fact that we had finished our tea and coffee minutes prior to the arrival of the food was outrageous The nachos came with melted cheese and a pot of tomato based salsa on the side however both the cheese and salsa were cold  Our overall experience was one of great disappointment and we would not recommend this establishment to any other customers  Red Rock More like Red Cock 
negative; We stopped here for lunch whilst on holiday My husband had the ham ploughmans which was okay I ordered the steak bagette I specifically asked if it came with onions and was told it can do  I didnt want onions and this was written down on the order sheet for the kitchen When my meal arrived it had caramelised onions inside the bagette I told the waitress Id ordered it without onions and she promptly took it away to have it corrected Corrected happened to be just scraping the onions off the bread and returning the food to me I could have done that The onions had soaked into the bread and made it all black red onions  I was expecting a fresh bagette but no When we went to pay my husband had to tell them what we had had and how much each item was 
negative; Not much choice of food The chicken in the curry tasted nothing like chicken no extra utensils so had to use same fork all the way throughout our meal saw the staff scraping food that had been dropped back into the food to be served not one chinese person working there and none of the staff spoke english AVOID AT ALL COSTS 
negative; I came here when it first opened and loved it despite not being a chinese fan when I visited tonight I could not get out fast enough it was disgusting The worst food I have ever had and that s saying something the tepanyaki was raw and not what I ordered the floor was do slippy it was dangerous and the hygiene level was non existant when we tried to complain they were not interested in listening and just wanted to call the police instead this place needs shutting down before domeone dies so annoyed I can t give it a zero rating This is yhe the lowest it would let me put but belive me it should be minus  
negative; We thought we would order fish and chips here for good Friday as we had friends over We rang the order through and gave them minutes to get the order ready we came for the order and it was not finished and it only had two people in the restaurant when we got home we had hardly any chips we paid for sausages and chips and the cod and chips cost we asked for them to write down how much it cost as people were paying separately they said a sausage only cost  so they charged us for a handful of chips The fish was not cod and it was the most disgusting fish and chips I have ever tasted and nobody enjoyed the food you could not call what they gave us chips as they were not cooked fully on the menu for the restaurant it said cod fillet and that was what I thought we were getting what crap thank you at the bridge for the shittest meal I have ever tasted someone needs to investigate them as all these holiday makers will get ripped off they are now looking into people selling fish as cod and naming it cod when in fact it is not cod I hope they get investigated for ripping people off and selling uneatable food 
negative; I booked a table for supper and was told that although I couldn t reserve one outside they would make it a priority for me Arrived and spoke to a waitress who could barely be bothered to turn around saying there were no outdoor tables available When I pointed to one she sighed and reluctantly said I could have it Another waitress cleared the table and when I asked if she could wipe it clean told me off for sitting down soon After receiving a chipped glass annoyance at asking for parmesan and pepper and I was ready to call the manager Luckily the food was stunning A real shame and one of the very few times I was tempted not to pay the service charge  I wonder what Americans whose service industry is so amazing would have made of it 
negative; This restaurant lacks everything  Terrible service  cats around whilst you are eating  No atmosphere at all  Owner miserable just mooching around not even trying to make conversation 
negative; Ok this is a local restaurant and to be honest I do not believe there is one good curry to be had in Streetly really are we to be palmed off with second rate Asian food here However I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed at the food at this restaurant along with the attitude of the staff when we made a complaint about the food I know we suffer from a lack of good restaurants here in Streetly but if this is your choice and you have the least inkling about Asian food be prepared to be disappointed  the emperor is NOT wearing new clothes 
negative; I dined in this restaurant on a quiet Saturday night around pm and the service and food could not have been any worse My partner and I were greeted by the manager who did not smile or say anything to us but just sat us down at a table near the kitchen We waited a while to order drinks and when the food order was taken the waitress had to repeatedly as both me and my partner what we wanted as she couldn t speak English After telling her what I wanted for the fourth time she told me that my choice was unavailable something which customers should be told straight away when seated at a table to avoid disappointment As my partner and I waited for our food we saw that there were about people in the kitchen most of which we just standing around and not doing anything this in my opinion looked really bad Our food eventually arrived but did not look at all appetising I had order the chicken and roast pepper risotto which looked very bland and boring and my partner order the duck my risotto was hard and the roast peppers were not even cooked My partners duck tasted disgusting and the vegetables were all boiled in a bag We also ordered a garlic bread on the side but what we received was bread with garlic butter on top It was obvious that this food was not fresh by the look and the taste Throughout the meal we did not receive a check back to which I was very annoyed as I had barely touched my risotto The manager came over to clear our plates but she did not ask how the meal was so I told her that I was not happy with my food At this point she did not offer an apology all she said was you did not like it  and she walked away  minutes later the same lady came back over with dessert menus to which my partner and I declined as we just wanted to leave We asked for the bill and it was brought over with my meal not on it I was very disappointed with how this was dealt with as I was not even offered an apology or another dish as I was still starving I think Prezzo really need to look into their staffing structure and the people they hire as managers as I will never return to another Prezzo Awful food and awful service by the manager 
negative; Bought a Groupon  tried to book but it was weeks before we could get a table Read the reviews on the day and started to worry Got a phone call hours before we were due to say their oven had broken and they had to cancel From other reviews they have certainly had more than their fair share of disasters Didn t believe a word so contacted Groupon and got a full refund Went elsewhere and had a great meal and would not be tempted to ever go back given the runaround we got 
negative; We ordered on line delivery was minutes later than they said no real problem there but the food was cold and tasteless my guess is the meat was really cheap we had kebabs chicken sandwiches chips all had to be reheated The chicken wasn t cooked properly I believe this shop has changed hands it never used to be bad I wont be ordering again 
negative; I visited on a Sunday with my daughter As there was noting on the menu that I fancied I opted for the Sunday lunch It was cold tastless and in my opinion not fit to eat I tried to complain to the waitress but she just wasn t intrested My daughter had a burger which also was inedible I will never ever set foot inside this place again 
negative; I grew up in Christleton and wanted to take my in laws out for a lovely pre Christmas meal my partner daughter and i  have eaten here many times and have always loved it  and as my in laws were travelling down for the day  we decided this would be the best place to take them for dinner  how wrong we were  The starters were pathetic small lumps of goats cheese each accompanied by one olive and a sliver of beetroot The drinks order was incorrect the main courses were sloppy and not as described and my mother in law had to send her meal back as it was cold The waitress advised her that she would ask Chef to warm it up in the microwave The homemade chips were soggy and fell apart and despite having to complain several times  we were faced with a rather defensive member of staff  informing us that they didn t usually have complaints  and she would  let chef know  but he won t be happy  We were given money off the final bill  but this hardly made up for the fact that this was supposed to be a treat for my husbands parents and  was  quite frankly  a dismal and disappointing experience i am sad to say that we will not be returning Ever 
negative; Went in expecting a nice American themed meal and came out thinking Budget budget budget  Don t waste your money Place was fine food needs seriously improving 
negative; Unfortunately I think a new chef is required along with trained waiters  I had turbot which was so dry it was turned up at the edges and about quot x quot with no sauce just chips and coleslaw One of the party had pork which was also as dry as a bone  The only diners amongst us who had a decent meal were those who ordered steak or gammon  these were the safest choices The meal took about minutes to arrive they forgot our drinks order and the waiters insisted on calling the ladies amongst us sweetie or darling  
negative; My daughter and I visited today However as much as I applaud a vegan restaurant we were unaware from the outside that this was indeed vegan We were told to order by the till and the menu was set to open so did not see the vegan eatery logo She ordered a VLT which stated bacon etc and a vanilla milkshake and I a latte which was very nice by the way  We waited a long time for her shake and the staff were not very friendly Her vanilla shake was full on banana flavour and I was told that all the shakes have banana in them I understand that but she did order vanilla so I expect it to taste same  This was changed to a shake that tasted even worse which she and I could not drink and she had had nothing to eat as the VLT was obviously not was expected I agreed to meet in the middle and asked if she could have a piece of cake instead but was told no  I would have to complain to the manager I didn t bother I just left lighter in the pocket for a latte and a hungry child s belly Won t be going back 
negative;So we like going to the dukes head alot we visited last week on the off chance that there would be a table free there was but was informed that people that come in after us that had booked will be served first so this week we decided to call in to see if a table was available at pm the BARMAID because that s all she is  asked my friend if we could come a bit earlier and could we make sure we were out by pm firstly I have never been for a meal where I ve been told what time I must leave once my friend had told me what had been said i felt a bit put out and like we wouldn t be welcome so I said phone and cancel  the BARMAID WAS EXTREMELY RUDE ON THE PHONE and wouldn t let my friend get a word in edgeways  then the manager phoned us back and wasn t much better its funny how they re all smiles and nothings too much trouble while they re taking your money But the second you say something that they don t like they turn rude and nasty Too the point where I am still in shock at THE LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE WHEN DEALING WITH A COMPLAINT I for one shall be spreading the word the food maybe nice but not worth the bile that comes out of the barmaids mouth and you d think the manager would know better and have more tact 
negative; I have been to the Harvester several times but will never be back After minutes of giving the waitress our order nothing was forthcoming and we left Alice our waitress last night having taken our meal order and another order for further drinks disappeared and we never saw her again What an absolute shambles  my opinion is don t touch it with a bargpole  
negative; I have been eating at Thai Bangla for the past months since I moved to the area The food was always superb However I ordered a take away for collection when I arrived home I realised none of the food was what we ordered I phoned to ask for the correct meals to be delivered to which they agreed a lead time of minutes An hour later the driver arrived with half of the food we ordered I ordered the food at pm and by :pm after paying  for the food I still hadn t eaten  After a series of phone calls I had to drive back over to receive a refund Customer service was appalling im left feeling seriously disappointed and if these changes are down to a change in the business structure then management should take note Bad end to  
negative; The owner of this cafe has just seen fit to tell several dozen people sheltering in his cafe for dear life in a terrifying storm to GET OUT  Several hysterical and very frightened children were among the people sheltering having run from extreme storm force winds and a sandstorm on the beach with objects flying through the air yet this choice piece of work behaved like we were a group of overstaying partygoers  We were all disgusted by this man s shameful and very dangerous attitude aggressively forcing people back out into the storm because it was private property and closing time  A horrible experience Sad that the other members of staff were genuinely kind to us and helped us shelter And yes we have eaten here before It is very overpriced With dreadful service from this deeply unpleasant individual 
negative; Visited for afternoon tea with my Mum The location is beautiful  The food looked and tasted wonderful BUT the waitress behind the bar scratched her head and played with her long hair the whole time of our visit Her hair was tied in a pony tail but reached right down her back swaying backwards and forwards as she bent down to serve us It would have looked much smarter and been more hygienic if it was totally tied up in a bun Staff may possibly need more Food and Hygiene training as you do NOT scratch your head or play with your hair when working with food or behind a bar Not the best impression for an establishment trying to attract high end clientele 
negative; We were a group of for my husbands birthday  the service was so dreadful that I would never go back Drinks took minutes and even the mezze pre ordered took  hours to arrive Some guests had to leave for the last train before the main courses arrived and when they did arrive they were wrong despite being pre ordered and people weren t fed at all The place was not organised and in fact a complete shambles I wrote to all of our guests the following day to apologize There were just of us left by the time the waitress came over and said shall I serve the desserts I have never been more furious What a terrible experience 
negative; popped into Costa near Debenhams on Stockton High Street with guests i had a hot chocolate  they had coffees one was a sticky toffee latte the other salted caramel cappuccino first they took ages to stop faffing between themelves and serve then they had no clean cups so did we mind take out which we agreed then the proceeded to stat putting the ingredients into them  the girl returned with clean glasses so he poured out the mixture into glasses then not know which was which stuck his nose into the glasses to sniff to distinguish then eventually we got our order i requested not scalding hot choc it was then they whilst pouring the cappuccino spilt it so mopped it off the saucer then refilled spilling again then left us take them on over hearing our dissatisfaction brought a fresh second cup which was fowl  undrinkable it tasted just of burnt coffee at this point took it back  left disgusted 
negative; Last night I went to this restaurant to celebrate my daughter s birthday along with my son As you can see from the title we had just finished our main course ok food when a mouse rang between the tables in front of us I immediately called over the waiter who told me they had problems with mice coming in the back door this is located past the kitchens a long way from the dining area  The Manager I think then came over and was very laid back about this saying they were going to call pest control Shortly after the first sighting there it was again hiding under a table then running to the window I could not believe the staff s attitiude say there were more in there and what about when they close at night what happens then  We asked to sit outside as I couldn t bear to think of this running around my feet The waiter told me please not to make a noise when I walked out if I saw the mouse again  Once outside they offered us deserts on the house but all I wanted was to leave I couldn t believe that the bill came up and we were charged as normal and could see a waiter inside with a long handled dustpan and brush trying to catch it under the tables no apologies at all I have never in all my life seen a mouse in a restaurant and I was particularly worried about the staff s laidback attitude to this I know it s London but surely pest control should be in place 
negative; No words to describe how poor the service and underwhelming the food was I know good service in London is not easy to find but this is a whole new level  Rude noisy average food and way overpriced Well done ruining a great spot 
negative;I visited Jamie s a few months ago and had a bad experience The service was terrible  having to wait for drinks and remind them when they didn t arrive cutlery missing The tables were packed together like sardines and there was no space to move  we were practically on top of our fellow diners It was like a glorified cafÇ¸ The waitress went on endlessly about the specials going into far too much detail which wasn t needed The whole experience didn t live up to what I thought would be a good one being Jamie s 
negative; It s not often I feel like I did eating at Michael Woods Our food from Burger king was fine but the restaurant seating was filthy  Floor covered in bits of food and rubbish table dirty seating grim surfaces around us marked with drips of grot  This wasn t busy day type dirty it was well established lack of interest dirty  Seriously in need of a proper deep clean and a shake up  
negative; Worst mixed grill ever Luke warm asked for mustard must have gone to France for it as never came Meal missing tomato peas onion rings 
negative;Some family and I visited the Print Room on Saturday the th November for a th birthday dinner Toilets were covered in sick by pm our table was booked for : but we didn t receive our starters til : service was terrible food was cold and undercooked and the manager James was rude to the birthday girl when she questioned the level of service  For seven of us the meal came to It was expensive for what it was I had duck breast which was cold served on a pile of very undercooked if at all cooked  beans apparently straight out of a Green Giant tin The birthday girl had a butternut squash risotto and her mother had a pea risotto Other than the colour there was no difference between the two dishes and we struggled to tell the difference between the two when tasting them They were both cold watery and grainy  with undercooked vegetables peas or squash in both No one checked our meal to see if there was a problem at any stage through dinner  When the birthday girl questioned the level of service received vs what we were expected to pay she was told abruptly by James the manager that there was nothing he could do about it as the transaction had already gone through the card machine was only just being set up at this stage no transaction had gone through  At one point James walked up to our table saw that there were plates and glasses needed clearing and promptly walked off again and shut himself in his office When I questioned his attitude towards the birthday girl he was extremely rude to me and told me that quot he would never say there was nothing he could do to one of his customers quot I heard him say it  and that if we wanted to complain we would have to come back another day  Unfortunately for James and his crew at the Print Room my work Christmas Party was booked there for December There would have been nearly of us And we re cancelling the whole lot 
negative; Today was our second visit to Rutland Cottage our first visit was in April and the food and service was excellent Our return visit today was disappointing from start to finish We was not greeted upon arrival we found our selves a table and ordered nachos for a starter plus our main meals After waiting minutes our nachos eventually arrived followed shortly after by our mains One of the mains was bought out incorrectly the waitress didn t apologise and came across quite rude She took the burger back to the kitchen and not long later she returned with the same burger to say the kitchen staff have sent her back out to say we had to keep this burger we hadn t ordered or wait for what we had actually ordered but they re busy so it will be a long wait Everyone else on the table had almost finished their meals by the time the right burger was bought out It was suppose to have chilli and sour cream on however there was no sour cream on the burger We went up to the bar to ask for a pot of sour cream to pour over the burger the barmaid shouted through to the back to request some for the chef to shout back quot is it that burger that s come back once and gone back out again tell her the sour cream is under the chilli  quot There was no sour cream on the burger whatsoever Every staff member we dealt with tonight we re very rude I can appreciate they were busy but we came as a group of people all paying customers with good expectations of the place The food was nice however the bad customer service defiantly outweighs the good from the bad and I for one will not be returning 
negative; I have been to Rutland Cottage previously and has a really good experience  great food nice staff However visited again last night and couldn t of had a more different experience Ordered nachos to start and waited over mins for them to arrive In the meantime we ordered our burgers and these came around  mins after the nachos One of our party was brought the wrong burger no apology was offered at all the waitress just picked up the burger and walked off When she returned a few minutes later she told us that the kitchen had said we either needed to just have that burger or wait for the ordered burger to be made but that we would be waiting a long time as they were busy  still no apology the waitress just seemed annoyed The rest of the table had almost finished their meals by the time the burger came out It was missing sour cream that the menu had said it came with but when we asked at the bar for a small pot of sour cream to put on the chef just shouted from the kitchen quot is it that burger that s come back once and gone back out again tell her the sour cream is under the chilli quot which was quite rude The food was ok when it finally arrived but all members of staff were so rude and unhelpful it completely ruined everyone s evening I don t think anyone will be going back 
negative; I arrived at Bodeans on Saturday night after travelling a fair distance When i arrived i asked for a table for i was advised that i would need to wait for about minutes in the upstairs bar area Only to discover that half an hour later the menu was different to the main menu which was downstairs which we wanted after checking out the menu online when I asked for table downstairs instead i was informed that there was hours waiting time It was very disorganised chaotic and the seating arrangements was rather bizarre people was being piled next to each other because of lack space and seating We was so hungry after waiting that when food was brought out to people everyone would stare at them I would never go back there we left after discovering that we had to wait hours for the full menu shambles 
negative; Awful food awful service place is filthy which made me itch i swear there is bugs in here Staff are rude stand chatting and giving customers dirty looks Stay away at all costs 
negative; Had table service Waitress took my card for payment Came back a few minutes later with my card and the machine My card had been blocked She took my card away got another card machine Same problem Alarm bells were ringing I gave her another card which again she went to take away DESPITE THE FACT SHE HAD THE CARD READER IN HER HAND I said no she should leave my card here When I phoned Barclays they advised that my pin number had been entered wrong three times at a place called Libery Lon at pm on Friday night  the same time I was at Jewel Nice fraud attempts going on there 
negative; Me and my partner were very fond of what used to be Shalimar Indian and recently Thai Thai has taken over it We were returning customers for the Shalimar for year and adored this restaurant We visited Thai Thai and were greeted by a number of staff No one appeared to know what they were doing No staff could explain any of the menu choices or appeared to know anything about them We were satisfied with the starter and continued with the meal There was no little extras like background music that the old Indian would offer and it was quite uncomfortable to sit throughout the whole meal as you could hear everyone else s conversation The portions were very small but weren t revolting but defiantly didn t taste like authentic Thai food After the meal we paid the bill and handed over to a member of of staff We headed out to the car park and were followed by a member of staff running towards us as we were getting into the car This member of staff told us that we hadn t paid for our meal I was highly embarrassed and to be honest angry that we had been approached in this way so headed back into the restaurant to ask for an explanation Not one member of staff apologised or even offered to resolve the embarrassment they had caused  I will not be returning to this restaurant and am very let down how unorganised this place is They have no idea what they are doing WHAT A SHAME  If you want authentic Thai food visit Tom Yam in Poynton they put this place to shame 
negative; Do not eat at this place food is horrible I had the gammon and it was the worse thing I ve ever tasted I told them I wasn t happy and they told me loads of people order gammon which I thought was very rude other people I was with ordered the burger which they left as it says home burger but the quality was poor the food is also over priced for the quality  
negative; Nothing special overrated corporate no soul My family and I used to go here all the time but sincethey renovated they % ruined it 
negative; Booked our family Boxing Day Christmas Meal in October for  I went in to check everything was okay and to hand in our preordered meals two weeks ago At this time I was assured all was well When we arrived at the booked time on Boxing Day and was told no booking was made for us I handed over my reservation form to which I was told they had no room for us We were eventually offered three separate tables which I refused as I wanted us all to be seated together My family and I then had to rearrange the tables ourselves Took over an hour for starters to arrive no crackers on our table We were made to pay for the children who were fed up with the wait to play in the play area No crackers no party poppers and no sign of Christmas or an apology from staff A total let down eventually we were given a our food free but I will never be returning as it was a complete shambles Was told by other tables they had the same or similar issues too I believe the rating I ve given was to high for the service that was provided Stay clear 
negative;Website and menu looked great just what we need as we were staying opposite what a big mistake Struggling to find anything good about it staff were more interested in having a gossip than serving the customers We ordered burgers both that were completely charcoaled but raw in the middle and not served how the menu stated The salmon was as dry as can be with grey unappetising vegetables even the new potatoes were grey and looked as though they had been there since last season Definitely a big mistake visiting this restaurant would never normally consider eating at KFC but after seeing this down the road am sure we would have got a better meal there 
negative; Hideous revolting little place loud noisy and nothing edible or appealing to eat at all Save yourself the bother and pay to use the lounge 
negative; we thought we d give the pub a chance at lunch and we were lured by the burger options  mins later pub was empty we queried where the food was the waitress stomped off to speak to the chef who was sitting having a drink on the other side of the pub  the food had been sitting in the lift rather than apologise and offer to cook up afresh plate the chef delivered to us our cold food with a hint of a smirk on his face not quite sure what they thought we were going to do but we got a refund and visited M S food hall instead we will not be returning to sozzled sausage again suggest they work on customer service and give the place a good clean as well 
negative; The Christmas menu looked lovely and the staff at a local charity spent time choosing their selection but despite having booked the Christmas menu three weeks in advance taken in menu requests a week in advance the restaurant denied having received them We were offered the Christmas menu with over half the options crossed out and who knew how long to wait We ended up with fish and chips which was excellent no Christmas pudding but a cold mince pie with our tea 
negative; I visited here with my young family and I totally agree with other reviews that this place has gone spectacularly downhill since it opened when it was excellent On this visit my last it was not that busy but EVERY table was covered in dirty dishes and glasses We decided to sit by the window and had to clear the half eaten breakfast plates ourselves The table was so revolting I had to clean it myself with a baby wipe as there were no waitress staff We ordered and there was no refillable coffee in either station while we waited minutes for our food which finally came out cold No tables were cleared the entire time we were there over an hour  yep that half eaten breakfast was still there on the table we had moved it to when we arrived disgusting and unhygienic I don t believe in leaving bad reviews without giving right of reply so I contacted the Stannary Court who told me to go and eat there again um why would I take my family to such an awful place again When I suggested this was ridiculous I was offered a % discount voucher which couldn t be used on half the menu or any of the drinks For the money it would cost me to repeat this visit to this unworthy establishment I could go to one of the much better hostelries in Plympton which is the good fortune I wish for you I ve enjoyed the Wetherspoons brand for years and one of the things about it is that is offers excellent value sadly it is now just cheap and nasty Avoid I will be 
negative; The meal was very good but the waiter was extremely rude and lacked basic social skills: after we had been sat for a while ordered and had our drinks on the table he requested that one of us get up and replaced his chair with a foot stool so that he would accommodate another customer who just arrived at the time He managed to ruin the good mood at the table Truly disappointmenting 
negative; My friends and I are regular s in Blue Cafe but after the service we received last Friday night we would never go again We ordered our usual bottle of Merlot and were asked if we wanted to try it before we bought it We said that this wasn t needed as it was our usual bottle of wine in the shop When the waitress opened the bottle the screw cap popped like a bottle of champagne that had lots of gas in it Then we she poured the wine into my glass it fizzed like a glass of champagne Me and other friends took a mouthful and all agreed that the wine tasted out of date We told the owner that the wine didn t taste right and she said there was nothing wrong with it I asked how could she tell there was nothing wrong with it without tasting it so she took barely a mouthful without saying there was nothing wrong with it I explained that we were paying customers and that we all agreed it didn t taste right We had not drunk half a bottle and then complained it was our first mouthful She told us that she didn t care that as the owner she was right we were wrong and it was not out of date and that we were to pay for the out of date wine We told her we weren t going to pay for something that was unsatisfactory and she told us to get out Apart from being locals and I accept that this could ve been a one off out of date bottle of wine we will never go to Blue Cafe in Leatherhead again due to the aggressive rude service we received from the owner A disgusting wine served by a disgusting establishment I don t reccommend anyone to go to this cafe and my only regret is that i didn t take the wine and get it tested I work in Hospitality and feel so passionate about this and the service we received that I have also taken this to Trading Standards Big big mistake 
negative; Having been to Darcys in Shifnal many times before and throughyl enjoying it I decided for my Birthday I d take my family to try boy how I was wrong Having rang and tried to book it was noted that they still didnt tske bookings so we crossed our fingers and went to try When we walked in we was greeted by a lady who was very pleasant and asked to take a seat we had my five year old very well behaved daughter with us Then a guy marched over and sated very bruntly that they didnt do tables of especially seeing that it was a child he then went on to explain in a far from professional manner that they didnt have a licence for children under and how he found it very starnge but the reason being that he couldnt supply changing facilties and continued to talk and make up reasons  The thing was he was talkig to three Licencees who believe it or not know the rules and regulations about this trade I can understand they dont want children ruining there ambience but why not say One thing I always prided Darcys on was their ability to make people feel welcome their warm nature and great food however I will never return  Ps the bigger venue has definitely spoilt the character you once had at Shifnal  So all in all I would not recommend this to families 
negative; Called into the Elveden Inn to check it out on Sunday for having family to stay over soon and found half of what was on the main and specials menu was not available Waiters did not know what was and what was not available When our choice did arrive only half of what we should have received was on the plate What we did have was very nice However after deciding on the drastically reduced dessert menu  I chose a hot chocolate only to be advised that they did not have any milk Didnt get to complain as no one around and was exasperated when even the bill was incorrect  Great setting just a shame about the experience especially when they cater for accommodation leaves you wondering what you will get for the next days breakfast 
negative;After this restaurant was recommended by a colleague I was keen to take my partner there for a quiet meal This place is not what you would expect from a French restaurant From the moment we walked through the door there was a sense of contempt from the scruffy French Manager who s people skills has left a sour taste in my mouth We were left for what seemed like an age before he asked us about beverages and it look even longer before a menu one menu between both of us was presented to us When asked about what specials they had we were directed to a blackboard that was poorly presented and illegible we couldn t see most of it as there was a large group of people in front of it After being shown to our seats we were anxious about what was about to be served up to our complete surprise the food was second to none There are so many restaurants in Leeds who really strive to retain their customers unfortunately even though our meal was excellent we will not return to this dark basement restaurant as the staff are clearly on the wrong career path Very poor Sous le Nez it s just not worth it 
negative; We used to come here every time we were in the area I am not sure if it s been taken over but it USED to be lovely fish and chips I ordered a large plaice and was told they were all the same size so I said ok and ordered chips with it  quot did you want small medium or large chips quot I was asked small I said then I ordered my cod and chips After a wait which I don t mind as you know it will be nice and fresh and hot it was ready took it acroos the road to the car Well the portion size of fish was tiny and the chips seemed like they had been there for hours The prices for what you got were really high Compared to Mrs T s in Southwold Quay this place is awful We will never come back here 
negative; Echoing others comments this is a beautiful character pub with lovely views that should be a goldmine Unfortunately completely ruined by the RUDEST STAFF and POOR MANAGEMENT  I can understand that the Hotel may wish to keep some reserved space for it s residents especially if they are paying such extortionate prices This is no excuse however for the shoddy appalling treatment of their other customers Although the public bar is tiny there is plenty of space down below to create toilets and a pleasant eating area My friend and I were actually looking to spend a fair amount of money on a good Fishy lunch but it proved hard enough to get a drink from the surly arrogant boy behind the bar I gave Burgh Island the curtesy of emailing them first regarding my complaint in early September but have not received a reply  Perhaps they should bear in mind that some of us peasants could actually have been potential customers for their hotel if we had been suitable impressed Also pile of old mattresses and rubbish on the island not a good look 
negative; four of us ate here on a sunday a few weeks ago Not many people in which should have alerted us as other establishments packed Okay where to start tables rather grubby sat down and ordered food and drinks plenty of bar staff pity all stood behind bar chatting The food was disgusting never in my life have i had a pig in blanket that was hot but still pale white i believe could have been microwaved and not grilled therefore RAW total slop Fish finger sand which what could be wrong with that well dry bread two soggy fishfingers and burnt cold chips wished gone home and had beans on toast I have expressed my concerns to square and fayre but SUPRISE not very satisfactory response Oh and just to add to the glamour waitress delivered food with long sleeve cardy covering her hand so no tea towel then just use your cardy 
negative; i visited the parkbrook pub with family recently for a meal and drinks It was the worst pub i have ever visited The owners john and margy walk past you and ignore you when you are trying to order drinks making you stand at the bar until someone else decides to come behind the bar and serve you The food was disgusting it was like a really bad ready meal that was out of date And in response to the above comment John and margy DO think it is acceptable to scream at young children and scare the living daylights out of them It was the worse customer service i have ever had And we had to sit there and listen to the arguements and the disgusting language between the owners I would seroiusly avoid this pub at all costs Absolutely disgusting 
negative; Awful place rude staff and cold food Will not be returing The staff didnt look like they had a clue what they were doing it was an awful experience and i will not be coming here again 
negative;I only usually leave good positive feedback but on this occasion I have to agree with the negative comments My husband and I were looking forward to a superb meal two Saturdays ago We ordered a bottle south Africa red wine at the bar only to receive a bottle of Australian red we were not given an alternative choice but told they didn t have the bottle chosen but this wine was its equivalent Alarm bells started ringing then Restaurant was not busy starters were medioca No bread or water offered Main courses arrived I ordered steak my husband ordered Duck Usually we would rather pay and say nothing not wanting to make a fuss if we didn t enjoy a meal However I was shocked when my husband said he wouldn t pay for his meal as it was awful It was  The duck seemed as if it had been boiled no colour and tasteless The hand cut chips were obviously oven chips When I asked the waitress if this was a Michelin star restaurant she said she didn t know and would ask Upon her return she said the chef had been on masterchef and yes it is a Michelin star establishment We complained she offered our wine free but we had already paid for that We paid for one main course and were offered two puddings on the house we declined paid what we owed and left and we will not be returning Food not up to par for the price they are charging I would rather spend my money in my local village pub on delicious home cooked food at half the price 
negative; Went up to my local pub today for what I hoped would be a relaxing lunch Within minutes of sitting down I was faced with one of the owners with industrial sized buckets of chemicals starting to clean the carpet right in front of my table and taking a knife from my table top to scrape something off the carpet  I moved to get away from the fumes only to find myself in the line of a catering delivery and people in none too clean clothing carrying packages through the bar area and restaurant Interesting to note at least that not much is homemade judging by these  Surely these tasks could be carried out other than while people are eating and trying to relax Very disappointed didn t finish the meal which was not cheap 
negative; well we decided to pop into this diner which looked good loved the music they were playing oldies but goodies as they we just wanted to have a drink and dry of as it was tipping with rain at that moment we were in there so me  my husband both had a hot chocolate while my cousin  husband both wanted decaf coffee so we put our order in with my cousin specifying she just wamted a one shot of coffee as she don t like strong coffee the waitress took note of this so there we we re waiting waiting waiting then they brought the two hot chocs so then we was waiting waiting waiting for the coffee s my cousin enguired where their coffee s we re we we re told the manager had to do them but was busy doing something else so eventually she made the coffee s but as i was watching her give the drinks to another waitress i also saw the waitress wipe the side of the glass with her finger and then wiped it on the side of the tray she was carrying them on my cousin asked was hers a one shot to which they said no it was two just like the other one  well that was it my cousin went bollistic at them saying they had been waiting for minutes by now just for two coffee s and then still got the order wrong so she then refused to pay for the drinks and that included the hot chocs me  my husband had already drunk so up we got and walked out with out paying how hard can it be to get a simple order like a cup of coffee right  we did feel sorry for our waitress though as it wasn t her fault she did her part right needless to say we wont be going there again 
negative; My partner and I decided to visit the Cunningman in Burghfield today mondaythjuly for a quick lunchtime drink and a bite to eat We ordered our food and lunch of scampi medley and toffee Sundae and informed the bar staff of our table outside The main meal arrived quite promptly but although the food looked okay the peas were cold the tartare sauce had no taste and the breaded scampi on a couple of pieces had the smallest piece of scampi you could imagine  Throughout our meal we were never approached to ask if the meal was okay and if we required anything Once we finished we waited for our plates to be removed and our dessert to arrive but after waiting min my partner decided to enquire the whereabouts of our dessert and the bar staff went and reminded the kitchen My partner came back out into the garden and we decided to just wander through the garden to look at the canal only to be disgusted with dog mess in the garden that we nearly trod in as we were not expected to find this in a pub garden We then returned to our seats and waited for our pudding My partner again went in to enquire about our dessert only to be told it would be another minutes He then informed them that he did not want the pudding as we had waited minutes already and another minutes was not satisfactory and wanted a refund as we had a meeting to get to Whilst he was was waiting for the refund He then came back out to the garden to inform me and the both of us went back into the bar area where a female employee of yours went to us is this yours  My partner asked her if she meant  was it our refund for the dessert in which she replied  yes My partner then asked her about is this normal service of their restaurant and could he speak to the manager The female employee replied she was duty manager and went on to make excuses about that normally someone would come out to the table and clear plates and the dessert would normally be out quicker but that Monday lunchtime they were really busy and not a lot of staff on It was until my partner enquired how he could complain that she took it upon herself to say sorry  I was disgusted with the way she was spoke to my partner as if we were in the wrong to complain The restaurant did not seem that busy and there seemed enough staff on to clear a few plates and get a dessert out on time I have to say that after this experience I do not have any desire to revisit this restaurant and will not be recommending it to anyone I know 
negative; Very disappointed waited over half a hour for food my husbands burgers were burnt and dry my slow cooked chicken was also dry and gravy cold will not be returning and will definitely not recommend 
negative; We were really disappointed of the quality of this restaurant not only for the food but especially for the service First of all the waiter that attented us didn t speak much English and had difficulty to understand us and the orders he had to take The extra drinks that we ordered and solicited more than one time never arrived Also the food that ARRIVED AFTER MINUTES was poorly presented and didn t taste nice at all When we complained to the manager about the dissatisfactory experience we had explaining that we dind t want to pay the Service Charge he wasn t comprehensive at all and not only he didn t apologise but also ASKED US TO LEAVE THE RESTAURANT WITH THE PROMISE OF NOT COMING BACK AGAIN We ensured him that with the bad service and the disgraceful management it was really hard for us to even think to come back I hope that my honest opinion will prevent people from entering this restaurant The next door Wahaca is undoubtedly better 
negative; We visited just after pm on Saturday There was one other couple in the restaurant at the time we ordered The starters were  Calamari over cooked and obviously frozen Crab gratin no sign of crab just slop with a crust Mushrooms passable Seafood Chowder looked very impressive but tasted of nothing at all even when laced with lemon and salt and pepper there was plenty of it but fish was tasteless The main courses  whole seabass well presented but very over cooked Duck was ok but the veg was burnt  The pasta dishes were completley tasteless and pasta was well over cooked  how can anyone not cook pasta We did not eat it Very disappointed especially as the place was not busy The bill was nearly  i told the staff at the time but no one seemed concerned i asked for the pasta dishes to be removed from the bill which they were this should have been offered 
negative; Food was very poor and service was not much better as we had to wait over an hour for main course and we had a wide range of food as there were of us and none of the food was of good quality  either over cooked greasy or just poor quality food  I would not eat here again 
negative; My boyfriend decided to treat me to lunch on our way to Exeter being local we have eaten here before but I must warn you the service we received last week was disgusting  On arrival we were seated by a lovely waitress after a few minutes we could hear someone screaming in the kitchen and throwing a tantrum We assumed it was a child maybe a family member of the owner No it was one of the waitress s throwing a strop for all to hear She bought our food out and stomped off without asking if we would like any condiments We then discovered we had ordered a burger which came with several toppings one being a quot waffle quot the waffle was nowhere to be seen so we asked the waitress to come over as we wanted some ketchup we also asked where the missing topping was seeing as it was not cheap and we would be paying for it  she explained that the menu was changing therefore they did not want to order anymore waffles so that was the explanation Is that our problem I then asked why she did not just tell us this when taking the order or perhaps offer us something else as a substitute she proceeded to storm off into the kitchen screaming so we could hear how p ssed off she is with people asking her where the waffle is The table next to us looked at us in total shock Non of us could believe how awful and big mouthed this waitress was The other two lovely waitress s could see we were horrified and had to apologise on her behalf We were put off our food and felt very uncomfortable I have no idea how anyone could employ someone so very unprofessional It s not our fault you are having a bad day love if you don t want to be polite I suggest you go and work somewhere else throwing a tantrum and acting like a complete spoilt brat is not attractive The poor other waitress s had to pick up your mess You should be ashamed GROW UP 
negative; Angry isnt the word  Booked a table last week for tonight at Taxi into Leeds to find the place shut  no sign of life  no notes on the door or billboard  not answering the phone 
negative; Rang on Sunday morn to ask what time carvery finished and was told pm so booked table for carvery meal for family at  pm on being seated and asking what roasts were available we were then advised that no carvery was available as they had ran out I ordered medium rare sirloin steak which arrived overdone  a burger for hubby which was black with dry bun steak pie daughter started to eat with long hair in the pie  chicken burger for other daughter also dry all the meals served with what looked like carrots peas left over from lunchtime carvery Awful and such a shame as a lovely pub and good service but will not be back in hurry  hubby did speak to manager and she did take on board comments Really hope they do 
negative; We visited Da Romi for a birthday meal as an alternative to the usual Wetherspoon carvery and booked for pm I wasn t told when I booked that Da Romi also does a carvery on Sunday and doesn t do it s normal Italian menu Not a good start There is no disabled access and the actual carvery or more precisely the meat is up steep steps so was inaccessible to one of our party  as were the loos  The menu included Italian starters I chose mushrooms which were marked as v and whilst I accept as the waiter kindly pointed out I should have read that they also included pancetta I didn t so was served a veggie starter with non veggie ham  I then asked for the salmon which was on the Sunday menu only to be told there was no salmon I asked if they could do me a salad  which they couldn t  The others in my party got a large plateful of meat and one Aunt Bessie s yorkie pud We then had to wait for dishes of over cooked veg to arrive at the table  including tinned peas swimming in water and lukewarm mashed spud  and the roast potatoes turned up half way through the meal We didn t dare stay for pudding for fear of further disappointment One of the waitresses did her best to defuse my annoyance and our bill was halved As an alternative I was offered a free meal on another day to try the Italian menu but I can t imagine ever wanting to go back Apparently this is the first week they have done the carvery but why would you choose to go to an Italian restaurant for a carvery costing  when you could go to a pub and get a much better Sunday lunch for a lot less Wish we d stuck to our original plan and gone to one of the Italian chains Bella Italia or Zizzis Da Romi was shocking and we won t be going back A birthday meal to be remembered or forgotten as quickly as possible  
negative; Basically every retailer in Fulham is food or drinks based and with that being the case I have no idea how this place survives The service is so crappy  min wait for water bad food and being told we couldn t even pay for our food at the table Pretty bad place Fulham is such a brunchy al fresco place so it s easy to find somewhere else and that s what I d recommend 
negative;Really rude manager and made his employee who served us feel very uncomfortable Not a place to go to ever again and I live locally Shame on him for refusing our Tastecard and our custom We would have been back if he had been more accommodating Their house wine is watered down and he refused to take my Tastecard just because I forgot to tell him at the start Poor poor service So unfriendly and the place lacks atmosphere Much better restaurants nearby avoid this one 
negative; Booked table on recommendation Arrived pm Staff were lovely and very attentive That s the only good thing to say ordered a steak medium to well it was burnt to a crisp and no bigger than a child s palm mash potatoes were sloppy and tasteless other order was fish chips and mushy peas all food was mushy sloppy fish and chips like rubber won t be eating there again 
negative; The food was awful the service was terrible and the bill was incorrect at the end Would advise all customers to thoroughly check their bill after they have eaten The staff were extremely rude and we were cramped on to a table that was repeatedly knocked by the waiting staff Would never return  
negative; Now as a young thing I used to get to go here with my parents for a treat so when we were off to the theatre it made sense to give it a try How I wish we hadn t  There were of us for dinner we d pre booked as a theatre visit and had informed staff that a member of our party was disabled so we didn t get off to a great start when we had to get upstairs a to get a table and b to get to the loo no one had told us they were upstairs Anyway when it came to ordering I asked for the carbonara with no black pepper as I d had a recent allergic reaction The waitress went to check and when she returned I was informed that it s already in their sauces their burgers and their pizzas So that limited the menu a fair bit for me to salads a jacket potato etc so in the end I opted for Scampi My daughter opted for a salad and that was ok Hubby went for a burger which was overcooked with bacon that was brittle and it was served in a breadcake that you d get from the supermarket quot basics quot brand It did come with chips although these seemed to be the frozen tasteless variety My mother in law s vegetable lasagne was pretty pitiful and she s way easier than me to please and the dish included a number of the woody stems of cauliflower On the plus side it was hot  My scampi came and it appeared a generous portion That was as good as it got The pieces were frozen and were obviously the super budget brand Many pieces had no fish content whatsoever some had a small prawn like substance but many of these hadn t been deveined Now I know you can eat it but I d rather not I also got the frozen tastless chips For this we were charged over Our whole bill came to  and to be honest it would be worth Max Including the drinks  I used to think of this place with nostalgia with its quaint old fashioned style but after this visit I see it as a tired dated poor quality restaurant that s way past its sell by date I can only think that it keeps going on the back of theatre trade but for those looking for a pre theatre meal use your legs and go further afield Your tastebuds will thank you for it 
negative; If I had been advised that the chef has gone home ill and they had to get some food to reheat from Iceland I would have believed them My calzone pizza was little more than a folded in half biscuit with some sloppy sauce inside and then burnt under a grill Alarms bells also rang when my friend asked if she could have the carbonara with a pasta instead of spaghetti and was told that it already has the sauce on Any self respecting Italian restaurant should be able to put any sauce with any pasta Home cooked I don t think so 
negative;Me and my husband decided to try here for lunch as been recommended by friends It was very quiet there was no staff to seat us so we decided to sit in the window as it was a nice day The waiter finally came to to take our order we had the tapas wasn t great and basically got frown on to the table we only had drink as the waiter never even came back we finished Then had to go find the waiter so we could pay and leave wont go back again  Very disappointed
negative;As a local family we chose to dine out at Delhi Spice where fantastic restaurants like the White Horse and Oak on the Green were also available We had heard mixed reviews but understood the food was good We ordered promptly Just mains no starters Almost hours later our food arrives cold Needless to say we were not impressed when we sent the food back the waiters seemed upset with us for kicking up a fuss but again we had to then wait for our meals The manager was very polite with our complaint however we will not be coming back Looks like we ll be going to the pubs restaurants on the Green next time 
negative; we were the only people in the restaurant so can t understand why it took so long to serve us However the insult of the evening was when we asked if small plates on the menu referred to tapas style dishes with a smirk the waitress answered  no no that s starters She then proceeded to the kitchen and recounted to the kitchen staff about the idiots who didn t know what small plates were  I still don t know why I didn t just leave at that point Service was poor menu limited and food  so so We won t be going back 
negative; I tend to have low expectations when I go out for Italian food as being Italian myself makes me rather bias However the fact this restaurant tries to pass itself off as Italian is just shocking I ordered the garlic pizza bread which was a thick doughy mess with tasteless cheese on it and it didn t even taste of garlic I then had the Tagliatelle Arrabiata which I asked for extra chilies with and thank God I did since it masked the taste or lack of it It basically tasted as if someone had poured a tin of tomatoes over the pasta without adding salt or anything Oh and the pasta was also all gloopy because some chef does not know how long to cook it for  it says it on the packet so even an idiot can do that bit right The only reason I ate here was because I was staying in the hotel I should have gone across the road to Frankie and Benny s for a meal that at least could have some flavour If you are going to call yourself an Italian restaurant at least get the basics right You can t charge money for food that is worse than what I have been served at a friends house who can barely boil an egg 
negative; I came to this place to eat and expected good food what I got was far from it my starter soup was cold and the main course was obviously not cooked correctly as I was chucking my guts up for days after sort it out please p s the managers were extremely rude told me to leave and never come back just because I complained 
negative; After asking for a sandwich on the menu we were told not available until but cafe opens at  Two Americanos ordered and we asked why hot water was separate the retort was do you want see the manager in a very threatening way its not the first time we have visited this cafe and not the first time staff have been extremely rude The girl on the coffee machine looks so grumpy we are frightened to ask for another coffee  Please send your staff on some customer service course  you want a friendly face with your morning coffee not moody people who act like they are doing you a favour serving you Shame because the concept is good  
negative; Having enjoyed this meal on a previous visit my son and I were eager to choose again It proved to have been a mistake Unless you like oil sodden tepid soft dark brown chips cold dry mushy peas and soggy battered fish with oil dripping from the deep cracks in the board it was served on causing it to run off onto the table and onto your clothes avoid this meal I asked for a doggy box to bring the fish home for my cat I wrote a letter of complaint to the Manager but over two weeks later no reply wasted We won t be going again nor will my friends and neighbours who I d encouraged to visit The atmosphere and staff were excellent but the food on this oaccasion was simply dreadful 
negative; We had been to Shogun a few times before but not before it moved to The Cube Got a sudden urge to eat sushi today I thought Shogun would at least be better than Woktastic up by the library  How wrong I was This place had just gone from BAD to TERRIBLE Today is a Saturday so I would expect a lot more people eating in there than what we saw today We opted for the buffet as we wanted a quick lunch before taking a stroll by the canals My year old daughter wasn t keen on the sushi even the ones with cooked crab stick in the mayo was spicy so she couldn t eat that so we went ahead and ordered a Yasai Yaki Soba stir fried vegetable noodles to a waitress who barely spoke any English So we wait and wait my daughter kept asking me: quot Mummy noodles coming soon  yeah quot I told her the chefs in the kitchen are cooking now and will be ready soon After about minutes another waitress brought out a bowl of noodles in soup and handed to us we told them this was not what we ordered and had to even point to the menu to show the non English speaking waitress who took our order We got no apologies and they took the bowl back into the kitchen and I assumed they were going to cook us what we initially ordered  After another minutes of waiting and a very hungry child later a plate of noodles were presented to us Yes this time they got it right and was a stir fry noodle dish but we could not see any colour on the noodles and it tasted very quot soggy quot and extremely salty  We suspect the noodles were just drained and put in a wok to stir fry with the chef putting other seasoning in it I had fed my daughter some and she would not eat it Would NOT In the end I told her off and poor thing tried to eat some more and hid in a corner and puked up what little noodles I gave her because it was THAT bad  Needless to say we left the whole plate almost intact we moved the garnish By the way there were no apologies nor was there a check back to see if the noodles were okay To add insult to the injury the chefs started putting stir friend noodles on the belt We are not usually ones to kick up a fuss so we finished up and paid I went to the counter to pay and we got charged for everything plus a % service charge I was very disappointed with the whole experience and can t believe they even put a service charge on  I did tell the waitress who took my money that the Yasai Yaki Soba was sooooooo soooo salty and she didn t even apologize All she said was : quot OK I will tell the chef quot I doubt this place will get any better and we will definitely NEVER return We left there and bought a sandwich to feed my daughter which she was MUCH more satisfied with If a child won t eat their food I think that says it all really To sum it all up the food was rubbish the staff aren t even Japanese the staff uniforms are just tacky kimonos to make it seem authentic service charge is forced upon you and staff aren t nearly apologetic enough when something goes wrong  THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO THERE  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  
negative;We chose this pub for a family lunch prior to a funeral in Chichester We have never had such terrible food in any pub anywhere before We had to wait for a long time for the food when it came it was almost inedible We should have made a fuss and refused to pay we certainly won t go back there again  what a shame as we are all local to the area 
negative; st time we visited this restaurant thought we d have a nice spot of breakfast to set us up for a busy day ahead saw it advertised for pounds as we having a kitchen refitted  very busy when we arrived at am ordered to cappuccinos we got after waiting nearly half an hour  ok the lass was onn her own trying to serve people at once but really is not acceptable as myself working in a fast paced catering trade myself would not leave people waiting this long or maybe an apology would hav done but zero food arrived mins late stone cold little bite we refused to start eating it extra coffees didnt come  was in there hour and we left hungry as hungry as we came in didnt pay upt n left  disgraceful 
negative; Visited for champagne afternoon tea without the tea This was a groupon deal so did not expect much But I must say I did expect at the very least to receive a cup of tea I did not even mind the fact that we shared one scone between two and half an eclair each not having a cup of tea took the biscuit However as it was afternoon tea we purchased the tea separately The thing is I have been on several champagne afternoon tea experiences and this is the first and last time I will entertain champagne afternoon tea without the tea In addition I will never visit indulgence again we saw the waitress when they served and hospitality was surely lacking My advice is save your pennies  A very dissatisfied customer 
negative; food came out fish finger sandwich with no salad gammon egg and chips the chips was stone cold These pubs think they are so good they just serve you rubbish won t be returning better places out there 
negative; dÇ¸cor tasteful and clean food tasty plentiful and hot customer service awful The staff in this restaurant let the place down so much they are miserable and inattentive If you want a pleasant dining experience then I would advise you to go elsewhere 
negative; I rated star as that is minimum I could give This place has gone downhill  would struggle to give half star rating Visited bank holiday Monday  as soon as we arrived was told certain foods were unavailabe as they had run out Waited ages for food  when it finally arrived It looked like a child s portion All soap dispensers in ladies toilets were empty Being bank holiday unprepared for volume of customers Bad management  Ps Still waiting for dessert as I m writing this 
negative; Too busy to take order for collection from a frequent customer of over years and rude manager and owner Such a shame as good food but we will go elsewhere as we are spoilt for choice for good curry houses in the area 
negative; Extremely watery curry it was like soup Had to eat this out of a bowl and gave up halfway Me and my husband had two different curries and they were both like this Would not order from here again 
negative; So disappointed with how unhelpful the manager was on the night who tried to argue with me when they totally messed up my booking for people which they made A LOT of money from they only gave a us enough seating space for  when I asked him to add an extra table he refused and was very abrupt and rude to me so we were very squashed for the amount we spent that night I was disgusted and would never take my work colleagues or friends there ever again if you are looking for good service do not bother and go somewhere better in Brighton  
negative;Lots of dogs in the bar area  Yes it s a country pub but they just seemed to be allowed to run riot not on leads either Been in a couple of times different days times always the same The first time one dog urinated under the table where two diners were siitting it wasn t cleaned up Second time a few families in the bar again dogs running and one crapped the smell was horrendous This time it was cleared up but seriously you expect to go for a drink without being harrassedby dogs that deficate everywhere nothing was said Totally unacceptable Remind me not to eat in there 
negative; My family and I have visited this location many times when it was part of Fayre and Square We decided to visit it on the th Dec for lunch to see how it had changed We had to wait minutes to place our food order at the bar Gone was the table service that existed before Then we waited minutes for our food There were adults and children in our party and we were absolutely starving by the time to cold food arrived There were no serving staff around to ask where our order was so we had to wander around the pub twice to ask The first person I asked after a min wait didn t even bother to come back When the food arrived my order didn t include all it was meant to Again I had to walk downstairs to find someone to talk to and when I did explain she disappeared for minutes and bought me the food that was missing which I initially told her not to bother with  No manager was present to talk to and there was no customer service in terms of anyone asking us at our table if everything was ok I don t know whether they have made a lot of staff redundant and got new people in but it was an absolute shambles We weren t the only people waiting for our food Another table next to us was waiting for an hour I wouldn t bother to visit this pub until they have sorted their organisation out It was two hours of my life I wont get back and with a yr and yr old child getting fidgety and moaning because they were hungry it wasn t a pleasant experience 
negative;I visited last night with family for a birthday meal We had booked a table for of us but on arrival we were sat on different tables It took roughly for our orders to be taken which is understandable when it s busy  The first table had their orders taken first and took roughly minutes for their food to come Ours took hour and to arrive We did ask the manager how long our food would be before it arrived and was told rudely that people are before us When the food did eventually come it was dry and disgusting We did complain but nothing was done There is no way I would return nor would I advise anyone to come 
negative; Looks quite posh appearances are deceptive though for the prices charged the food is poor the staff are not friendly and welcoming there were loud men swearing and joshing at the bar is it an ale House or an upmarket eatery The vegetarian options are not strictly vegi they have one frier in which the fish is cooked alongside the chips rendering them non vegi 
negative; From frist entering the resturant I felt so unwelcome We were waiting at the door for ages while they cahtted at the till When we were finally noticed a women simply pointed at a tables for us to sit at and went back to the till The food was awful much of it was cold and in a buffet usually a chef replaced food in the trays when it runs out but there was many empty tays out which meant there was actaully very little food There was dirt on the table and the desserts were shocking a chef made mini pancakes which were burnt and there was a chocolate sauce which was basically water I hated having to acatully pay money for the meal  
negative; I just can t believe how many people think the sea food is good here It mostly comes from a freezer I know what a fresh well dressed lobster should be like and what I got wasn t it I was given a refund after much rudeness from the proprietor I guess tourists must think that eating week old crab and frozen seafood from wobbly dirty tables is quaint There are so many better places for seafood in Norfolk 
negative;Arrived at our table for pm waiters slow to help us No coats taken and drinks arrived after mins of ordering Beer classes for the guys had ice in them  With Speckeled hen just isn t right After a long delay in taking orders our starter didn t arrive after an hour so asked if a problem no one helped except a poor young lady rushed off her feet full house upstairs seemed a priority After another half hour we asked to pay for drinks and said we were leaving the manager just shrugged his shoulders We walked out very hungry and unhappy Luckily another local Indian came to our rescue Be warned this is the worst place I ve been too in yrs plus 
negative; Me and my friend stopped here for a drink one night which was a huge mistake We waited patiently at the bar to be served not thinking too much of the fact that one of the bar staff the only one serving at the time was ignoring us and serving everyone else around us What really got me and my friend thinking that maybe this guy was dare I say racist was when he looked directly at us held up a finger to say he d be a minute then proceed to serve this guy who had come in WAY after us I m sure all of us have been at a bar where staff have genuinely missed us because it s been so busy but this guy made a point of not serving us I ve lived in Marlow all my life and have NEVER experienced such blatant racist discriminatory unpleasant behaviour  Luckily the guy who came to help and actually did serve us in the end was professional and friendly Definitely will not be going again 
negative;Thought we would try this pub one Saturday early evening on way back home But was disappointed by the place Firstly it was Saturday night and only had two bar staff and as you order your food at the bar that meant one of the staff was taking food orders leaving one very busy barman to serve everyone else So had to wait mins for a couple of drinks The pub at this point wasn t even that busy However they had about waiting staff for the tables many standing around as there wasn t that many people eating This meant annoyed customers who were waiting ages for a drink but could see other staff with nothing to do Really felt for the two barman they worked their socks off for no thanks from customers or support from the rest of the staff Once food arrived which was quick it wasn t that hot and the scampi was overcooked Also portion sizes unless you have the carvery were on the small side The carvery appear to be the favourite with people piling their plates sky high for value but the one person in our group that had carvery was disappointed as agin is wasn t that hot or cooked very well as the roast spud was hard in the middle  If you want basic pub grub there are better in Ipswich and if you want polite service go elsewhere Will not be going again 
negative;I find it hard to believe that the reviews are so varied on this site I visited this restaurant last night and there is no way anyone would vote this as star Something fishy is going on here The Bolliwood staff have been accused on other sites of writing their own reviews Either that or people have their taste buds removed before they visit I can t remember which curry I ordered but it doesn t matter because they all taste the same There were people in our group and we all ordered different dishes but they all tasted the same bland runny with hardly any meat The staff have no manners and the place is dark has no atmosphere and is over priced I would treat the star reviews with caution and book somewhere else 
negative; Came for a family meal We sat at about table approximately pm and it took  minutes for someone to take our drinks order it was a little busy but not packed They took our meal order and took over an hour for our food to arrive we complained and were assured it was only a minute away but was certainly longer The people in the table next to us complained several times about their food being extremely late too The food was lovely however rather than being a late lunch it was an early dinner Never again I would dread to think what the service was like when the restaurant was full 
negative; Been here a number of times and its definitely going downhill This was days after Christmas and we were with family and friends over from America  Girl on bar seemed surprised to see us even though I d booked that morning then we were handed a poorly typed small menu listing what was available We asked where the normal menu and was told that there hadn t been any deliveries and this was all they had Said that I wasn t happy about this as there hadn t been any mention of a revised menu when I booked the waiter came back saying the chef could try and do something from the original menu and then handed me a list of all the things they didn t have which was pretty much everything At that point we rang the crown in henlow who took our booking with no trouble and were still serving their normal menu  we promptly left and had a excellent meal at THECROWN in HENLOW 
negative;I went to the Society cafe yesterday as we always liked it there but it is awful now Only students on laptops and very loud blaring Indie music all doors to the outside were open and it was very cold The whole atmosphere did not invite to linger and relax so will definitely not go there anymore 
negative; Awful lunch time experience with roast lunch offered pub not very busy but beef advertised but not available at Waited almost hour without any food  later tables served before us but no apology  when chased up two of the four meals arrived but instead of half a roast chicken in was poached no colour breasts  roast potatoes clearly reheated as unable to cut them and tasted horrible cabbage cold Eventually other two meals arrived  one of the chicken breasts pink Chef refused to come out  young staff sent to say it wasn t under cooked and had reached correct temp with probe  disgusting Said we didn t want it  nothing on the plate touched but still had to pay for two of the meals which were hardly touched very poor standard and no flavour Extremely disappointed Thank you to the other two couples on nearby tables who supported us trying to rectify the problems each stage glad one couple left before their food arrived refusing to pay Attitude stinks and do not deserve custom 
negative; Upon arrival we were met by very hostile bar staff struggling to serve anymore than at a time To then be quot barked quot at by an extremely angry barmaid quot if you don t all move away we won t serve you quot A delightful greeting I have never experienced such rudeness shall certainly not be returning Such a shame 
negative; Took our two children here last Summer Food was very basic and tasted like it had just been re heated Also very expensive for what it was No atmosphere and staff were not interested in the slightest Would not recommend 
negative; We were ignored by the staff for minutes and when we asked the waitress to book a table she never returned We then phoned to make a booking and the staff were very dismissive as if we were an inconvenience to them 
negative; Stick with the coffee and toast Highly priced for a cooked breakfast which was woeful in quality No one in our family cleared their plates 
negative; Ridiculous experience last night when the bouncers refused entry to me and friends on my daughter s hen party  We subsequently went to Revolution in the Corner House where the bouncers were lovely and welcomed us in Someone is a little bit power crazy I think 
negative; I visited coffee@ today for lunch with my mother and my week old baby Before we even brought the pram in I popped my head in the door and asked if there was room for us and the pram to which I was greeted with a friendly yes by the male waiter We came in and sat at the table that they directed us to go to two sofas at the front of the cafe  We both had jacket potatoes which were tasty and we both enjoyed Which makes what came next even more frustrating  As soon as we had finished our last mouthfuls a rather abrupt waitress cleared our table and said that if we were going to be long then to move because she was turning away new customers We replied with a smile saying we won t be long because my mum had just a bit of her cup of tea left A minute later two ladies came in for their lunch who were clearly regulars by the way they were greeted and the waitress then came back to our table and asked my mum to move  We were both appalled by the way we were treated fair enough if there was a big group of new customers coming in but for us to be asked to move for only others was out of order Also nobody else was asked to vacate their tables So my mum gulped the last of her tea down while the waitress breathed over my shoulder while I got the pram ready to go Well all I can say extra is that as a recently new resident of Alcester you have lost any future custom from me  
negative; Went here yesterday to have lunch with one of my daughters  I ve not been in a whether spoons pub for a long time because I found their food had gone downhill big time so I thought I d give them another try wish I hadn t bothered now  hadn t wasted my money I had a cheese  tomato panni with chips  my daughter had a hollumi  sweet chilli wrap which is suitable for vegetarians My food was rock hard so I didn t eat it  her s came with soggy lettuce on which wasn t stated on the menu so she didn t eat that either We then ordered chips  cheese for her  when it arrived I ve never seen anything like it before they couldn t even be bothered to melt the cheese  the chips were yet again rock hard to say I was totally disgusted is an understatement so she left that as well I can honestly say I will never set foot back in any whetherspoons establishments again 
negative;We called at Goats on the Roof for a spot of lunch wow wish we hadn t bothered We initially asked for a toasted sandwich but the toaster was broken so we settled for a sandwich which we were informed would be quot rustic bread quot and would come with salad and crisps So we ordered a cheese and pickle and a cheese savory coffee and coke plus coppers What we received was hacked from an ordinary uncut loaf over an inch thick quite dry and with crisps only no salad When we mentioned this we were told quot well you were told it was rustic bread quot  ok where is the salad no reply The only redeeming thing was that the coffee was nice and the coke cold The people running the place didn t seem to know what to do Sadly for such a lovely setting the food left much to be desired needless to say we wont be going back 
negative; I would love to give this pub a good review but I can t even book a table as nobody ever answers the telephone I have signed up to their website for email offers but cannot book a table if nobody will answer the phone As we are travelling from home to Oxford I thought it would be nice to go back to this pub again but something has obviously changed from the last time we were there Therefore I will have to take my business elsewhere 
negative; Well What can I say  my friends and myself have been drinking in the brewery on and off for a long time and enjoyed it very much but the last few times we have found the manager very rude and her people skills are none existent  They have reserved on tables for more than two hours for ten people losing trade because people see reserved and walk out I could understand if the reservation was for food but it wasn t  How do I know Because I was there It is such a lovely building and the beer is good but the management need to learn some people skills  And then it could be the hidden gem in Stamford  Every customer should be as important as the next You don t book a car parking space for more than two hours Not a happy customer 
negative; Worse representation of mexican food ever Last time tasted a chilli as bad as this  was a hot can meal when fishing 
negative; We were seated and asked if we wanted poppadoms straight away before we had looked at the menu We only wanted something light as we had eaten earlier so we picked poppadoms prawn purÇ¸e and onion bargee to share We were asked what main we wanted and we said that was all we wanted We were told we had to order a main I asked where did it say that on the menu The waiter said it doesn t I said so we can t order what we want and he said no  we put down our drinks and left There were four other parties in and you would have thought they would have been pleased with the custom Never before have I been told I can t have what I want from the menu 
negative; I don t think I have ever encountered such rude discourteous staff in my life before We walked out after the starter because the staff were so unbelieveably rude I couldn t eat my lunch as I just wanted to cry I don t understand why these people are working in a customer service industry They would not have been out of place in an episode of Fawlty Towers were it not for the lack of humour 
negative; Not sure if it was the very badly smelling waiter the hours it took for our cooked from frozen burgers to come out or the massive cobwebs on the ceiling but quite frankly I was so embarrassed that I made my poor friends come here Those pictures are no reflection of what is there Good pub food guide should seriously take a trip here 
negative; Ordered a cheeky takeaway tonight and now wish I hadn t I ordered through my just eat app It first said minutes which then changed to hour minutes The food turned up after hour minutes and it was stone cold No joke  the curry and rice was so cold I had to microwave it for three minutes Not a quick blast  three minutes  The Naan was cold and had gone hard where it had dried out My poppadoms was crushed to bits and the yoghurt smelt off  so that went straight in the bin Terrible experience and will certainly never be repeated 
negative; Myself and friends went on Saturday th October they served of the main dishes minuets apart and when they did bring the remaining they were wrong one took yet another attempt to get it right when we complained to the manager we were told its what to expect on a friday or saturday evening as they are busy and cant cope i have since sent emails to their head office and had no reply so clearly customer service is nt high on their priorities They do have my email address though as i ve just received a general email about their new menu As for the music dont get me started  If you do go don t expect any conversation the music is so loud its not surprising the waiting staff get the orders wrong  
negative; No alternative options if you don t like spicy chicken as all chicken is covered in Peru peri seasoning which was way too much for me and I had heart burn and indigestion before we left 
negative; If you like waiting for mins without being acknowledged once by any waiters go here Even if it s not busy I live round the corner and have left this restaurant twice the service was so bad 
negative; Went their with some friends after work and it was quite busy no problem we were happy to wait I asked a blonde female behind the bar how long the wait was and with a visibly bad attitude she asked how many of us their were I replied that there were of us She then asked if we were all there I said yes and that the others were just outside because it was so cramped in the bar She then sarcastically said  quot so you re not all here then quot  more a statement than a question I was then told that the wait would be an hour Rather than be reasonable and allow you to wait at the pub which is immediately next door I was told that we would have to wait in the tiny cramped bar or outside in the rain  I decided that I would do neither and went to Bodeans instead where the wait was just as long but they text you to tell you when your table is ready and you can even monitor your progress in the queue online 
negative; We popped in here on the way to St Albans for lunch and I wish we hadn t We all ordered cheese on toast and we waited and waited and eventually it arrived but what a disappointment Once slice of thin sliced poor quality supermarket bread with cheese on top a thin slice of cucumber a quarter of tomato and a couple of pieces of lettuce I asked for a latte coffee but it was just a milky coffee and not even that nice It s a shame really as the place has potential 
negative; Lifeless horrible pub with vulgar clientele and an overall bad atmosphere Shame really because the pub itself has lots of potential and apparently has the best garden of all three pubs I got the feeling that this was more of a regulars pub for people who like sky sport lots of swearing and getting absolutely tanked up with the odd fight at the end of a night Even though there is a children play area I certainly didn t get the feel it was a family pub There are two much nicer pubs in the village which I m sure the locals are really grateful for  
negative;My partner and I went to this pub for a quiet early evening meal a favourite pub of ours for a drink and meal On this occasion it was over run with dogs and my partner complained that the staff were petting the dogs whilst waiting table A dog owner took offence and started to threaten and verbally abuse us My partner was threatened with being thrown in the canal and then invited to go around the corner in order that the aggressive man could knock six bells out of him Nothing was done to support us apparently they are regulars We left and the aggressive people stayed on drinking I feel they should have been asked to leave and that we are owed an apology Needless to say we shall not be returning 
negative;Very poor breakfast which was swimming in grease cold and tasteless Very friendly staff it s the food that is the let down 
negative;We came across this restaurant with a deal through Wowcher which sounded great and a total bargain as me and my partner enjoy Indian alot We visted on and we re very diasappointed Firstly the restaurant was just one room which was rather cramped and heated by a gas heater by the door we got seated and looked through the menu The menu looked amazing with lots of different choices and the classics you expect to see at an Indian I ordered a chicken korma and my partner ordered a spicy lamb dish the korma did not taste like a korma what so ever and there were no naans available only chappatis The music was so repetative it drove me crazy  Overall worst Indian experience ever would never consider going again and i would not pay full price for a meal here 
negative;We decided to go to Corriander for a family meal with a group of children On their website it is advertised kids eat free on Sunday s When we asked for this deal we were asked to provide a voucher there was nothing on the website to print off or no explanation a voucher was needed  I was passed phone twice to speak to a colleague  manager Eventually agreed to meals but paying for the rest  Ruined a family celebration with so many excellent restaurants to choose from in Manchester  Cholrton we will most definitely be going anywhere but corriander 
negative; My partner and I arrived at pm on We were half hour early for our original booked table for pm but they were not busy so managed to seat us The member of staff that seated us wanted to take our drinks request there and then but I hadnt taken my coat off so we asked for mins Then mins later laura the waitress came over to take our order we ordered coke  sparkling wine one haddock chips and peas and one sunday roast beef mins after placing the order our drinks arrived and mins after that our food arrived The roast beef was served with runner beans  slices or carrots Dried up roast potatoes  roast parsnips and cold yorkshire pudding The roast beef was very nice however it would of been even more sublime if served with hot veg and not just a few and a hotter yorkshire pudding Gravy was nice but again cold  The haddock was very greasy and after picking out + large bones My partner gave up after only eating a quarter of the haddock We understand fish has bones however a good chief would of prepped his fish surely The chips were stone cold and the peas were actually perfect but tepid warm  The service was good by laura except for waiting for our drinks We advised laura that we wouldnt be paying for the fish  chips and this was granted by the manager  We wont be visiting again 
negative; I and many of my friends and family have been eating here for years or more and for seafood and friendly service it has never been faulted I went there and tonight for the first time in all those years I have sworn never to go there again  it was not as if it was busy We spent a sizeable amount of money and were rushed through our meal the whole time  infact the rest of my party were presented with the dessert menu while I was still finishing my main course I have never experienced service so bad and have sworn never to go there again I am heart broken after all these years to be denied one of my favourite restaurants but I am sad to say  this Fast food  mentality is a growing trend these days 
negative;Only in Britain could a pub with such bad customer service still be in business My partner and I called in for a pint after getting soaked on a bike ride to be told at the bar that it was closed We were a bit confused as it was full of people eating at the time  and the door had been open Thirsty we pleaded to the bar man s better nature and said we only wanted a quick drink but the answer was still no Bar man then changed his mind and said we could have a pint but would have to stand outside to drink it It was pouring down with rain at the time And freezing cold Charming After recovering our emotions from this magnificent offer of kindness we left Glanced around long enough to see how dark dingy and miserable it was though Will definitely not be going back here 
negative; Ordered food for a night in Food delivered ontime but the sweet  sour sauce missing for the chicken balls Called immediately and the lady on the phone asked did we want it now we said of course we do otherwise our food will go cold Waited minutes at which point we called back The lady said the sauce was on its way but we said the food is now cold she said there was nothing she could do about it as they had already had to pay the driver an addition We said that s not our problem the driver should have come straight back but she said he had to get petrol Again we said not our problem would you pay for food to go cold she replied the food is not cold Well how does she know this We said again the food is cold and she said she can t do anything about it Absolutely disgusted in their very poor customer service and will not be spending my money their again I suggest they have their staff complete some customer service training and double check they are sending out the correct orders in future 
negative; Arrived around  and told we were going to have to wait minutes to be seated which was mildly annoying but ok Our only option was to have an over priced drink at the bar and listen to the extra loud music that in fact was so deafening you could hardly hear yourself think let alone have a conversation Fifty minutes came and went with a promise that in another mins a table would be available Finally sat down at By this time we were starving and tired from standing up for the past one and three quarter hours The food was ok but would have been far better if it had all come at the same time On both courses our waiter only brought out three of the four meals that we had ordered leaving one person having to wait Another problem was that the food was cold and slightly over cooked I m sure that TGI Friday s in the States would be absolutely apalled  
negative;I have been to this restaurant several times since it has been open This time was terrible I had just flew back from visiting family in Spain and my partner said we will go out for dinner So we drove to the mandarin restaurant it was very early evening as we walked in there where people on the door the place was quite empty the person in charge Manager I believe  we said we hadn t booked the Manager said we could come in but had to be out in an hour and half we where shown to a table furthest from the layout off the food round the corner on our own  as much as we wanted to stay we did not like being told that we had to be out in an hour and half also where we where sat to eat So we left Not happy The worst treatment have ever had from there 
negative;Peeling tables uninspired food uncomfortable but relatively cheap I would not return Be good for a stag do 
negative;I decided to go for my birthday and Gosh where should I even start it looks like a decent place on the outside then when you go in the restaurant it s looks like an absolute mess in there it s looks so cheap and then the food was cold either dry or really soggy none of the food was nice AT ALL  There is hardly any choice of food either My drink tasted dodgy my friend asked for a fanta and it tasted and looked nothing like fanta it was all watery and nasty and when we asked if it was actually fanta the woman said yes when clearly we could see if wasn t The staff were just so moody and I wouldn t recommend this restraunt to anyone it made me feel sick after eating it Also the seat was covered in duct tape and looked all tatty and horrible PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
negative; We had a provisional reservation for large Christmas party and were waiting for a call back for a deposit to secure it I called the restaurant FOUR times and was assured everything was under control Finally today we got a call and were told that there was no availability even though we already had a booking Kylie was great when I spoke to her but a man there completely screwed up the reservation for our entire Christmas party and rather than being apologetic was rude I have spent a good deal of money in The Living Room over the years as the food and cocktails are actually very good However it s impossible to feel happy going somewhere you are not looked after The is plenty of choice in Manchester particularly with an influx of excellent new restaurants and cocktail bars in Spinningfields on top of everything we already had Not good enough watch out guys there are plenty of people snapping at your heels I certainly won t be bothering coming to your place again we are looking forward to spending a lot of money in Piccolino s instead : 
negative; Had a meal there last night very disappointed with the menu choice  having chosen a chicken salad thinking can t go wrong with that my salad arrived with no dressing as described on the menu the pub had no Mayo can you believe a pub with no mayo so eventually I got served a MUG of salad dressing I cut into my rubber piece of chicken ate pieces and then found that the middle was raw  not just pink actual raw meat I took it back got an apology and replacement mins later but had to ask for it to be taken off the bill and not very professionally the bar man asked his manager in front of us the paying customer if he was allowed to take it off not this chap s fault at all and the manager proceeded to tell him off in front of us and didn t acknowledge us at all or apologise They did take of the for the salad Needless to say don t go there definitely don t eat there they need to learn some manners and the chef needs a lesson in how to cook chicken if I become ill from the raw chicken they will be hearing from me again July 
negative; Service was very good  polite and friendly Russian lady :  However the food was dreadful Tasteless frozen processed rubbish Would not recommend at all Do not waste your time going 
negative; Hardly a pleasant welcome of an awful smell of Brussels sprouts as we entered the porch of the pub and a smell of some air freshener coming from somewhere which smelt like those horrible toxic ones they use in toilets Basically it was like being inside a toilet instead of a pub restaurant  The place was extremely hot and so uncomfortable the radiators where blasting out so much heat They were even on inside the ladies toilets  Our night with friends was ruined because of this discomfort and I have to say none of us would rush back 
negative; I ordered the ice coffee and it was too watery The I saw them prepare it for another customer and it was a full cup of water with ice and a just a little amount of coffee Disgusting Not real iced coffee Very bad 
negative; Had lunch here  it was dire Old fashioned overcooked and belongs in the s This is not an Italian restaurant it s a truly awful attempt 
negative; Absolutely disguised at this place tonight Table booked and taken straight too it but not offered to order drinks had to get the lovely waitresses eye to order bottle of white wine not chilled so had to ask for ice Main course arrived jacket with butter but no butter in sight so off to the salad bar then disaster struck when I turned over my gammon to find a chicken wishbone again waitress couldn t be more helpful if asked but was instructed by management to refund and offer an alternative meal as if Manager came over all apologetic but that was all Thanks for spoiling my treat meal for my teenager who s looked after me for the past weeks whilst being seriously ill will we be back Not till hell freezes over 
negative; We had a table booked for people on a saturday evening for a friends birthday celebration and we were all looking forward to a tapas meal  We were seated at : and the first dishes didnt come out until :pm We had all ordered dishes each and one person ordered a main meal Dishes came out or at a time and a few our group were left waiting with no food at all whilst other members were politely waiting to start expecting everyones food to arrive at the same time Food was going cold so some of us ate our tapas whilst still waiting for our other dishes which didnt seem to be coming  We complained that some of the group had had no food at all and a couple more dishes arrived but not all of them The person who had ordered a main meal still had no food arrive at :pm and was leaving at pm so cancelled her order meanwhile others were still waiting on the remainder of their dishes  In the end we said cancel the rest as it was getting late and the food coming out was luke warm  The staff were apologetic and were good enough to take some money off the bill and give us a round of free drinks but overall a very disappointing experience especially as it was a birthday celebration We left hungry and disappointed 
negative; I visited yesterday evening at pm with my family and our children I can not tell you what the food was like as we left quite soon after arriving The landlord didn t appreciate or children being there as we took colouring things for them to keep them occupied All children were sat nicely and the other customers commented on the good behaviour I was told it was not a play school and that when he [the landlord] was a child he didn t go out for pub meals I explained that I had been a mother for years and have never had this problem He refunded my drink [a coke] and we left all the other customers in the dining area all looked shocked and added that they hadn t complained in anyway This was a shame as it was my brothers birthday and we wanted a nice family tea on our doorstep My brother has also left a fab review on the th october what a shame is all I can say 
negative; We went along as we fancied a chinese and this was the only one in the area They had a buffet deal on and it looked like good value We should ve realised when it was really quiet that it was going to be disappointing The starters came worringly quickly within a couple of minutes and they tasted fine Then my husband asked for some tap water and was given a glass of warm water with floating bits in it which he obviously didn t touch We then waited about minutes for them to take our mains order which we wish they hadn t We had crispy chilli beef which tasted like poor quality pork scratching dipped in chilli sauce The rice was really greasy and overdone Of course when they asked us how it was we told them it was fine and vowed to slate them on trip advisor later  I probably won t visit Belper again but anyone who does  do your stomach a favour and avoid this restaraunt 
negative; Ordered a Cheese Ploughmans from Specials board Boy that was a big mistake it was a cheese salad with sliced Apple Even had to ask for some bread was handed a floury bap Think someone needs to google what a Ploughmans really is Shame because they usually have good hearty meals 
negative;Met up with my friend for a very long awaited evening out and came across Bellota Being a lovely evening we chose to sit outside and ordered a chilled bottle of cava and half a dozen tapas The waitress was very friendly and helpful and the cava superb Unfortunately that s where our positive s end We waited just over an hour for our food  for tapas  And when it did arrive the food was not hot just barely warm  Extremely disappointing We did have dishes knocked off our bill when we complained but the damage had been done It wasn t as thought they were really busy as there was nobody sitting outside and we noticed a couple of parties get up and leave as their orders had not been taken 
negative; Was so looking forward to my Birthday treat and my first experience of afternoon tea What a disappointment and such a let down The exterior of the building is so impressive but such a shame the interior does not match up It was a very cold dreary November afternoon and was hoping for a warm cosy ambience however the rooms felt cold and uninviting no ambient lighting flowers etc  there were two Christmas trees there completely bare of any decoration and the place felt like a morgue even the staff were completely cold and devoid of any personality The food appeared to be shelf bought and cut up into small portions not freshly prepared and lacking in any kind of presentation Half way through our meal we had to find a member of staff and request our pots of tea as none had arrived We also had to request jam for the scones At no time did anyone ask if everything was to our liking and therefore a total lack of service The only thing that made the experience enjoyable was the company I was with Will not be returning 
negative; Myself and friends went to Devils Dyke restaurant on Sunday th Feb at about pm My friend orders a steak and found a piece of polythene in his meal around the edge of his steak I showed the waitress who made no comment and just walked off No one came to talk to us or apologise when we got home my friend started being sick I will not be eating at the Devils Dyke again 
negative; I was really excited to visit this restaurant thinking it would be like Cosmo s or Buddha Belly s However unfortunately the food was basically tasteless microwave food left out to go cold Bland dry undercooked this restaurant Is seriously lacking 
negative; love our curries and like to eat around and decided to have a take away from here as looked nice and is local Its the worst ive ever eaten Bland food felt like i was eating cream Popadoms were stail and garlic naan had no taste either Very dissapointed as prices were very high also wont be going here again in a hurry 
negative; Lovely venue The food is so very average Disappointing It s not cheap either Weird bones that looked like dog chews with the steak Very unattractive The steak and mushroom pie didn t compare to a Waitrose pie The portions were generally very stingy The staff were okay Functional Not one iota of charm or friendliness We thought it would be great It wasn t 
negative;We have been coming here for years and today we visited and found it has changed owners can safely say that was our last visit the new owners have obviously cheaped out on the food time to find somewhere new 
negative;Perhaps the other Spaghettihouse restaurants would have offered a better experience but the one in Covent Garden was a hazard to the restaurant world From the moment I entered I did not like it It looked like someone had made a great effort to get a central location but not thinking of the customers The place is very crowded so crowded that people from other tables are joining in the conversations There is no privacy The customer service is non existent the waiter who served us was extremely arrogant and very abrupt with his answers to simply questions No smiles no desire to be there Our order was taken quickly and the food arrived quickly as well but it was horrible The pizza was impossible to chew and the starters were the most basic food you can ever get They were tasteless and badly presented We were not able to finish the food and the waitress was trying to convince us to order other starters and mains We have to explain that the food was not as great as she anticipated She was kind enough not to charge us for the main and one of a starter but she made sure that we were aware of how much money she withdrew from the bill and kept saying it is more than half of the bill  My only recommendation is not to try this place This is not a real restaurant it is just a way to get money from people 
negative; Terrible service and a supercilious manager spoiled years of dining out at this restaurant I should have been alerted to the fact that this really is a FISH restaurant when Maiken the swedish waitress said that it was quot not possible quot to have the Sunday roast beef quot medium rare quot  Which was decidedly odd However I persevered  mins later slices of beef with the textured pallor of that left too long on the sideboard and congealed by gravy appeared It was sent back Mery [ ] brought it back and huffily said that quot all the food here is fine quot  When asked if the dish could be changed she said she could not possibly prioritise the new order despite my guests already being served their mains When asked to see the Manager she said quot I AM the manager quot  Alas Mery you have been rumbled you are merely the ASSISTANT manager She gave a different name when asked for her name card and since quot Daniel quot is male I asked Maiken for the Manager s name and was bluntly told quot Ask her yourself quot  When Mery then realised we might complain about the service she said quot the fish and chips are fast quot  The fried fish was fine but please Mery in this country a soupÇõon of graciousness goes a long way when serving and never ever promote yourself above your station 
negative; My friends came in last night for a meal and paid deposits per head One of us could not make it and the girls told the staff about the meal BUT YOU STILL brought out the starter they laughed and said they had already told you BUT THEN YOU STILL BROUGHT OUT THE MAIN  They argued with you about this but you still told the birthday girl she would have to pay So tell me why you pay a deposit if you still bring out the food and charge the party the full amount The whole point of paying a deposit is if something crops up and someone cant make it I E LAST NIGHT You still get something towards the place and NOT TO COOK THE FOOD but your staff still went ahead with  Absolutely shocking I wont be coming here again  This is poor 
negative;Whilst the bar is impressive it fell far short of the pleasant experience I was hoping for Having been on my list of must go to bars I was really looking forward to trying this bar out What should have been a pleasant and fun evening was completely let down by the staff I was really disappointed by the unfriendly and unhelpful attitude of the employees which completely ruined our evening My partner and I will not be returning in a hurry 
negative; My Wife and I dropped into Molly s for a bite to eat on a chilly day The food was not very nice pretty plain for the price we were charged which was way too much in my opinion  It appears shabby inside and I found the staff cold towards us why we have no idea honestly When I approached the till area to pay for our orders rather than stay and be stated at coldly I was looked up and down by the woman there she was very curt and rather rude for no reasons I hardly spoke to the woman at all I dropped a coin and bent to pick it up I was subject to the woman on the till craning over the counter staring at what I was doing I felt like I was treated like a potential thief  For Heavens sake I had never been in there before nor did I know any staff member there I will tell you this I will not be going back again nor will my Wife Save your money their attitude is you should be grateful 
negative;No words can describe how bad the food here is Even the BBQ chicken was oozing blood The ribs uncooked tough and the size of dogs bones Would have sent them back but the waiters are like buses  two come along then you don t see one for ages Service non existent Then % service on your bill If you have to go just have a drink x
negative; We booked a table for pm late i know but we had tickets for a show on new years eve via the website when booking i was given the option to book the a lacarte menu or the set menu we decided to go for the a lacarte as the set menu was  each  The show got out earlier than we expected so after a quick drink over the road we went across to the restaurant  Upon arriving they made it very clear that we were the last people of the night and not made very welcome to be honest  we were then given the set menu on our table when i asked for the a lacarte menu as booked we were told that they wernt serving from that menu after pm and the set menu was the only option As we didnt want to pay  each we had to leave which left us with nothing to eat on the streets of manchester at pm at night Had we known we couldnt order off the regular menu to start with we would never have booked here and either booked elsewhere or at least had more chance of getting in somewhere at pm when the show finished the website should have never let us book the a lacarte option when it was unavailable therefore ruining our new year and ending up with a mcdonalds where the satff were alot friendlier back at our hotel 
negative;Went here for a birthday meal what a disappointment If you read the menu before you go do not expect to find the range of food advertised you get what they decide to put on It is not quality food and seems to be for the masses cheap and easily cooked Staff are trying to take your plates before you have even finished eating and your glasses before they are empty  For per person there are much better quality places to eat A real disappointment 
negative; Attended a party where butlers in the buff were serving should have been a fun night if the bar staff hadn t over charged us for our drinks by for each drink for a lime and soda for a black coffee Outrageous What a con  Food was mediocre garlic bread cold bruschetta bread cold and chewy The list goes on  Never again will I go there to be charged over inflated prices for not so good food and drinks 
negative; We stopped off at Spicer and Cole today for a quick coffee before heading home We ordered our coffees and waited at our table for service The man came over and dumped out coffee s on the table didn t even take the time to place them Very rude And the manner he spoke in was rude as well Made us very unwelcome Further more the coffee itself was not the best very sour for an Americano Next time I will be using a different coffee shop 
negative; I went for a meal and the landlord was incredibly rude Felt he didn t want me there as I wasn t local The place stank and was cold Mainly smelt of urine Definitely avoid and go to the Beaver instead 
negative; I ordered with Maha through Hungry House and paid via PayPal An hour later I was called by a very rude man at the restaurant who said he would not be processing my order as he did not understand PayPal I asked him to take that up with Hungry House directly as I had paid them and he refused to call them I had to call and arrange a refund I have very hungry children and will not use Maha again after the way I was spoken too 
negative;Been going here for years Years ago I would say this was top notch Went last night for tea with my partner Mains fetched out together I had the turkey ham and leek pie I lifted the lid of the pie which wasn t actually pastry as stated in the menu it was suet dumplin It consisted of small chunks of ham and the rest leek No turkey in site Told the waitress who took my plate away and mins later fetched me a new one With a quot little quot more filling I then asked for fresh veg which was frozen cabbage and carrots and more gravy A further minutes I waited By this time my partner had eaten his meal So much for a tea together I asked for a drink with no ice but it arrived at the table with ice I couldn t eat my meal as it was literally a plate of leeks with a dumplin The waitress gave me the bill and I refused to pay for my meal Didn t feel like I should pay for it but she said she would have to get the landlady Well what can I say  This rude abrupt arguementative thing came out Told me I was rude for coming to her pub eating her food and refusing to pay I calmly tried to explain that I did wish to eat with my partner and she basically said tough Told me I had to pay I then said no I will not I hardly ate any of mine She then told me it was theft and I d stolen her food as we had eaten it Asked for my name and address which I refused to give her Age was extremely loud shouting I m rude Embarrassing herself as this place has gone down hill She then shouted an I going to pay so I point blanked said no Told me to get out and never return THANK GOD it was awful To top it off I ve been up for two hours being sick and feel I have food poisoning Stay away from this place Rude landlady with no people skills dirty 
negative; My friend and I booked the Groupon for waffles and a hot drink at the Piccadilly Plaza branch We saw the most recent reviews on here before we went but thought we should check it out for ourselves Particularly as I had been told by the Ashton branch that the cafÇ¸ was attached to a newsagents Unfortunately the reviews are % accurate  The cakes on display in a cabinet looked very sorry for themselves There was no sign of a waffle or a hot drink machine in site Moreover there was nowhere to sit or even perch Definitely not what I would describe as a cafÇ¸ attached to a newsagents  I m not sure why this was Groupon deal was ever offered When you buy a deal that sells itself as a waffle with a hot drink at a bakery you at least expect there to be a table to sit at We were so appalled we walked out without redeeming our Groupon and have requested a full refund I think Trifles will regret offering their goods at this location 
negative; We stayed at wonderful Treganna castle and visited the Halsetown Inn for our th Anniversary meal as we had read such good reviews on Trip Advisor Oh my goodness it was the worst meal I have ever had I always complain when something is wrong but because the night was so special to us I just couldn t bear the fuss The beetroot fennel carrot and avocado salad I had to start with had NO avocado the slices of beetroot were so thin you could read a paper through them  fennel seeds and the plate filled up with salad leaves My Duck confit should have read duck coffin as that was probably where it belonged the beans I guess were called aldente but I prefer to say all dead so tough and hard you had a job to get a knife through them My husbands Thai omelette must have been made with pigeons egg as you could barely see it the plate was filled with noodles and bits and pieces  both were tasteless We didn t risk a sweet just called a taxi and went back to Treganna Whilst we waited for a taxi we had coffees the only thing we had that night that was acceptable The serviettes I wouldn t have used in a porto loo the whole place was not very clean or wholesome The taxi driver told us they had lost their regular chef but I m afraid that s no excuse for meal I wouldn t have paid a tenner for We celebrated our th the next night in the dining room of Treganna castle a beautiful meal wonderful service and immaculate cleanliness St Ives has a Jewel in Treganna but the Halsetown Inn is a thorn in it s side 
negative; My fiancÇ¸ and I came for a quick Thursday dinner and had the worst experience ever  When chicken wings cost you expect something better than average but It was just microwaved plain unless oil is sauce or seasoning wings Super overpriced  My fiancÇ¸ had pasta  probably the worst pasta in his life and definitely the last meal at Henry s ever  My food was clearly microwaved and so not worth the price  We would never eat here again 
negative; For our th wedding anniversary we decided to take a trip out and was disgusted by the food Gammon was and it was swimming with grease it was sent back for another then the egg was so undercooked the slime in the egg made me feel sick And the gammon was tough and very fatty When this was sent back we asked for our money back and they refused My husband was offered a pudding as compensation I would not recommend this pub to anyone in the future and will be writing a complaint to King Henry s taverns Once I get back home 
negative; I read reviews and decided to give this place a try It was awful My mum had the share platter as she is not a big eater and we could all pick at it It was burnt to a crisp Half of the food was unrecognisable We had no idea if it was prawn or mushroom or pepper I complained and was offered free pudding for one person Their were in our group I also said to the waitress who was lovely that I would like to speak to the manager apparently he was to busy I could see him behind the bar My husband has hunters chicken This was dry and like string with the cheese and sauce on top The fish and chips was good Outside play area for children I complained online to the hungry horse franchise and again was sent a free dessert voucher Please avoid The chef cook needs training on cooking times I will never be back 
negative; Really unpleasant staff who demanded we put our pushchair down even though there was no one around us and it had been stowed out of the way They watched in disgust as we unloaded buckets spades etc to fold it down  NO kids menu  we were just told we could get an extra plate and share My quiet we ll behaved girls pushed the buttons on the fruit machine right next to our table and the barmaid came over and told them to stop in a v unpleasant way  Don t mind un child friendly places but st Ives harbour in August I don t understand why they would bother to alienate what must be they re key clientele 
negative; We have used forest inn regularly in the past  but on our last visit the food was really bad and service not much better If you do decide to go don t have the BBQ bucket All our meals were cold will never go back again 
negative; We was really looking forward to eating here as we had walked past it many times and been tempted by the lush looking cakes in the window Finally we decided that we d go in for a spot of lunch and in all honesty it was terrible The sandwich wasn t fresh pre packaged and tasteless and I ordered the carrot and coriander soup which arrived in a paper cup and tasted like it had been watered down Everything arrived with plastic knives and forks or paper cups  totally disappointed Normally I would go back and try it again but the experience was terribly awful 
negative; Have been here a number of times previously for take aways and always been satisfied However after our takeaway last week my other half was very ill Avoid the duck We won t be coming back 
negative; Went to the brasshouse for dinner just before our concert I asked for medium rare steak came out well done It took minutes and by the point we were in quite a rush so I didn t take it back My friend and I quite fancied a sundae each rocky road and profiteroles one Took minutes for us to feel a little confused as to why taking so long we went to the till to find out it hasn t even been done They bring it out wrong we send it back and then they bring it out again with what we asked not to be on the ice cream as I am allergic Staff were argumentative when we were explaining what was wrong  minutes for an ice cream Also the restaurant was so dark we couldn t really see properly I d never come here again 
negative;We called in here for breakfast on my birthday on the th September on the way down to London I must say not a great experience after paying for breakfast and coffee we went through to eat st we went to where we were to help ourselves to coffee only to find that there was none I had to return to the bar to ask for some and milk  the coffee was bought out minutes later I had to again ask for milk placed our drinks on to the table and on to the food we had to ask for plates as these too had ran out someone came and placed the plates at the buffet area the first plate was badly stained and dirty we had to sift through the plates to find a clean one as did the other people in the line The food itself was ok but many things missing and just warm not hot the coffee was really strong you pay extra for coffee tea and fruit juices We wouldn t go back 
negative;Over attentive service but despite that the main courses all came at separate times so some of us had finished before the last course arrived which was cold so had obviously been hanging around The fish we ordered had been cooked twice so extremely dry We then got the bill and the wine we had ordered had been replaced with a bottle costing Overall a very bad experience so just be careful when visiting and ordering wine 
negative; Me and my family visited on in the afternoon We arrived and wanted to seat outside There were two tables not occupied outside both were abandoned and not cleaned with rubbish on the tables food drinks We stood outside for a while and assuming someone will come and clean and seat us they could see ciustomers waiting as place wasnt that busy After noone even noticed us my husband went to call someone from inside to come and clean Another mins we were waiting and still noone he went back again to ask the table to be cleaned Super poor customer service we had to beg to be noticed and seated Everything was so dirty we went inside to order floor looked disgusting covered with food We did our order wanted some dressing and water of course it was never served we had to go and ask again No personal attention to customers i believe Mcdonalds will serve you better Once you pay and seat they forget about you Always in a rush even if you want to make eye contact to ask sth they avoid you  We have been there before customer service wasnt great as well but the last time was extremely poor Will avoid 
negative; Visit today for lunch with friends The staff were clearly selected for their looks not personality or intellect  First challenge a pint of Peroni The girl couldn t work out which tap was which despite the Peroni handle  Next challenge taking a lunch order for a group of  We all received our food at different times despite ordering together Items were missing extra items brought that we had not requested I ordered a chicken skewers note the plural of skewers salad What I got was a bowl of lettuce a couple of slivers of mozzarella and skewer of chicken Had to ask for dressing and for the mozzarella which was missing  Next stop the toilets which can only be described as grim I actually had to make a toilet paper seat cover as it was so grubby If the front of house was so dirty it makes me scared what the kitchen is like On the plus side I doubt there was sufficient chicken in my salad to make me ill To summarise avoid at all costs 
negative; Having arranged to meet for lunch today with my friend her week old and year old daughters We walked from Market Walk car park to Italian Cottage only to be told we could not bring the pram inside We asked to move a chair from a table for and place the pram in the space but apparently it is company policy not to allow prams The restaurant was empty other than one table of four and considering it was pm at lunchtime and they only serve lunch pm it was unlikely to get much busier We then had to find somewhere else to eat and decided on Cosmopolitan who could not have been more accommodating The food was lovely and the service impeccable Definitely my restaurant of choice from now on and one I would happily recommend  Judging from the comments on Facebook today about our treatment I don t think we ll be the only ones boycotting Italian Cottage I m not surprised the restaurant was deserted if this is how they treat their customers 
negative; We ve visited this Toby Carvery several times and each time we ve come away feeling disappointed The first time we visited we took my mother in law She wanted to order a child s plate as she doesn t have a big appetite When she asked the waitress if she could have a child s plate the answer was really negative stating that this was Toby policy that adults can only have adult sized plates This is total nonsense as we have visited other Toby s in the country that were far more accommodating The other times we have visited we ve been shocked by the terribly slow service ignored by staff when we tried to order we gave up and went to the servery ourselves 
negative; We along with our teenage foster children decided to try out the Sunday buffet as advertised outside the restuarant On arrival we were asked to wait quite a long time  by a waiter who did not look particularly happy to see us Eventually we were invited to our seats Courses were brought out to our table despite us asking for the buffet as advertised We were informed this was the way the chef did it The poppadums came with dips a cheap tasting mango chutney which was ok and a bright green one that tasted of flour and water very nasty The starter was a pile of greasy fried things along with onion bhajis but was hard to identify what was what We said two of us were vegetarian and were told there were mushrooms in amongst the fried chicken lumps We requested seperate starters and they did bring out some different greasy tasteless vegetables The main course came on a cold metal tray seperated into sections I was given prawns in one section of mine with the announcement this was quot vegetarian meal quot  The other two selections were inedible completely tasteless and watery The rice was dry and chewy and not very hot The naan bread was like cardboard cut into triangles and again completely tasteless It was truly revolting None of us could manage more than a forkful or two We complained to the waiter that we weren t happy but he just said the food was freshly cooked and asked if we wanted more We declined We were charged the full amount even though we had not been able to eat the food  what a waste of Never again  avoid this place at all costs A sad introduction to Indian food for our teenagers They said they wished we had gone to McDonalds  the opposite of what we had hoped to achieve 
negative;I have just returned from the most awful Prezzo meal I have ever experienced Our party of went to Prezzo restaurant in Anchor Square Bristol Monday rd December for a Christmas lunch I ordered the Pollo Spinaci which should have had chargrilled chicken breast advocado roasted pepper cucumber cherry tomatoes and spinach leaves What I got was tiny strands of chicken  small cubes of advocado  cherry tomatoe cut in half  cubes of cucumber and a bowl full of spinach My two friends both ordered Fusilli Gorgonzola which should have contained seasoned chicken pancetta bacon leeks broccoli in a gorgonzola and cream sauce What they got was a bowl full of fusilli  tiny slices of chicken one broccoli floret and a small strand of bacon there was no sauce  We complained and asked for some sauce which took minutes to arrive at which point the pasta was cold and the sauce we received was barely warm We asked to see the manager as we were not prepared to pay for the pasta dishes however the manager declined to speak to us and just removed the pasta dishes from the final bill My other friend had the Chicken bacon  advocado salad which was fine Our lunch was a complete none event and we didn t even receive an apology from the manager No wonder this was the only restaurant we could get in at such short notice  I have to say I am a regular Prezzo customer and the food is generally a high standard but I will definitely not be returning to this particular restaurant Avoid at all costs would be my recommendation 
negative; Called in for lunch and was surprised as we didn t have to wait long for a table Went to the toilet and they were filthy  While having our meal I noticed the cobwebs on the windows They looked like safety nets: All the glass in the place was mortifying Skirting boards were disgusting The carpet looked as if it hadn t been cleaned for a day or  Needless to say we won t be returning 
negative;I booked Brasserie Blanc for a pre wedding celebration dinner for my friends I booked and picked a table near the window with a view if Jericho When we got there the table was already taken so they chose another table around the back in the corner for which they didn t seem to mind that this mistake had happened We ordered a selection of starters and I had esgargos when we had finished the waitress spilt the garlic and herb butter sauce over my partners Jeans which she then denied Our Waitress really seemed not to want us in there and was quite rude with us We ordered mains and the steak I ordered was so tough that the table was shaking while I attempted to cut it  I sent it back and although they did offer me something else everyone else had finished eating My partner went and spoke with the waitress to say how our experience had been and she offered us free deserts we didn t take up the offer as we already had such a bad experience that we just wanted to pay and leave I really don t want to stay and eat somewhere where the waitress was being abrupt and rude So we paid and left It really topped it off when I was sick the next day So not the celebration it should have been 
negative; Food is okay but you can sit and wait all day to get served and no one will come over to you No cutlery on table no one asked whether our food was okay or not and eventually gave up on waiting to order desserts Staff are very unhelpful Overall very poor 
negative;The theatre needs to rethink its restaurant We keep trying it but it never fails to disappoint Usually the menu sounds good but always lets us down I do not know of anyone who enjoys it and only eats there for the convenience of being so near to the theatre which I think they rely on and so do nothing to upgrade it As yet the manager has not commented on any negative criticism 
negative;Cheap nasty and so full fat that I felt sick within minutes of eating a sausage roll  Never again 
negative; Visited the spread eagle on a Wednesday night with the family After not eating there for years due to bad experiences we decided it maybe worth a shot The food was nice enough Average food for a pub the hunters chicken which id vowed not to eat from there as it was always a disappointment proved me wrong  the only negative was I had to ask for more barbecue sauce BUT  The service which is always an issue there was terrible Bearing in mind it was pretty quiet it took quite a while for the waitress to take our order over minutes for the starters to arrive then I d say an additional minutes waiting around for the mains Upon following up on the progress the staff where pretty unhelpful and developed a disgusting attitude Not once were we asked how things were did we want any sauces or did we want any water  After a really disappointing night the staff could not even say bye as we paid  left It is a real shame as that place could be perfect but they ve never quite got the service right  
negative;Order a meal from thier to be delivered It was discussing and make me and my family physically sick When complained about the meal they offered me a refund and said of thier drivers would drop of They then dropped of the refund days later and gone at night Won t be ordering again
negative;Just eaten at the Bellflower with my Daughter Grand daughter and Great Grand daughter The menu says meals are two for one but states quite clearly that if you but two meals from the specials board which are more expensive the cheaper one is free My Grand daughter bought a burger and a child s meal from the main menu My Daughter and I chose from the more expensive specials board When the bill arrived the cheaper burger had been deducted and both meals from the specials board were charged in full On challenging the staff I was told that the cheaper meal was the one to be deducted no matter which menu it was from as it was based on the overall bill  Word of advice if more than two are in your party make sure that you order in separate pairs to avoid this blatant rip off The salmon I had was very dry and the potatoes brown and hard as were the ones my daughter had Definitely would not eat there again 
negative;So family recently moved to the local area and after research on trip advisor we discovered Monsoon valley We thought we would order a nice take away as we had been working all day  Well The food was atrocious The Passanda chicken was a dark brown runny slop which tasted of pure nuts Ive never in my life tasted indian food so terrible  My partner who grew up in London and has eaten indian food for over years couldn t even take a nd mouthful Infact we couldn t even give it away Our teenage sons couldn t even eat it  they eat pretty much anything Honestly please don t waste your money like we did completely chucked in the bin Words just can t explain if the photos weren t on my phone id upload them to show you the colours of the dishes The English girl on the phone took about minutes to take our order they didn t even know what pakora chicken was and didn t even offer it on there menu Delivery driver was polite Owner was polite but didn t offer any reimbursement he replaced the Passanda  If we collected it but it was even WORST LOL  AVOID 
negative; Although the food was ok when we finally got it the service was very shoddy We were not made welcome and were treated as though we were an inconvenience I wouldn t go bacck 
negative; After reading the reviews we were excited to visit the pub has been refurbished to a high standard and we couldn t decide what to have off the menu We eventually went for sandwiches the service was very good My partner picked his sandwich up and all of the bread was mouldy on the side We were offered other food but left massive disappointment as we liked the look of the menu and pub 
negative; Cramped and hot tables too close together Ordered a bottle of Prosecco which the waiter then proceeded to pour in to red wine glasses When I asked for the correct glasses he went and got white wine glasses Eventually we ended up with flutes  Deep fried goats cheese ordered as a starter we cut them open and both were stone cold in the middle so both sent back Unbelievably they delivered us back the same cut open dish that we had just returned and had put it in the microwave  We asked to speak to the manager at this point and while she was apologetic she did nothing  Main courses arrived and what a massive let down Pappardelle meat balls ragout and onion veloutÇù This was bland and slimy with undercooked and insipid meatballs There were only meatballs and they weren t much bigger than a marble If there was any veloutÇù on that dish it did a good job of hiding  The chicken escalope milanese style served with green salad was boring in the extreme The green salad is a few rocket leaves without any dressing and when I asked for some I was told there isn t any  And finally the one and only toilet wasn t very clean and the door is grimy and needs repainting  We would never return here there are so many better places to dine in this area 
negative; I went for lunch here with my boyfriend last weekend This was out third visit here First time for lunch We ordered a soup each to start I had the chicken with coconut milk and my boyfriend has king prawns in the non coconut broth Both soups were lovely Then we had chicken pad Thai and chicken massaman curry We waited minutes for our mains  there was other table in the restaurant The chicken was stone cold in fact it was as if it had come straight from the fridge But the sauce was hot The pad Thai was overcooked and sloppy We complained to the waiter as we were not happy to eat this We offered to pay for our soups and drinks and refused their offer of replacing the meals In the end we ended up paying for nothing We have had really nice meals here before and were so disappointed with this visit We will definitely not be returning for quite some time if at all 
negative; The manager is extremely rude to customers and either needs to take a course or rethink his choice of career felt very sorry for the other staff that have to work for him 
negative; My sister and I went on a walk yesterday from Colchester to Rowhedge our plan was to have lunch at The Anchor It was a really hot day and we weren t in any rush so we decided to have a drink first then order a meal later on However as soon as we entered the pub we were met by a very unwelcoming land lady She was rude and not very friendly We ordered two Lime Sodas then went to sit by the river As we are both smokers we went to go sit in the smoking area however there was a family with young children also sitting in the smoking area As the parents weren t smoking we didn t feel comfortable smoking around the child so we went to search for another table We found a small table with one chair on it and another chair propping up a sign facing the river My sister went to see if the chair really was propping up the sign as it was so close to the table it looked like a part of it She went to move it then realised the chair was in use for the sign so she went over and got a chair from another empty table and the abrupt land lady came out to tell her off I was in shock she said in a very loud voice THAT CHAIR IS THERE FOR A REASON  My sister then went on to explain that she knew that and she was going to get another chair Later on as we were just about to get up and find a menu a wasp flew into my sisters drink and unfortunately she is absolutely petrified of wasps and she stood up and asked if we could just leave she was flapping about everywhere the land lady came out and asked what the problem was again not in a very kind tone she then continued to make us feel as if we were being silly and told us to go find another table and stop flapping about I have never ever felt so unwelcomed it was as if she didn t want us to be there as if we didn t fit in because we were teenage girls i felt slightly discriminated against in the end we decided to just leave and take our money else where later on as we were leaving Rowhedge we saw two large very posh and expensive boats moor up beside The Anchor and the land lady seemed very happy and pleased to so them So i assume they are maybe more her kind of people We normally walk to Wivenhoe and have lunch at the rose and crown by the river so we will just stick to going there in the future Its a real shame because its such a lovely view by the river at The Anchor oh well 
negative; Booked for a Friday lunch with friend and was given a time of On arrival was told that window seating was only on offer if we vacated within an hour and a half We were taken to the second row seating that meant so we were going to be between the window seats and the third row seating  The alternative would have been the wall seating where one of us would have had to have our back to the view As we went to sit Staff appeared  Arrogant patronising manners very pushy two pieces of white bread put in front of us Coupled with this the noise level of crashing and banging made it very hard to have a conversation We both decided we had had enough and left  
negative; Utterly revolting attempt at Thai food Revolting sticky rice greasy massaman curry with tiny amount of chicken Swimming in oil I honestly thought the Thai fish cakes were something else I hadn t ordered they were rock hard and vile Arrives half an hour later than we were told Chicken in veg pad Thai Pad Thai really odd confused about what it was Honestly have had better supermarket ready meals Will not be going again My review gets one rating for delivery driver as he was very nice polite and smart 
negative; I came here with my boyfriend before a concert at the arena as it was the last place in the printworks that did not have an incredible wait I d walked past on various occasions however its always been empty and unwelcoming The warning signs were there We were also greeted by a stressed manager but we thought that was a given as the place must not be used to so many customers When we sat down we ordered some bread and dips while we waited which took a long time to arrive defeating the point When they came the bread was obviously not made on the premises The dips were nice but as stated by an earlier review that was the best bit My boyfriend ordered the ribs which looked delicious when we saw it on another table After a minute wait they arrived To our dissapointment they tasted like bitter tar and the Fat chips were more like whole potatoes deep fried Not a fan I had a pizza which was okay but fairly dry For the price of the place I d rather have gone to one of the various fast food places in the area Due to the fact we needed to get to the concert and the timing of the food meant we were already running late we didn t bother making a fuss but I definitely will not be returning  To end with a positive the one credit to the place was the friendliness of our waiter Its a shame the whole experience wasn t to the same standard 
negative; Went to the harvester for a meal with friends and was hugely disappointed from start to finish  Firstly a rude blonde lady showed us to our table after she looked and spoke to us like dirt  This person obviously thinks highly about herself which is not at all inviting to a customer  Anyway  when seated we wanted to order drinks but the blonde lady just walked away and stood at the end of the bar  We could hear all of the quot sexual and unpleasant quot comments being made by all of the staff which was shocking to say the least  We then over heard the blonde lady talk to another staff member in quite a patronising way about a drink I can imagine that this made the staff member feel quite embarrassed and under valued she walked away red faced I guess this blonde lady is a manager Instead of telling a staff member off about a drink maybe try telling your staff to not talk about disgusting sexual topics in front of guests instead of joining in with them I suggest proper training for the management team and some training in how to talk to staff and ways to praise them no wonder all of the staff looked miserable  While my friend was getting his salad from the very messy salad cart he said that a lady asked for more pasta and the so called quot chef quot  who was standing at the end of the bar talking to staff apparently grunted and said a swear word under his breath I m sorry harvester  is it too much trouble to ask your staff for more pasta To make things worse our drinks were not given to us but were sitting at the end of the bar for a long time staring at us  in the end my friend got them himself  Our meals were cold and we were forgotten about on many occasions by our waitress  Quite upset with the harvester  Rude staff and management  Uninviting salad cart with sauce all over the handles of the sauce spoons  Sorry harvester in Rayleigh but you have let us all down 
negative; Went here for mothers day and was just so disappointed We waited one and threequarters of an hour for our meal The owner was put out that we asked how long we would have to wait The poor waitress was so embarrassed In hindsight we should have walked out and gone elsewhere When our food arrived it was either wrong or like mine a very small portion Never again would i go there The restarant wasn t even full up so God knows what it would be like if it was We didn t dare order a sweet incase we had to wait until midnight DO NOT GO HERE  Unless you want to be treated with disregard by a horrible owner 
negative;Been to la cantina twice despite having heard that was not so good I really hate the food there but the most disturbing thing is the staff which in my opinion is pretentious rude unhelpful and most of all don t know what they are doing But please if you want to ruin your palate and your evening out do not hesitate i dont think there is worse place in bucks 
negative; Arrived at friendly welcome but service was slow to the point of being non existent We realised at that there was only one person serving at the bar and one waitress looking after all the tables We had our starters delivered at  and by  after prompting twice we still hadn t had our mains The only option was to leave or I fear we may still have been sitting there A great shame as it looked very promising 
negative; Terrible service food overrated bland British adaptation of what Italian is  Rude staff Terrible grungy decoy 
negative;  It had been a week since La Petite Bretagne opened in Clapham and we have been very keen to visit given the proximity and ease to get there from home This morning we came for the first time and unfortunately probably the last Interior looks great and very clean No menus on table Soon after we were seated and before placing our order one of the waiters tried to deliver another tables meal to us  It appeared that staff had trouble identifying table numbers or table system There were three waitstaff on shift and around six tables in use by small groups of  during our visit What I want to explain is that it was not overly busy during our visit We were presented with a menu a while after arriving and soon decided that we would try the savoury crepes We were not offered water or any other drinks while we waited another mins or so for the waiter to return to take our order Halfway through my order he apologised as he did not have a pen and would be back in a moment We then watched him clear the table next to us before going to find a pen to take our order We ordered our crepes and coffees only then being told the venue could not make our coffees as they had run out of milk When we clarified this he explained they had run out of milk and that sainsburys did not open until am being in Clapham and not a small village I am not sure why they had not thought to buy a couple of bottles of milk from any of the other shops that were open but perhaps that s just me Anyway we ordered an espresso and an Americano instead along with two savoury crepes On arrival of the coffees the waiter immediately said quot that s terrible quot pointing at my espresso and explained he would make another one I am not sure what was wrong with it as I didn t even get to see it but I m grateful as he did then come back with a great espresso albeit without a teaspoon to store in my sugar  Crepes were okay nothing extraordinary Thankfully the waitress noted that we had no cutlery and returned with it directly  I too had to go up to pay the bill and stood while three separate staff members including what appeared to be a manager walked straight past me standing with my money in hand and showed no acknowledgement I eventually had to ask to pay as another waitress was about to walk past me standing next to the cash register note in hand She rang it up gave me my five pence change and I asked for a receipt which I tore off myself after she stared at me blankly for asking The venue had an air of confusion nervousness and incompetence We suspect they have employed staff with no prior experience or gave not provided training Whilst we accept that stock control can sometimes be an issue there is never an occasion where milk is not easily obtained The fact that this had not been rectified shows a clear lack of management skill We are really disappointed because we genuinely wanted this to be good but now reading the other reviews it seems a systemic problem rather than teething problems  The owner responded to our complaint and offered a voucher for us to try them again Will update the review if and when this happens 
negative; On a beautiful sunny spring evening we walked along the Severn river and decided to have dinner at the Hawbridge Inn The food looked lovely on the plates of the guests in the garden when we arrived We ordered at  pm and our food didn t arrive until  pm We ordered burgers with fries  coleslaw  were okayish one had a burnt bread bun having been over toasted the other was completely dehydrated so fell apart when cut as it had been thawed in the microwave and then toasted according to the waitress After being taken away to be exchanged it didn t return for a further minutes and was replaced by a ciabatta The burgers were clearly of excellent quality but had been ruined as they had either been thawed in the microwave or cooked in one so we re dry and chewy The pub restaurant area was shabby and the toilets where disgustingly dirty with no loo roll no hand wash and only a cold hand blower Such a shame as the location of the pub is lovely There is a sign on the play area fence outside that reads something like no shouting running ball games food drinks basically don t have fun in the playground would not recommend 
negative;Due to a misunderstanding about venues and places we ended up in this Harvester instead of the one in Totton Initial impressions were well just like any other chain steak house  The staff were friendly and seated us quickly All went well until we went to the salad bar Every bowl was dirty and the salad was pretty uninspiring Most trays were empty and the ones that were half full had limp and dried out salad in them When we got the starters my husbands chicken skewers were raw They apologised and went and got more All the other starters were fine but the usual deep fried breaded variety Served in odd plastic baskets that were a bit difficult to eat from When the mains came there were a few near misses of meals nearly going into laps and the steak knife fell from one plate and landed in my hand point first Initial impressions of the main were poor The peas were looking tepid and stuck together and like they had been under a hot plate for a very long time No tomatoe and the chips were sunken and looked warmed through Very much like cardboard My mums oz steak was not cooked to her liking nor was the steak that came with the ribs Both went back When they returned they were inedible as full of sinu and gristle Mum couldn t even cut hers with a steak knife My oz rump was not a rump I know my cuts of meat and this looked nothing like a rump It was so tough I gave up trying to hack through it I had to spit several bits out as I could chew them no longer The mixed grill was dried out and only the chicken and gammon were worth trying to eat The Manager did come to talk to us and was very sorry and generously offered free desserts but we declined She then took a large amount off the bill that were were happy with but even with this gesture there is nothing worse than having to pay for something you can t eat and everyone was very disappointed We won t be going back 
negative; Terrible experience over the morning coffee that was disgusting anyway  when the boss approached the pregnant lady and asked her to leave because she ordered a drink only Extremely inhospitable rude and unprofessional owner who is an incarnation of the cafe s logo Hygiene of the cafe is not on the top though 
negative; Went for lunch with family  adults and children We had a wheelchair and was put in a corner booth which was crapped for people especially with a wheelchair Staff seemed very disinterested in helping us the food was okay The children did not enjoy it at all we ordered Christmas dinners when we arrived we were assured it wouldn t be anything too fancy for the children who can be a little fussy but when it came their chicken was coated in pepper My eldest niece picked at hers and we sent the youngest meal back and changed it for sausage and mash which was no better it had some herb in it and the skin was very tough chewy the mash had something added to it also possibly mustard  no good for an year old so she didn t eat that either so we left and ended up feeding them in Greggs at this point they were very hungry Would never go with Children again they do not cater for children at all In terms of the adults meals they were average very disappointing considering the price tag 
negative; Greeted by unwelcoming Lenka who was very rude especially when it came to my month old daughter Have been here may times before but will never return or recommend after such sour faced waitresses who seem like they are doing you a big favour by talking to you very disappointed after the many happy times I have spent there with my family and friends WILL NOT RETURN GET RID OF YOUR STAFF 
negative;Went here once and won t go back again We waited for ages for a table waited ages for someone to take our order and waited ages for cold food The food positions were small the garlic bread didn t taste of garlic Staff seemed not to care and were more interested in talking amongst themselves
negative;We waited minutes and when food arrived my husband received a mushroom risotto when he ordered a seafood risotto we decided to leave and the manager was very rude and said he would not speak to my husband as he had been drinking My husband had driven my daughter to the theatre and then met me he had been at work all day and not been drinking just looked tired The manager kept saying it takes a long time to cook a mushroom risotto which is fine but at the end of the day my husband ordered a seafood risotto We have previously eaten lots here but this has put us off eating here again 
negative;I hadn t been here for quite a while and I won t be going back again When they took our order they said quot sorry we haven t got any chicken Half of the menu has chicken in it Had a steak instead and it was not good very tasteless 
negative; Upon entrance we had to wait over minutes until a waitress asked us if we needed anything baring in mind the restaurant was not busy at all  Another significant period of time passed as we waited for our drinks Although the food was above average the service was absolutely shocking We never received a check back on our food and after we had finished and wanted to leave there was not one member of staff on the floor to ask we could have easily have left without paying and even when staff did reappear no one seemed interested in paying attention to any of the customers 
negative;  Visited here yesterday for the first time and certainly won t be returning Disorganised dirty tables dirty floors walls are dirty and in need of decoration The cutlery was dirty and most of the teaspoons were tea stained Food average Very disappointing 
negative; After looking at this restaurant on Trip Advisor and it appearing th best restaurant in Shanklin we decided to pop in for dinner We were greeted by a friendly waitress and decided on starters of garlic bread and squid this consisted of three breadcrumbed rings of squid with mayo and salad this was quite nice if a little sparse for the price however the mains were a different story all together chicken in brandy and cream was not chicken breast as expected but a drumstick and thigh which was stringy and tough and the sauce had no flavour a chicken bacon and mushroom pasta in a marsala sauce was also ordered which was tasteless and very mediocre to say the least but to be fair the waitress did explain that the sauce was not thickened in any way The bill came to over our verdict if you like good Italian food give this a miss even Dick Turpin wore a mask when he robbed people  
negative; The restaurant had been done up so thought I d give it a look  Arrived at : and was told a min wait Waited hour Once seated we then waiting longer and longer to be served and then longer for the food to arrive It was absolutely ridiculous  The food wasn t too bad but the wait was a joke  
negative; Totally rude rude rude rude rude staff and managers filthy place never ever again place needs a good clean how long can it last like this is the question surely not long not atall happy how can you run a place like this  
negative; We came here during Sunday lunchtime and was completely ignored for minutes before we were seated at a table that was available all along Service was terrible and the food was not authentic at all The dumplings had really thick skin and were so overcooked that they were falling apart The noodles were not good either The milk tea was very watered down and tasted nothing like the authentic kind Very crowded environment too  As a Chinese person I would not recommend this place at all 
negative; Went for a meal on my anniversary got to say it was the worst thing i have ever eaten to the point that im reporting them to envirmental health tomorrow cold inedible and i know its gonna be seen again by tomorrow i didnt even eat half of the nasty crap on my plate if i had had a possibility of leaving minus stars i would  Unless you wan to loose weight quickly avoid like the plague Too hot in the resturant funny as the food was cold Felt like it had been there since a previous meal time  
negative; We went here when our first choice was fully booked Staff were friendly and the starters were good but unfortunately it all went downhill from there My partner ordered a Florentina pizza When it arrived the egg in the centre was completely raw He sent it back and ordered a different pizza His sister ordered salmon in lime butter  it was undercooked an slimy and had to be sent back In fairness they did make her pasta with pomodoro sauce which wasn t on the menu I ordered a calzone pizza When it arrived the cheese in the centre was not melted and the fillings were cold I sent it back and they made me a new one The second one was no better After the waitress had put her finger in the pizza to see how cold it was the pizza was taken away Unfortunately when it came back only some more cheese had been put on the top of the same pizza and it had been put back in the oven And it was still cold in the middle By this time my partner and his sister had finished their meals so I ate round the edges and left most of it All in all the evening was rather a farce and whilst memorable for all th wrong reasons I won t be returning They did knock the price of the calzone off the bill and sent us home with a bottle of beer and I am sure it was a problem with the oven rather than the chef but it was not a great gastronimical experience 
negative;Went in for food last night but the state of the restaurant was discusting Dirty plates on loads of tables and looks gross Wouldn t go their again I normally eat their every weekend 
negative; Ordered fish and chips Assured it was COD Priced at thought this has got to be good Was I wrong Frozen steak cut chips deep fried The piece of fish was grey in colour and tough Have had a more tender steak than that piece of fish It s what you would expect from frozen pollock And the grease from the fish batter soaked the chips and peas which in turn made them inedible Never again They credited us for one meal but still believe we had been conned Very disappointed 
negative; I have been coming here since last visit June bad service we had booked in advanced still had to wait hour mature woman who served us was very rude and stuck up will not be going again unless change of management 
negative; I would like to say I enjoyed the food here but I didn t it was terrible firstly quid for main not over the top if it is decent but this reminded me of a school dinner Which I have not had the miss pleasure of eating for about years so to automatically remind me of this horror of yestayear tells you something Roast potatoes from a fryer hard in the middle the menu advertised lamb but the waitress said they only had beef or chicken should of gone with the chicken as the beef was thinly presliced Well to be fair any thicker and you could possibly become Upminsters no shoe maker the waitress was a nice person and when we finished came over to ask if we had enjoyed the so called meal No we did not explained why It was terrible she to her credit quot I will try and do something with your bill quot what are you a miracle worker can you turn a bill into a chef quot just half decent food would be a bonus quot 
negative; We have visited this pub last year and had a good experience so decided to go back in march this year What an awful experience We had booked in advance for sunday lunch for of us at pm It took them an hour and a half to serve our food There were clearly not enough staff to deal with a busy sunday lunch There was only one person serving drinks from the bar so consequently it took half an hour to get our drinks The food was ok though my husband ordered gourmet chips and just got ordinary chips on his plate The staff took his plate away and it was a further minutes before it came back by which time the rest of us had nearly finished eating our meals To cap it off we had the instrusion of a workman repairing a fire exit right next to our table The fire exit door was open and blowing a draft across our table In fairness to the waiting staff they worked hard and were trying to do the job as well as they could but there were obviously not enough of them i did write to Vintage Inns to let them know of our disappointment but just received a generic apology email Sorry Vintage Inns I am not impressed and we will not be returning 
negative; A miserable abrupt rude waitress that didn t really want customers in her place this cannot be classed as a restaurant  London is expensive but pounds for a can of coke is a COMPLETE RIP OFF AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROXIMITY TO THE QUEEN S RESIDENCE  I was horrified to find that cans of drink  burger and chips all of chips and measly piece of dry chocolate fudge was more than pounds which included the % service charge  no service at all  but was not in the mood for an argument the already rude server  This is an embarrassment to the whole of Britain as I am sure many a tourist nip in for a quick meal or drink to be totally ripped off DO NOT ENTER THIS ESTABLISHMENT  I was tempted to stand outside and stop people from walking in here pounds for a ml of water when it was only  in the palace This place makes me so angry  this place needs to be shut down I didn t see any happy customers in this cafe 
negative;My visit today with my husband was a very poor experience in customer service He politely requested a sandwich with local bacon and asked if he could also have an egg in the sandwich The waitress asked the chef who said no and also no to sausage All items were on the menu but even though the menu offers you a sandwich that you could tailor  clearly you couldn t A note on the soup  I love sweet potato soup but not today s special which appeared to have most of the black pepper pot added prior to serving A modern cafe offering an eclectic menu could really be a bit more flexible with it s own menu 
negative; Food wait was un real Minuit wait for starters then a further minits for mains the waitress was running round like a headless chicken barking orders she had a very unprofessional appearance  was canoodling a fellow collegue Not what I want to see on my evening off Was happy to see there was no service charge as microwaved food and plates been thrown on tables is far from service really great location really poor pub only good comment I have is I met a famous comedian that day and the young lady on the bar was very polite and quick on serving those waiting although explaining she was new to this pub but clearly not new to bar service she had been left alone on the bar whilist the other were on there phones or canoodling shame this pub used to too notch won t be back a while hopefully new management chefs will be occurring 
negative; We booked Christmas lunch for  p m and arrived in good time  There was no one manning the bar so we had to wait to be served  Out table wasn t ready eventually sat down three quarters of an hour late but starter wasn t served for another half an hour   The main meal was also delayed  We had  children with us they were extremely well behaved considering they were very hungry  We received no apologies for the tardiness of the service  In the opinion of all the adults in the party the restaurant had over booked  there was not enough staff to cater for the number of parties who had booked  The only positive was the good selection of vegetables  Would we go again most definitely not  
negative; Arriving  mins after lunch had apparently ended at  pm during last week whilst on holiday  We were offered a seat at the bar as there were no tables available    even when there were several empty tables and lunch was essentially over    Crab starter each at a cool   a head   must have lasted all of  mouthfulls  Sorry not what I call special 
negative; Have been eating here for a number of years  Today we were shown our table placed our order and was then left to find our own cutlery   The table in front of us was left uncleared for  minutes no white bread rolls another diner told us she had been waiting ages for them  The food was ok but looked very unappetising on the plate  We asked a passing waitress for the bill but felt sorry we had to interrupt her on her mobile phone  staff in groups chatting and manager walking around doing nothing   I felt as though I was eating in a cafe this place has gone right down hill such a shame 
negative; Their pathetic excuse for portion size was feeble  the waiting time was unacceptable and the missing food was just the final straw   My dinner was served with less than  chips  perhaps this is why they now ask if you d like to purchase extra chips for    What a terrible experience  
negative; We are regular customers of this pub for years as we love the service and the food  It is also convenient for us as we live nearby    We don t usually have problems with food and services and never complain with anything but tonight was the worst visit ever  The new manager doesn t know how to handle customer complaints at all  He is not friendly and  no experience in customer services  We don t want to expand the story as we are still fuming with anger  All we know is that we will not visit this pub again  They lost us as their valued customers  
negative; A group of us had lunch at this pub restaurant and were bitterly disappointed and thoroughly disgruntled  not only by the quality of the food   which was very poor   but by the prices which are exorbitant for a pint of lemonade   Outrageous  Can hardly believe they have the sheer audacity  I explained that  as a Coeliac sufferer  I could not eat normal bread  they could not offer Gluten free  but asked if I could have the Crab Salad Baguette without the Baguette and perhaps a bit more salad  The Menu price  Expensive but the menu offered little variety for Coeliacs  The salad arrived  a cheap tin of thoroughly mashed crab meat in far too much mayonnaise on a bed of limp lettuce and a chopped onion  When I went to pay  I was asked for I queried this discrepancy and was informed that they had had to make it SPECIALLY   because I had asked not to be given bread  You couldn t MAKE it up  I paid up without complaint  so as not to embarrass my group but I was disgusted and will never visit this pub again  I shall also ensure that I spread the word about their appalling customer service  By all means have a pint here  but don t EAT  if you value your wallet  
negative; Go somewhere else  I beg of you  No wine list provided  no menus provided   had to ask for them after being there nearly half an hour  specials board irrelevant  take it down    RAN OUT of burgers  surely you expect to sell quite a few of these on a Friday night  perhaps restock the freezer in preparation waited almost an hour and a half for our meals  some meals served cold and or over cooked  waitress just about managed an apology but was then heard complaining about us to another table  When we left  I tried to make a complaint  but the member of staff simply smiled inanely at me  saying nothing  Appalling   Thank goodness for fantastic company to get us through the experience  Never  ever again  
negative; Went for a meal for a change in a Sunday  The meal was nothing special  Just Sunday roasts   The service was basic The food was basic The wine and beers were good   The deserts were very good  
negative; My friends and I have been going to Hai Ha on and off for years  I went  weeks ago after about a years break and will never go back there again  The service was abrupt and slow despite it being quiet but the worse thing was that AFTER EATING   OF MY VEGETARIAN SINGAPORE NOODLES I FOUND  PIECES OF CHICKEN   when i spoke to the waitress about it  she initially tried to say it wasn t really chicken  then said it wasn t really in the dish  despite all of us looking at the  pieces of chicken on my plate  and then spoke to the cook who apparently said there couldn t be too much chicken in my dish as it was probably chicken left in the wok from the previous dish  As if this made it ok    i have been vegetarian for  years and tried to explain to the waitress that it didn t matter if it was  piece of meat it wasn t alright  she just kept saying  it wasn t much chicken STAY AWAY for HAI HA 
negative;Location great but this place really let s it down  Had a soggy pork roll full of gravy  with a basic salad and shop bought coleslaw  I ate the meat only because I was very hungry  Shall NOT re visit  Don t bother
negative; This has to be the worst evening meal we have ever had  the food was appalling  everything deep fried and burnt  The waitress was just as bad  not knowing the soup of the day or the curry and made no attempt to find out  They had run out of mussels but were still serving the sea food dishes without them and charging full price  Run out of avocado and was using salsa instead which isn t even similar  Four of us dined and every started and every main course was just awful  did not stay for dessert  
negative; It s a shame as the restaurant has been refurbished  so it should be a great little stop off  but unfortunately the experience was bad  I m writing this sitting after eating  and out of the  unoccupied tables surrounding me only one does not have dirty plates on it  and there is also food and a fork on the floor near us  There are customers wandering trying to find a clean table  rather than simply an unoccupied one   The new menu looks good though  I m vegan and ordered from the create your own breakfast options  beans  grilled tomatoes  chopped plum tomatoes  hash browns  fried bread and a side of toast  great in principle but it arrived with the once crispy bread and hash browns swimming in tomato juice slop :   I addition the whole plate of food was like warm  and I had to send my toast back as they d buttered it  despite me specifying no butter both upon ordering and upon payment  The main issue seems to just understaffing  it was disorganised chaos and it wasn t even very busy  
negative; What a horrible experience  I have visited this place with my collegue for quick lunch  I must admit it was very busy day but waiting for burgers for  minutes was just too much  plus they were overcooked  The manager didn t seem to know what is going on  instead of dealing with the situation directly  she kept shouting at staff and then sent them over with complimentary bottle of wine  which we weren t interested in  Very unprofessional and unorganised management  what an embarassement to this place  I will not be comming back  
negative; My colleagues and I have been regulars at this venue  However  we were very disappointed by the rudeness of one of the owners this evening  to the extent that we don t intend to come here again  I m not sure what has changed at the venue recently but there is an unpleasant atmosphere and the attitude from the owners is that good customer service isn t necessary  since they believe they can get enough customers regardless of how customers are treated   I don t often have such wholly negative reviews of places but I strongly believe that there is a duty to show at least good manners to customers  if not appreciation  and standards have fallen well below the mark here and would consequently not recommend this place if you would like a relaxed  enjoyable evening  
negative; Took  and a half hours to actually have a main    not all of what we order came out   Charged for things that we didn t have    drinks that was paid separate  But put on the bill  Wouldn t recommend this place to anyone   
negative; We visited here with friends family for lunch on a Sunday but found they only did Sunday roast which wasn t really what we were looking for but decided to stay  Very disappointed in the lunch   it was expensive for what it was  Not much meat  lots of vegetables and totally covered in thick gravy which for people like myself and my husband this spoilt our lunch  We do not like loads of gravy   Should be served separate and when we said this to them after the meal we were told that they would do this in the future when the gravy boats arrived    It wasn t that busy and the service was not the best either even though there were plenty of staff around  
negative;Really poor food  even when we sent our two main courses back and had replacements  the maitre d was still making excuses for yellow decomposing watercress  saying the chef had the right to expect salad from a salad bag to be fresh  Our food looked like it had been revived in a grill or microwave even though both dishes were both specials of the day off the hand written menu 
negative; I ve been a couple of times   found the food ok but not very warm  This meal was a carvary  I suppose the meal would have been warmer if they d had warmed the plates fully  Never been back since  
negative;My starter was absolutley vile but nobody asked so at the end of the meal it was sat there cold   the manager had an attitude  very rude arigante 
negative; I find it hard to believe that people actually over this restaurant as good as we found it terrible  We were the only two people in and still had to wait  minutes for our starter which was a very disappointing slice of bread with something spread on it  The price for this was around We spent most of the evening waiting for food which was not very nice   Seriously if it wasn t for this restaurant putting vouchers on groupon it would have close down a long time ago   All the food was terrible and service very slow 
negative; Terrible customer service awful lack of quality food inedible starter   sent back mains as cold   tough steak 
negative; Went to mill pond with children as rushing and thought would be a treat  They always seem to get my order wrong  Lack off understanding on microphone  
negative; Having visited Miller and Carter on the th of May unfortunately we were unable to get a table we were told by couples leaving Miller and Carter if you haven t booked a table you will be unable to get one we check this out and this was so true we were advised that booking was essential as it was so popular at this time we did so and but the following week on arrival we stayed in the car as we got there a little bit earlier to our dismay we seeing the front line staff smoking outside the premises at the front of the building which put us of as we are both non smokers when we arrived inside the building we were greeted by a very friendly member of staff we showed us to our table unfortunately the table was in the top corner of the room with the radiator on full and the chair that was so uncomfortable we were at the end of a row of tables  with a family celebrating a th with there family and children but we went out for a nice quiet meal for two we asked them to be moved which the staff did obliged and give us a better table the starter came out which was a platter for two it was average we waited a while for our main meal  on ordering our main meal we were advised that fillet steak if you want it well done it wouldn t be too good the waitress recommended ribeye which i went for   When the food came out it did look nice but I thought it was a little bit pricey for what we got   and that was for both sharing a starter and main meal and two drinks  will not be a rush to return the refit looks lovely shame we could rate our evening better  This is our opinion on our evening of the @: Mr   Mrs Holroyd 
negative;Took the family out for a celebration meal  The first thing that was apparent was that the tables are too small  The service was very poor with the waiter forgetting the drinks order twice  The food was very poor pre cooked duck in my own case and re heated aubergine dishes  The servings were very poor for an inflated price  Chipped dishes used and blunt cutlery  We only complained to staff about the service as we did not want to embarrass our family  The recompense offered were   vouchers up to the th January which had been given to every customer in the restaurant  I would not dream of going to this restaurant again  Very Very disappointing 
negative; I visited this restaurant this evening  Mixed meze served with burnt bread followed by over cooked pasta with a greasy diluted Neapolitan sauce  No BBQ in sight for our fish main course  Salmon over cooked and sea bass served in greasy breadcrumbs  Food was awful and felt terrible feeding my children this dinner  Staff were poor and management didn t care   Don t waste your money here  
negative; Ate here before and the food and service exceptional  went back for Sunday lunch and could have been in a different place   Plates cold  meat grossly overcooked vegetables equally overcooked and the Gravy dont even go there Tried to complain but noone was interested   We wont be going back  
negative; Sorry to say that we found the Diing Tay very disappointing  We weren t hugely hungry so had a takeaway of chow mein and singapore noodles and it was bland bland bland  Probably the worst Chinese food we have ever had  
negative; Disappointed again  wanted to give it another chance  the food tasted microwaved as in re  heated to me  we were offered one type of bread which was stale  had to ask for butter  service was poor considering the restaurant was virtually empty  i was without cutlery for my main and no side dish for our side orders  really basic hospitality skills and catering lacking  what a shame  
negative; Went here today after reading the reviews and having longed for a decent place near by  To say I was disappointed is a bit of an understatement  The menu was overpriced the chef full of his own self importance to the point of being rude and the area dirty and cramped  I ve eaten in a range of places all over the world and have to say the food did not live up to the hype and the terrible rudeness made this a place to avoid in my experience  
negative; We pre booked a private area from pm to am for  guests for my daughter s st Birthday Party for which we guaranteed a   minimum spend  which we had to pay upfront  On the night  the Manager just took it upon himself to shut the venue  hours early  at  midnight  with no prior notice or warning  My daughter showed the Manager a copy of the booking form  which confirmed the closing time as am but he just commented that he hadn t seen one before and rudely insisted that they all leave   FLORIDITA COMPLETELY RUINED MY DAUGHTER S ST BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION   THEY HAD THEIR MONEY AND THAT WAS ALL THEY SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT  
negative; Visited Saturday night  first impressions staff were so miserable  no customer service  no smiles  Tables very close together practically sat on the couples knee next to us  The food was awful  My curry was cold I sent it back received another which was nearly burnt  No taste to curry at all  Rice was bland chips poor and naan bread was tiny and also cold  Waiter cleared table of dirty dishes but removed tablecloth whilst we were still finishing off  They were so miserable the staff didn t want to be there found the atmosphere very uncomfortable  Definitely do not recommend  
negative; We visited as a family for a special lunch on a very warm day  The lady at the bar was pleasant but as soon as we got outside to look for a seat in the shade the owner  so we were told which  as business owners ourselves  we found hard to believe  got really rude when our daughter sat down to drink a drink quickly before going off to play  Bearing in mind that it was  degrees and it was the only shady area albeit designated for  adults only   he had no patience and was aggressive in front of our daughter  Hardly what you expect from a pub restaurant owner  Certainly not a pleasant environment for families or the friendly and warm welcome they advertise on their site  We wanted to order lunch but left and went elsewhere  No wonder the place was almost empty on a lovely  summer s day    
negative;I m not a fussy eater atall but the food from here was disgusting   If you like very bland food with hardly any flavour and no hint of any Chinese spices then this is your place  We ordered chowmein and curry  The pork chowmein was cold and bland was just like oily noodles and the beef curry came full of meat but the sauce tasted like extremely watered down gravy  it was inedible  Even after trying to add salt to try and give it some flavour  ended up in the bin 
negative; Tried chicken sauces pants didn t enjoy any of it over priced food I could of made it better at home took my bf and father we were not impressed staff were nice though 
negative; Visited on   waited half an hour to be seated and a fighter two hours for our meal  Service was a joke ordered drinks never came will never be returning the food is also shocking not what is said on menu   If you want a good meal don t come here  Half the menu is full off deep fried frozen reheated food   
negative; I had dinner in this restaurant  I m italian and there wasn t any italian food here  The Antipasto included Parma ham  salami  mozzarella and melon with avocado  olives  and tomatoes  There wasn t Parma ham  but it was another kind of less quality ham   Italian Speck   We ordered a Margherita with bufala mozzarella pizza  but in the pizza there wasn t bufala mozzarella  The beer called Peroni red  it wasn t a red beer  but it was the normal Peroni  As an italian I can say: Never more  
negative; Beautiful food but waiting two hours and being told the driver had left at   and still no delivery  minutes later and still waiting  If you fancy an Indian for dinner I suggest you order pretty early  Very disappointed 
negative;Visited Chez la vie on Saturday  March   having just read other reviews I have to totally agree with them  The menu was disappointing compared to the previous two visits  my partner has been visiting this restaurant for over  years so he was even more dismayed than I  We had the smoked salmon  feta cheese and avocado starter there were  x   s of cherry tomato  a few shavings and I mean shavings of smoked salmon and a thimble full of avocado  We both opted for seafood pancake for our main course   this came in an ovenproof terrine with the pancake as a kind of crust  It was not what we expected   At the time we made noises of enjoyment to not spoil our evening as we had been so looking forward to visiting again  joking that we would make a pact not have the venison again which we usually succumb to  However  we began discussing  taking indigestion remedies as we spoke and by Sunday morning vowed never to go there again and how poor overall the meal had been The drinks were expensive and my wine although measured out was just about covering the bottom of the glass  Oh dear Chez la vie I think you need to address a potential disaster if not closure looming in the future unless you get back to your former glory 
negative; We popped in during our lunch break and ordered prawn baguettes  To our annoyance we waited  minutes before we were presented with a very washed out looking tasteless prawn baguette and a few cheap crisps  Why this took so long to prepare when we were the only two people that ordered food is quite beyond me  needless to say we will not return as life is too short  
negative; Starter pate  Butter ice refrigerated  Chunky  Branston with something added   Gammon  egg  chips  pineapple  peas  Peas tasteless  Gammon served with rind on  amazing is this a chef    and was tough   Mustard tomatoe sauce was decanted from large bottles in the fridge to small sauces all in the middle of the restaurant   Coffee  Watery and only just a bit warm   Half the main course left but head waitress said not a thing   Most disappointing  Only restaurant attached to the Premier Inn  not part or attached to Premier Inn   Premier Inn s Brewers Fayre   good standard  Ship Inn   poor  Laurie 
negative; I have only had a takeaway from here once  never again  The whole place is filthy  the staff are unhelpful and disinterested  I had missing items from my order  luckily I checked before I left  I got a very surly response to my complaint from what looked like the manager  I will never go here again  
negative; The barmaid was beautifully pleasant and helpful so we felt we were onto a winner    We ordered some food and our initial thoughts were completely fashed  my husband ordered the fishcakes and I ordered the open king prawn sandwich  The fishcakes had probably been cooked a few times as they were dark brown in colour instead of a nice crisp golden hue  they rested on a soggy bed of rocket which has been soaked in dressing  My sandwich was a slice of brown bread  unbuttered  with a lettuce leaf on top and five six small prawns on top of that  no dressing  I thought open sandwiches  especially prawn  would at least have had a marie rose sauce and some lemon  we had a side order of chips which were also overcooked  This food was so awful we left without eating it  The worst pub food I have ever been served in my life  Definitely wouldn t recommend  
negative; My husband had a kebab delivered we only live minutes away  It was stone cold had to reheat it in the microwave He then had hot lettuce  YUK 
negative;My friend is diabetic and asked to use the disabled toilet to take insulin  the bouncers refused and when he rightly questioned this was told he had to leave  This is absolutely disgusting  It completely ruined our night and we all left  Thankfully nothing awful happened but in this day and age  bars need to be more accommodating and educated 
negative; we booked on line the night before for a Sunday carvery  received no email response back from fissions so presumed all was ok  Arrived at gissons and advised management that we had booked online  We were than informed that they were too busy to check the computer every five minutes for bookings  Why than over the option   The manager than decided to do a rant and rave in front of us to all staff there which was very unprofesional and made us THE PAYING CUSTOMER uncomfortable  Embarrassed to what th do next either stay or leave we decided to stay but cut our visit short due to stressful atmosphere created by the manager  Would not recommend it to any of our friends or family  wanted a nice Sunday carvery we received the worse customer service   
negative; have been waiting an hour and half  not for the first time to realise my meal is not even on the way or registered with the online service  not that it makes a difference with the telephone service as they don t seem to give a crap after I told them I would order elsewhere and put the phone down on me  have been a loyal customer for years at different address s  the food is good but service is rubbish  I wont be using again  
negative; I was very disappointed when visiting goodies  following reading good reviews   The fish was undercooked and the chips were just awful  it left me and my partner ill for days after   Would not recommend or visit again and will definitely not let my family go there when they visit me   Avoid this place  
negative; really bad service  two waiters saw us come in  waiting to be served but they just continued to do their own thing  we actually had to go up to them and asked to be seated  how ridiculous    food wasnt all that either  bad atmosphere overall  staffs were miserable  never coming here again  
negative; Despite booking more than a month in advance  we were kept waiting for our table for in excess of half an hour after our reservation time  The food selection was substantially reduced in comparison to our previous visits and the quality of the offer was not of the standard that you would expect from a hotel of The Groves standing  Main courses and deserts were particularly disappointing  I have no problem paying  star prices  but in return I expect  star quality food as well as service The Grove fell significantly short of providing the standards that one could reasonably expect from such an establishment  They appear to expect to charge premium prices for what is a below average product  Value for money  most certainly not  I go to quality restaurants to eat good food  not to admire the location or the decor  
negative; Words cannot describe how bad this place is   We went on a sunday eve  place was not busy  this should have been a sign   Waiting staff stood around laughing and chatting not interested in the customers which were there  Had  different waiters throughout the meal  each as apathetic as the last  We started with the bread which was stale and the crusts inedible  No knife to spread the butter either  For main we had the goats cheese salad which consisted of huge chunks of tomato and beetroot  small bits of cheese and croutons  No dressing and so bland and tasteless and no actual salad leaves this is not a salad   Also we ordered a burger which was below average  Spicy potatoe wedges were also bland  no spice whatsoever  We also had to ask for cutlery as none were given to us or laid out on the table before arrival    For dessert we shared the chocolate brownie sundae hoping it would somehow save the meal  How wrong could be be  The sundae had no chocolate and was basicially vanilla ice cream with toffee sauce accompanied by  jam dougnuts    again these were anything but dougnuts but hard tasteless balls of nothing covered in jam    Total bill nearly came to nearly  quid which included a tip  Very obvious why they do this when the food and service is so bad  They don t even tell you its added on either  I would never dream of eating here again    Lastly to anyone reading tripadvisor thinking of having a bumpkin tonight  may i suggest going  metres across the road to Jamies Italian  
negative; Went in after booking a table but was told the table was not ready for us  then when it was   went upstairs to a nearly empty eating area   so am unsure what the wait was for  Ordered the baked camembert and the scallops to start  Camembert was fine but carrots had been cut up about two weeks ago as were so dry and old  The seared scallops were cold so were sent back  but when they came up were as stone cold as they were when sent away plus missing one that was cut into  Offered a free round of drinks as compensation but we were already feeling uneasy at the thought of what offering was going to arrive next and we were right to be  The handmade burger was over cooked and rock hard  the Prawn Thai Curry came as a CHICKEN Thai Curry which we were not notified about plus it was swimming in oil  the ravioli was average and the seafood salad  well seeing as we could see the sea from the seat we weren t sure how they managed to get such OLD fish  The mackerel you could knock someone out with it was that dry and hard  The waitress did apologise and said nothing like this had happened before but this was hard to believe  They did waiver some of the dishes but the amount we paid we were unsure of how they came to this because none of the dishes or drinks added up to it    Does not represent the town at all   embarrassing for Portscatho s high standards  Avoid Avoid Avoid  
negative; As today being sunday the th of May    Me my friend and our  children customed at The Marsden Inn  As we have been a few times knowing the children are welcome although this is the first time i have ever met the new management   Both children are well behaved and used to eating out but the attitude from the  Manager  was appauling  We sat in the back where pool table is and knowing we had children so away from customers round the corner as my daughter was singing her favourite Frozen song let it go in which the band for the night kindly heard as she sang for them  They where so impressed and taking in with her they then gave her a free CD which we thought was extremely kind and never thought for one second my daughter was in the managers words  running riot  which he stated as he stood with members of the band so that we were in ear shot   how professional  all my little girl was doing was standing at the very back next to fireplace away from customers in her only little world singing  We had been there for  hours for my friends son to watch the match which my daughter never once ran riot  which in my eyes is a child running all over the place not just stood in one place at the back singing round the corner where no one but us could hear  and i was in total control of her I as an OFSTED Registered childminder think the title of family friendly should be removed   
negative; Quite possibly the worst dining experience we have ever had  Went for my dad s th Birthday  they knew it was a special occasion  had table booked for  pm on Saturday th Feb but starters didn t arrive until  pm  Waitress opened the wrong wine  none of our desired starters were available  then we were told two of our desired mains weren t available  Having re ordered mains  we awaited further minutes then were told one of the alternative mains we choose was not available anymore  despite seeing a neighbour table eat it   We were only a party of    main meals came at once  then we waited so long for the other  that the first three were stone cold    The best part of the nigh was leaving  Sorry for such a negative review  but I would not recommenced Gascoyne Place to anyone I m afraid  
negative; I do not normally review places like this but felt I had to share what is honestly the worst meal anywhere I have ever eaten   Let s start with the only single good thing depending on how you look at it as quite simply there is no option for no stars   The childrens meal sizes are bigger than some but for    they should be that is the only positive I could find   The homemade steak pie is quite simply abisomal never have I been given something as dry as this  not talking lack of gravy I could have been given buckets of the stuff and it simply would not have changed this in anyway  The steak if you can call it that looks like it had been left outside all day on the hottest day of the year and had dried out so dried out it had changed appearance and colour   Hubby s and the kids fish and chips did not fair much better   Staff extremely misrable  place not exactly looking that clean either  Needless to say a lot of the food was left uneaten   Highchair that was used for daughter was again quite simply the grottyiest I have ever seen with years and years of caked on foodstuffs in the strap and a tray that doesn t stay on    We visit Great Yarmouth twice a year but will never venture into here again   Again I must say there should be an option for zero stars 
negative; We visited this restaurant last night as a party of   Our booking was at  o clock  We waited half an hour and then we were told there was a long table available  but if we waited  minutes there was a round table being cleared  After  minutes we were told that the round table had not left yet  but the long table was ready  We decided to take this  We then waited an hour before anyone came to take our order  One waiter took out starter order  and  minutes later another came over to take our main course  This was in a very military fashion  quot you go  main dish quot   quot ok now rice and naans quot   Considering we booked out table for   I think it is absolutely disgraceful that we did not get out starters until    We had to chase both our courses  and ask for drinks numerous times  When our main courses were finally brought up  we then had to ask for cutlery  One member of our party was given a childs knife and fork twice  being told that you had no more as it was the end of the night  Another ended up with half his rice in his lap where the waiting staff were rushing as it was nearing closing time  My partner decided to invite our friends to this restaurant as we have recently moved to the area  and had heard good things about it  The service was shocking  and the food was no better than we have had elsewhere  We will not be going back  You couldn t make up what an awful evening we had  awful apart from the company  one of our friends said it was like a Benny Hill sketch  but not amusing  
negative; it took mins to seat the two of us in a fairly empty Orchid Lounge and then had to ask twice to be served at the table  The staff were polite apologetic but panicked for some reason while waiting we heard diners complaining about the food  We tried to order drinks and food at the same time   but the waitress walked of  times to attend to other diners whilst taking our order  We asked for an update on our food after  mins   they said the fish was taking long the rest of the food was ready and proposed they bring what s ready  The rice and noodles arrived but the curry did not  Another  mins the rest of the food arrived  The food was terrible The rice was dry and stale    the top was hard and dry    which they replaced The veg noodles were again stale and congealed together like a lump  The green Thai curry had a very sweet thick consistency   we sent it back  It ruined our night  Very disappointing service and food  
negative; First time in this place  ordered one adult cheese burger which arrived cold  One child cheese burger with  pieces of meat in a small bun and no cheese plus cold  Sent back  Replacement was so bad that we could not eat it  The fries were OK  
negative; Had been wanting to try this place for ages  Friendly waitress  Drinks limited  we couldnt get a nice cornish beer as its not included on the menu  The food was very disappointing  We had the set meal  everything served was below standard and not what I would expect of a mexican restaurant  Everything appeared and tasted like it was out of a packet or jars  Very expensive for what you get  Was not impressed  Would not visit again  
negative;Booked  weeks in advance for a family meal of  people  Special requested for a big table so we can all sit together been told have to be upstairs which we agreed  Arrived no table been set  ended up  tables  no tea cups  no chopstick  no napkins  No menu for  mins  We should have leave then but we pre ordered special dishes with babies and  adults we won t be able to get dinner at that time of night  First dish arrived but they have no rice  no bowl  dish or chopstick to go with it  asked whereabouts is our rice been told by the waiter  quot  how should I know I don t cook the rice  quot   The fish we specially order is so overpriced and one of the specially order crispy pork did not even arrived as a chinese we know that it s just a matter of cutting it into small pieces to serve to customer so why it took  hour   We ended up cancelling it toward the end of the meal  but wait it did arrived  mins after we cancelled it and when we informed the waiter that it was already cancelled as we have already finish our meal  His reaction was   fxxxing out you joking rite   I went to all this trouble to get it for you    At that point he was pulled away by another staff  I can fully understand as it must have took him almost  hours to  get it    Readers I don t normally write review but this experience is so bad I felt that it must be shared  
negative; The food is ok  but considering it takes an hour to arrive I won t be bothering in the future  terrible service 
negative; Had a really nice roast platter for  there a couple of weeks ago so went back today   unfortunately not a good experience this time  The portion size had decreased since last time and our platter of food came out very quickly which made us suspect that it hadn t been freshly prepared and we were probably right    Roast beef was full of gristle and extremely tough  I left most of it  and some of the roast potatoes were bad and had to be replaced  My carrot was raw and I couldn t cut it so I left that  also they had forgotten the Yorkshire pudding and we had to ask for it  along with gravy  On a plus note  the dessert for sharing was nice  
negative;We booked a table for pm  the earliest they start serving evening food  we were looking forward to an enjoyable meal  especially as we had family down from Yorkshire who we don t see regularly  we can honestly say we did not have an enjoyable meal   The waitress managed to only take a drinks order for  people before walking away  one of us had to call her back to take the other two orders   The food took over an hour to be served  despite there being very few tables of guest because it was early in the evening   people had ordered medium steaks  they both came out well done  when we sent them back one of the chefs came out to apologise for  of the steaks  then proceeded to argue that the other had been cooked medium   which it definitely had not  surely the customer is always right    The steaks were re cooked  but it meant another long wait  some of us had already finished eating our meals by the time the steaks had been re cooked  how long does it take to cook a steak  We also noticed that guests were using the kids playing area as a smoking area  surely that s not safe for kids  We did complain about the awful serving and food and the manager halved our bill but it does not make up for our experience at The Galleon  I would not recommend this pub to anyone I know  and I would advise those of you reading this to AVOID THE GALLEON AT ALL COSTS 
negative; Having been to the Dunsforth quite a few times for lunch we as a family decided to book for Christmas lunch  How we all regretted it   On arrival it was absolute chaos every one pushed in the bar area  No Christmas greeting no atmosphere   People grumbling as we all had to wait for the tables to be set  it was completely understaffed customers having to go for their own drinks  Our table was for   having been served food which on this occasion can only be described as mass catering we x others left    hours later forsaking coffee x mince pies   An experience never to be repeated signed A very disgruntled customer   
negative; I don t usually do reviews but I felt compelled to after our takeaway from Zing Zing last Friday   April    The interestingly named  Morning Glory  was a measly few stringy chinese greens  soaked in a salty  vinegary solution and was barely two mouth fulls   Two noodle dishes were literally drenched in soy sauce which made them incredibly salty  These ended up in the bin after a few attempts as the salt overpowered any flavour and really put us off  You know that taste when you swallow sea water  Yep  like that   Avoid unless you are seriously lacking in sodium chloride and like to throw money away  
negative;My husband and I were staying in Warwick and I took him to the Pot and Fin  We ordered two large haddock and chips to take away  we were told that the food is cooked fresh so there is a  minute wait  in fact it was  minutes  When the food arrived I opened the lid of the box to find minuscule portions  and very very soggy batter that had not been cooked  The chips were even worse a very small portion of soggy chips  All this cost nearly I spoke to the manager and showed him my food and he said he thought it looked ok and shrugged his shoulders   I immediately asked for my money back at first he did not want to but it it surprising what a loud voice can do when other people are waiting  He gave me a refund straight away  Will not return 
negative;This used to be my go to Chinese takeaway  It used to be really tasty and did delivery to Haywards Heath within   minutes  took card  and food was hot and tasted like it had just been cooked before being passed to delivery driver    The last time I ordered  we called after  minutes asking where our food was  We were advised that the driver had left  minutes ago and was just about to arrive  After  hours   minutes  the food arrived piping hot  They had clearly forgotten our order and did it on the spot after we complained    Tonight  we ordered and were told it would be  minutes  After more than  minutes  the delivery driver turned up  apologised for the delay stating that they had a large amount of orders  but not to worry because the food was still hot    The food was room temperature on a cold September evening  Very very disappointed with the lengthy wait  bearing in mind this cost nearly   for a couple of people  I d rather be given a realistic timeline and wait for HOT food  than told an unrealistic timeline and given cold food    After two disappointing orders in a row  I will not be ordering from here again  It is cheaper  quicker and nicer to just use my own recipe
negative; We visited on Easter Monday  we sat upstairs as there was a large group of us  We had to ask if they could open upstairs to accommodate for us  we could have probably sat downstairs  but one of the staff was taking up a full table with his laptop  We ordered food  my husband and i ordered first   tapas selections and a meat platter  our food arrived last out of the group   the meat board was nowhere to be seen  We mentioned this to the gentleman who brought the food out   he had no idea what we were on about  he eventually came back and refunded us  We were not actually given the option to still have the platter The food for the rest of the group was sub standard  salty   the service was terrible  We spoke to a gentleman with Glasses on  but he obviously has no skills dealing with a customer complaint   in all  it was a poor show from the riverside  drink orders were wrong  food delayed or forgotten about and  young lads running the show who basically couldn t give a dam about the customers  
negative;I have been to the Plough many times and have enjoyed our meals greatly but this meal was a complete farce  I went with a party of  for my husband s grandparents th Wedding Anniversary on Saturday  It had been booked since February  We booked to go in the study so we can be private and away from other diners  But my mother in law found out on Thursday that we could not go in the study as it was being re carpeted  so we would have to sit in the conservatory  We would not have known this if she hadn t called  We arrived and saw that the study had not been re carpeted and it was set up ready for people to use  We were rather confused  We got to the our seats and arrived at a building site  There were rolls of carpet and buckets of floor paste on the floor which people could have tripped over We had to move them ourselves  Plus there was loads of sawdust all over the floor which had come from the workmen outside  The dust had gotten on the cutlery  which we had to wipe off  The waitress has trouble taking our order as there was so many of us  They should have sent  to take it  The starter was rather bland but the carvery was nice  But no one came to clear our plates  We were sat waiting for ages  Eventually we went and spoke to some one about our disappointment  The manager would not come down and speak to us  We were told that they didn t think we would fit in the study so they moved us  But we counted the seats and saw that  people could have fitted and there were only  of us  We felt cheated and we felt our special occasion had been ruined so we refused to pay the full amount  This pub is going down hill  They can not cope with large parties and should have closed off the area we ate as a danger and health hazard  Very very disappointed 
negative; Like the previous review  I had already had  good experiences at the Inn in terms of service  I hadn t actually eaten there  but had good service while drinking and took  friends for dinner  Imagine my shock and horror by the rudeness of the staff  We were abused by FOUR members of staff  culminating with the manager who was the rudest of all  
negative; Don t be fooled by the beautiful grounds this pub is on  Looks amazing outside  The outside was the best bit at this place  But once in  its old  empty and of very poor quality  I would not recommend this to anyone  I went with my family for my sisters th birthday and we were so disappointed  She found a dead spider in her starter salad  Which was apologised for and given a free drink  but that s not the point  when paying  + for four meals  finding a dead spider is not on  Our main meals arrived  however  these were also not good to even look at  never mind to eat  Our meals were piled high with chips  which weren t cooked and seemed to of received the old  mouldy ones  We all left our meal  such waste of money and not an th birthday meal to remember  The staff were standing about doing nothing  stood behind bar  with arms crossed as the pub was so empty  Looked as if they didn t even won t to be there  Moaning about how happy they ll be when they finish work   Man who looked in charge  sitting down  reading newspaper drinking a pint of beer  So unprofessional  Won t ever be going here again  I won t be recommending this place to anyone  very embarrassed that we eve stepped foot and ate in that place  
negative;I ve been to the boot quite a few times over the past  years or so and despite it getting gradually worse  some nostalgic memory of a good meal kept pulling me back  Not again though  I have finally realised that this gorgeous pub just can t deliver a decent meal  The final straw was last Wednesday evening  I ordered the crispy duck salad as a main for    which contained about  tiny pieces of duck  half of which was fat  The sauce and salad part were ok  but definitely not worth the money  if you want a decent pub meal for about the same price I would recommend going to The Turks Head in Alcester  The food is Superb  The atmosphere is great and the service is spot on 
negative; Me and my boyfriend thought that whilst we had an evening free we would go somewhere easy for a last minute dinner  We thought as Hobby Horse is local  BIG REGRET  The table was sticky so we moved to three others  all as sticky as each other  obviously not been cleaned  wine was served in a tall glass rather then a wine glass  the bar staff looked like they hadn t been bothered to shower in a good month  yeah you went to a festival in    why are you still wearing all the bands  if that wasn t a sign to go elsewhere then the  deal was  both ordered a meal for should then be   for us both   not quite  they over charged us brought us the wrong food  Could not have chosen a worse venue in chesterfield  STAY AWAY  
negative;We went here as a family of  for breakfast  Two of the breakfasts on the order were for poached eggs and when both of the meals came the poached eggs looked as if they had been poaching since the point that the order was taken  The white of the egg was grey and rubbery while the yolk was absolutely rock solid  I wouldn t usually send anything back but I was really annoyed that the chef thought that sending eggs out like this for breakfast was acceptable   The staff are all young and doing a fairly good job whilst being let down by the kitchen  Although  when very hot drinks were brought  the young man who delivered them said he didn t want to pass the drinks over to the adults as they were hot  so instead left them right next to two little ones  Not really sure of the logic of this    We won t be returning   
negative; Got rid of firm favourites like sweet potato fries and some of the nice wraps  Also no more gluten free options listed which is really limiting  thoroughly disappointed in this change  I used to come here all the time with a GF friend but we ll go elsewhere now 
negative; Visited    ordered a guinness when I had drank   of it I noticed the glass had vegetation in it  Took it back to the bar they said oh it is nothing we will give you another  No thanks  They did not offer to refund my money which is what I wanted  Will never go there again 
negative; Went in for a bar meal  abandoned plates   glasses everywhere  took long enough to try   get a drink let alone anything to eat  This place years ago was  quot the place  quot  sadly no more  
negative; Shocking service  Ordered a fish platter and  minutes later it was delivered Cold  Sent it back and after  minutes I called the manager over  She said it would be  minutes  No apology just you will have to wait  When the food finally arrived guess what it was luke warm  I sent it back And asked for my money back  She brought me the money and told me that the kitchen had told her it was the right temperature so quite clearly you need s new thermometer as luke warm food is not acceptable  If I hadn t of heard  other people complaining of the delay and one other person complaining about a cold apple pie in the middle I would of classed it as a one off but as I heard the other  people complaining I seriously think that as a company you need to look into you staff and complaints procedure as I will never be going back to this pub and I don t think the other  people will  
negative; Food was cold  service was rushed  felt staff wanted us shipped in and shipped out as fast as they could  wasnt a relaxed lunch at all  staff hoverd around waiting for us to finish so someone else could have our table 
negative;Went to La Margherita last night to celibrate a birthday  Our table was booked for   our party was   The place was very quiet  with what appeared like more staff than customers at times  After being given the menu we were asked for our drinks order which took far too long to come and then were ignored for at least mins  We had to ask for service to make any orders during the whole night and no one came to find out if our meal s were satisfactory at any point during our time there  The staff were more concerned that we choose music for the DJ to play  After we finally got desert the staff came to sing happy birthday and gave our party member another desert which was ridiculous as she had already had one desert   When the bill arrived and we saw the cost of service added we complained that there had been no service and we were not willing to pay for something that did not exist at this resaurant  One of our party talked to the Manager who accepted  but was obviously not happy about our decision  He was also not willing to come over and talk to the rest of us They did offer us  free bottles of wine  expecting us to drink it there and then but this was at : when we were finally finished and ready to go  I would not recommend this restuarant to anyone  The only saving grace there is that the food is OK 
negative; My husband and I were shown in and seated   minutes later the waiter came over as if to serve us but instead cleared the dessert from the table of  next to us  A further  minutes later he came back  bypassed us once again  and went back to the table of  to take their coffee order  which took forever  We asked to be served and were abruptly told  quot in a moment quot   A further  minutes passed with no sign of a member of staff to even take our drinks order let alone food  we got up to leave and told the manager we had been waiting over  minutes to be served and his reply was  quot ok  goodbye quot  I ve never known a restraunt to have such a rude and dismissive attitude towards their potential patrons  Would I recommend them    NO  
negative; I booked a table here for my birthday  When I arrived with my family they claimed to have no record of my booking and refused to sort anything out claiming that our party of eight was too large for a Saturday night  When I explained that it was my birthday and it would be difficult to go elsewhere the woman just shrugged her shoulders and turned her back on me  which left me feeling very upset indeed  There is a happy ending to the story though as we walked up the road to Zizzi s where we had a great meal and a bottle of bubbly on the house too  
negative; Having experienced Francos in the s and revisiting Carlisle in August  I chose Francos but have to say how bitterly disappointing  The service was slow with disengaging waiters who by the time of my : reservation were preparing to go home  The Restaurant has clearly lost sight of what is good food and good service  The garlic bread starter was dry and severely lacking in the primary ingredient and the Pollo Rosmarino main course was a dry stringy piece of chicken presented in a small bowl on a bed of out of date shredded iceberg lettuce with  olives and a couple of bits of pepper and certainly not worthy of the    charged  Staff were carrying black bags of rubbish and crates full of empty bottles through the dining room and to add to the ambiance was the sound of smashing glass into skips  Both the starter and main were returned and my disappointment aired to the waiter who simply presented me with the bill for the full price of the meal  When asked if he was serious he simply said  I am and that s the way it is   This is one restaurant to AVOID  
negative; A lovely position on the promenade but that s all  You enter the building by walking past piles and piles of uneaten food on plates stacked high accompanied by half drink drinks with wasps and flies  Yuk  You then enter the building past the most disgusting smelly toilets  Oh my word  Walk in and walk straight back out  I know it s the customers who use the facilities but its the staff who should be cleaning up plates and glasses and ensuring the place is inviting  No  not flies and possible tummy upsets but happy  paying customers  Not a chance   people eating elsewhere in town  
negative; On my birthday  together with  friends  we were sat at the captain s table and the verdict is NO  don t ruin your party by thinking that Awaydine is a good idea   Reasons: far from enough room at the captain s table and the service was    rude  plain rude  On my birthday    I have been a year before in couple format and it was a beautiful romantic experience but this time the lady was incredibly rude to us  
negative; I enjoyed the food and the setting of the restaurant but I was left waiting over half an hour for my cocktail to arrive  I thought I would give it time as I know they can take longer to make than usual drinks but over half an hour is a bit of a joke  it was a table of  and I was the only one without a drink  when it finally arrived there was no apology and it wasn t even worth the wait  when the bill arrived they had charged for two cocktails  when I had only had the one  Again when this was brought to their attention  no apology again  when they had finally corrected the bill  it wasn t readable or professional in anyway  my three year old niece could of done a better job  Instead of taking feedback  they weren t interested and took offence  Surely when you own a restaurant it is part of parcel to take the good with the bad  admit your mistakes  rectify the issue and make sure it doesn t happen again obviously not in their case   Just another restaurant willing to take your money but not providing a good service   The owner or manager  waltzing about in his suite needs to think about the service he is providing rather than just his image   cringe    
negative; Food is like eating in a school cafeteria  Even though this more like eating in a warehouse  It had absolutely no atmosphere at all    The food was disgusting  and I actually mean that  I asked for a lasagne to be made up for me and it was microwaved in front of my eyes The food tasted watered down and of very low quality  The dessert selection was particularly poor and what was on offer on the website does not apply to what is actually available    The staff rush around like mad trying there best  I cannot fault the staff  The food however I would say is not suitable for families because children would have very limited amount to eat  I am a very fussy eater that s why we chose to go to a buffet because of the  wide selection  and even I struggled    Don t waste your money and go somewhere else  McDonald s is better and that s saying something  
negative; After enjoying a great movie we decided this would be the restaurant that we wanted to eat at  At the door was a sign saying  quot please wait here to be seated quot   It was obvious the restaurant was busy  but nonetheless  someone could have said   quot we will be with you quot   We waited for five minutes whilst three staff had looked at us  but did not want to engage  That would have meant they would have had to do something  Finally my husband said  quot is anyone going to see to us quot   Finally someone turned and said   quot yes just a minute quot   We both said  do not bother and walked away  WE WILL NEVER EAT THERE ON PRINCIPLE  Restaurants number one priority should be service  and this place certainly did not offer it  We went to a restaurant four doors away Chimicango  and had excellent service  and whilst standing at the entrance three people said  quot we will be right with you  Now that is service  
negative; Just spent such a disappointing evening at this establishment  Eight of us went for a meal on Sunday evening   pm  Oct  to celebrate my mum s th birthday  Mum doesn t like going to places she doesn t know and booked the New Broom because we ve been several times in the past and enjoyed the food  the service  the atmosphereƒ?Ýƒ?Ýƒ?Ýƒ?Ý how things have changed at the New Broom in the several months since we last visited  I called in at lunch time on the same day to deliver a cake and to buy a bottle of sparkling wine which I asked be at the table ready to pour on our arrival  When we were eventually shown to our table there was no wine as requested and when I enquired about it the waitress looked a little confused as though she knew nothing about it  When the waitress reappeared a short while later  the wine glasses were placed at the end of the table for us to help ourselves to  standard wine glasses not flutes which was a shame as it was a celebration   the bottle of wine was  dumped   for want of a better word  unopened with ice piled on top of it in a wine cooler  The best entertainment of the night was us trying to get the bottle out of the cooler without spilling ice all over the table as it was piled on top of the bottle  Luckily we had some children in our party who thought it great fun to catch the ice as I extracted the bottle and proceeded to open it   The menu was mediocre and the choice disappointing  The food was average  insignificant  typical brewery food  The restaurant was cold and draughty by the end of the night  the heating had clearly been switched off some time before we had even arrived   The music  which seemed to be the same five tracks on loop  stopped playing by  pm which made us feel completely unwelcome  That  combined with the fact the staff were stood in a group  chatting   gave us the impression they just wanted us to leave  Things didn t get better when it came to presenting the cake which I had delivered at lunch time and asked to be brought to the table when the coffee was served  A long time after we had finished coffee we had to ask TWICE for the cake to be brought and had to ask my mum to wait as she was putting her coat on ready to leave  The second time we asked  the waitress indicated that she hadn t brought the cake because she didn t know who it was for  It had a  on it and there was only one person at the table anywhere near that age  It was a hand crafted cake which had taken hours to make and decorate and when I delivered it earlier in the day  I asked specifically for the candles to be inserted into the holes in the centres of the flowers  where they had been previously but removed to allow the lid to be placed on the box   However  when the cake arrived  this had been completely ignored and the candles were placed randomly about the cake  anywhere except where I had explicitly asked them to be  The lack of care and attention was disappointing to say the least and actually quite disrespectful considering how long it had taken to decorate  Having spent ten years in the local restaurant trade I was dismayed to see what one of our local establishments had turned into  The fast turnover  pile it high  cheap mass produced food is clearly aimed at a market far from the discerning diner  My mum paid the bill and even left a tip because she is far too polite to do otherwise  I didn t want to make her birthday meal even more upsetting and disappointing than it had already turned out to be and therefore chose not to say anything at the time  it would also have been difficult to have spoken to anyone at the time as no one seemed to be in charge   However  we have all discussed it since and felt exactly the same    Although we won t ever be frequenting this establishment again  we felt it only fair to provide some feedback about our visit and the reasons for us not returning  We certainly won t be recommending this establishment to anyone  
negative; Tried twice and both times horrible long waits even though empty tables left and right  One time we had to wait    hours even though it was a TUESDAY AFTERNOON and the restaurant had not even  tables full  Staff left and right not having anything to do and just walking bored in circles   Waiters both times didn t get the orders right    We both ordered the same ribs  but one rack tasted funky and rotten  Still feeling sick thinking about it  
negative; I was incredibly disappointed with the service and organisation of The Botanist from start to finish when I went for a Christmas dinner with  of my friends   I had booked a table far in advance prior to the meal and had received a confirmation text so I assumed everything was sorted  However a couple of weeks later I rang up to explain that one of my guests was no longer attending  They then proceeded to say that they had no record of my reservation but let me book then  luckily  I then paid my deposit but had no confirmation to say that this was accepted  neither did they question to what I wanted as my order   When we arrived for our reserved time only  minutes late we were not greeted politely and with Christmas cheer and were told that we only had an hour and a half to eat three courses in the darkest area where a couple of lights were not working  A couple of the waiting staff who served us were very kind which made the experience slightly more bearable but we felt rushed and like we were not wanted there  At quarter past   as soon as our time was up  we were told that we had to leave but we have a table reserved for us outside  in a cold marquee I understand Christmas is a busy time and stressful for staff  but it is also a time for happiness and kindness  something that was not delivered at the Botanist  We were really looking forward to our evening but we were let down hugely  
negative; Having spent a day shopping in Leicester  my partner and I decided to stop off for a quick lunch in Ed s Diner  From the outside  the  s American theme is inviting and we thought it would be something different to the copious amounts of eateries in Leicester   We approached the till area where you re supposed to wait until seated for a girl with a miserable face mutter for us to follow her and point to a table  Not saying a word to us  she handed us the menu and walked away  She approached us again two seconds later to take our orders and stood with a stone cold expression on her face as we asked for another minute to decide  With her looming over us  we quickly scanned the ridiculously expensive menu for something to eat and drink  Having decided  she nodded and walked off   She returned with our drinks and put them down and walked away without saying anything to us whatsoever   Our food arrived and we weren t asked if there was anything else we needed  so we had to call her back and ask for some sauce  The drinks are stated on the menu as  free refills  but we were not asked once if we would like a refill  The burgers were pretty average  nothing that sets them aside from any other fast food joint   To make our dining experience even better  as we were still eating our shared chips  the girl came over and just took our plates and left us with the bowl of chips   not like we were going to use them or anything  We felt as if we were being rushed out when the restaurant was half empty  Safe to say we got the bill and abruptly left  The reason I m going into so much detail about this is that I am truly unimpressed with the absolute lack of service in this establishment  considering how much we actually spent in there  I would not recommend this place to anybody unless they want a side of bad attitude with their burger   The restaurant has so much potential as a classic American Diner  like I said before  there are no other kind of establishments like this in Leicester  However  the pure lack of customer service left us feeling unwelcome and reluctant to go back again  What a shame  
negative; Having been to the West Swindon cinema we decided to stop by this restaurant for Chinese dinner but I wish we hadn t    This is the rd time we have been here and it has really gone down hill quite rapidly and dramatically    The service was quick and friendly but the establishment appeared shabby and unclean  The food had clearly been sitting there all day and looked dry and unappetizing   We tried several of the dishes and with the crispy quid being the only exception all were either dry  overcooked  overly salty  rubbery or like dishwater   In the fact the food was so complety disgusting and inedible that I felt the need to advise the manager  My complaint was met with indifference and the arrogance of   nobody else has complained   The manager did nothing to  make good  the situation   We ate nothing more  paid and left  Needless to say we shall not be returning   
negative;My friends really wanted to go here but i had been before and i did not like it but I went again and it was worse than I thought  Portions are small especially the rice they serve with the kebabs its like  spoonfuls of rice  Service is crap and the meat smells  I had one of my worst barg kebabs here  I really have no idea why people go here and it is always busy  Busy does not mean good in this circumstance  As I know Iranian food very well Iranian people themselves would not like this place  Mahdi in hammersmith is better and hafez down the road is much better  The only people who seem to enjoy this place are non iranian who really do not know iranian food at all  I have not been sadaf for a while which is one min away from alounak but i would like to think its better than alounak 
negative;I visited with my family on New Year s Day  When we arrived we was seated  The waitress took about  minutes to come   get our drink order  When we was ordering our food a few items was not a available that was on the menu  The food came at a reasonable time but was burnt  The waiters   waitress was not bothered in working that day as they all had a table for themselves   was eating their food    talking amongst themselves  Poor poor service   rubbish food  I would never go back again 
negative; Very poor second visit  After recently being recommended the three acres we tried it for lunch which was excellent  food  atmosphere and staff  we appreciated that it would be pricey but it was well worth it  We enjoyed the visit so much that we booked in again  this time in the evening  I live two plus hours drive away and so was very much anticipating a similar experience  Despite several empty tables for two  in the bar  we were plonked alone at the remotest far side of an empty large dining room totally lacking any kind of atmosphere  We questioned this as would have preferred to have sat amongst other diners in the cosy bar areas  We told by the waitress not to worry as other people were booked in  We sat alone for almost half an hour  In the even another two couples were shown into the dining room  I checked over the next couple of hours and there were still empty tables in the cosy bar areas throughout  I firmly believe that the diners were spread out  to prevent any areas appearing to be empty  The waitress was attentive  The food could have and should have saved the evening  however  the mackerel starter had only a tiny piece of actual fish but came with a large fishy  not particularly nice  sort of undercooked very fishy  fish cake  My main course  the special cod loin  the cod piece was barely a child sized portion  and terrible value for    the buttered greens  cabbage  was so massively over salted to be barely edible  like a mouthful of bicarb and sodium  The deserts were a million miles from being cleverly balanced and special  The chocolate fondant pudding itself was very nice  beautifully cooked but very very sweet but then was served with seriously sweetened cherries  sweet sweet cherry ice cream and a sickly sweet white chocolate melted shape  It was one of the worst completely sugar over loaded deserts i have ever eaten  pretty horrible really and could have been fantastic if balanced out by something plain and perhaps something a bit sharp  The treacle tart and licorice ice cream was also extremely sweet  understandably treacle tart will be sweet  however the pastry was also heavily sweetened and actually hard and dry  There was no balance to this dish either  so sweet   We both have a sweet  rather than savory tooth  but these two deserts were not up to scratch and not pleasant to eat  We were more than happy to pay almost   per desert on our first visit  however these rounded off the meal very badly  We looked at each other after the meal  shrugged and more or less crossed the three acres off our list  We didn t have great things to say during the drive home    wasted  I have never posted a trip adviser review before  
negative;If you compare price with quality then better don t go   Wasn t impressed at all   Customer service ok only had to wait very long time for food and drinks   Don t think coming back again
negative;Went here with kids because saw it advised on Facebook sponsor link  I am American and can be a bit picky with BBQ  My English wife agreed that everything we got was lacking seasoning not hot  and could have been made by my teen aged son  The ribs were dry and I had to send them back as I could barely get them to separate  They took it off the bill and as we were starving we ate the starter but did not enjoy it at all  I believe it was wayyy to expensive for very average or below average food  I don t know why restaurants feel it necessary to throw a load of different ingredients onto a plate and call it American  There was nothing American about the food they served in there  Basically hated it  Hope others have better luck 
negative; So this is my local and unfortunately over the years I ve seen this pub go further and futher down in everyones estimations  The people running this pub dont really seem to know what they re doing  The food menu is very basic and even though they state they have a speicals board  there s definitely nothing special about it  It also seems they re buying very cheap produce  And as for the bar selection  if you like fosters then your be okay They do a pub quiz every thursday evening but this is the same every week   boring   There is also a new member of staff in each time  obviously cant keep them   Its a shame about all the following as its such a beautiful little pub  
negative;I should have known better when we called in pm to see if they could squeeze in a table for two and the diary was almost empty  To be fair the place is lovely  the wine we chose extremely good even if a new one to us  but the food was diabolical  Rubbery snails  under cooked puy lentils  fish cooked to death and watery sauces  A similar meal on the pier are Southwold was a third the price and absolutely delicious  Go to the Salthouse Hotel if you are in Ipswich  not here 
negative; Had dinner here last night with  friends  We all live locally and all eat out a lot  The drinks service was fine but it took half an hour for anyone to take our food order  We all had scallops   mine were fine but the others were dry  The pea purÇ¸e was ok but fridge cold  The pancetta bacon tasted off  Inedible  It felt and tasted as if it had been cooked a long time beforehand and kept in a plastic box  I ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad afterwards  The mozzarella was good but the tomatoes were hard  orange and tasteless  Unforgivable for an Italian restaurant  When I discussed all of the with the maitre d he said he I should have mentioned it before   no apology  He also said he would take something off the bill  Which he didn t  So we paid   each for a starter of scallops and a third of a salad and two glasses of house wine  
negative; Had this restaurant recommended although don`t know why  Went at the week end  board outside advertised  course and  course meals at special prices  We weren`t offered these menus  so we ordered from the menu we were given  My husband had veals liver for starters  it came on a  quot soggy quot  slice of bread and the liver was just like a red clot which was uneatable The explanation we were given was that it had been prepared by an apprentice chef  surely the chef should check the apprentice`s presentation and food before it leaves the kitchen  My husband ordered a pint of Thwaites`s Wainwright which was cloudy and if we had waited all night it would never have cleared On the whole  a bad experience  won`t be returning  
negative; I eat at Pizza express all the time and I m always pleased with the food and service however when I visited Sheffield to see dynamo I decided to take my partner and sister to Pizza express for lunch and I couldn t have been more dissapointed  When we went in the restaurant was quiet   or so other tables which I was surprised about because everywhere else was packed out and usually Pizza express is too but I soon realised why it was the less popular choice for people dining  The waitress showed us to our table where we then sat for  minutes watching all  members of staff stood drinking coffee and chatting amongst them selves  there was  or  tables covered in glasses and plates which needed to be cleared  When the waitress eventually came to our table we ordered  drinks and  main courses minutes later our food arrived  we were not offered any parmesan or even anymore drinks  the man serving our table was wearing a filthy apron and tracksuit bottoms and as I am a chef myself and know how restaraunts work i believe that he was most likely the pot wash  When our food arrived I asked if we could have the bill then because we were short on time however I waited  mins and the bill never arrived  in the end I asked  different members of staff for our bill and eventually it arrived after we had paid our bill  as I went to the toilet before leaving I noticed all but  member of staff sat on chairs and tables  Eating there lunch and having chat and a laugh  I was mortified that I had just spent   on the worst experience I ve ever had at a restaraunt and I m totally gutted to say it has put me off ever dining at Pizza express again   
negative; DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM START TO FINISH    Both me and my mom came for a meal here as we d had a long day shopping and finding our bearings so thought we would finish the night relaxing with an Indian  We didn t feel relaxed one bit  When we walked in we seated our selves as staff seemed to be to interested in the TV to greet us at the door  we sat down and waited roughly around  minutes for one guy to ask if we wanted to order at that we said yes   minutes after ordering we had the starters placed infront of us  about to tuck in for it to be whipped straight from under us  it wasn t ours it was and it was another tables food but the waiter did not apologise for what he d just done and how embarrassed he made us feel   FOOD WAS ALL BLAND  From starter to dessert  which looked like sick on a plate    P s   don t ask for a fork and knife for you re main because if looks could kill when you asked you d be dead    Once we d eaten our food we wanted to leave straight away  so we asked for our bill only for it to be way dearer then we expected  when we called a member of staff over his attitude stank saying the bill was that much because of service charge   Service charge we knew nothing about until the very end  he said it was stated in menu  Yet it wasn t  when we asked to see the menu his attitude become ever worse My mom refused to pay for the service charge as it was disgusting from the minute we walked in to the minute we left   If you like Indian food and waiters with a smile and good customer service  DONT GO HERE YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT    Such a shame as the only nice thing was how the Indian was decorated  
negative; I visited this branch with a friend for an early tea  Our waiter was friendly and pleasant but his clothes were very dirty and he looked unkempt  The food was brought promptly potato skins   sitting in a lots of grease  I tasted one of them and left rest  I had lasagne which was rather bland  As I was looking around my surroundings the views are fabulous I happened to glance over to the bar area to see the waiter picking ice up with his hand and putting it in glasses   I was appalled this made me leave my food ask for the bill  I won t be going back  Some people like pile it high sell it cheap this is fine if its your kind of food and standard that perfectly fine but I couldn t return  
negative;I visited Dents farm shop with my two friends but was bitterly disappointed in the meal we had  I had fish   chips the fish was okay but the chips were swimming in grease were over cooked and were not very hot  my two friends had a small ham egg and chips the chips were stone cold and again over cooked and greasy they complained and the waitress took them away and reheated them but they were still not very hot  and you could see through the ham if you held it up  the chips you could count on two hands it was a very small meal even a child would have wanted more and for    it was expensive for what they got I felt awful as I had recommended it to them but we will not be going back there again which is a pity as the surroundings are nice it was the meals and the waiting time that let them down  if they can t cope the should employ more staff   
negative;I visited Baltic Grill on a Monday for an early dinner with my brother  we were hoping to catch up over a lovely dinner but sadly this wasn t the case  Upon arrival the restaurant was empty and dark  we actually thought they were closed  The one and only waitress greeted us and asked if we wanted the English menu  We didn t quite understand what she meant so we asked what other menus does she have  Then she informed us that this was a Lithuanian restaurant  Fair enough we thought  we do love eastern European food so we looked forward to see the menu and taste the food  The menu is very simple and surprisingly expensive  We decided to get calamari as a starter and steak as the main course  Upon taking our order we tried to ask about different dishes but the waitress was very unhelpful and her attitude wasn t nice at all  She kept answering everything with  I don t know  and a frown  Our drinks were served in dirty glasses  no ice or garnish  Again for the price you pay for the food drinks here this should be a no brainer  She didn t pour the drinks to our glasses or took the lid off of the bottles  At this point I told my brother that I hope they are not expecting us to pay any service charge  After we got our drinks and we placed the order the waitress sat herself at a table not far from us and was on her phone throughout our  minutes there  We asked her for a steak knife she did not understand what we wanted so we had to use an awful knife that was completely unfit for eating a steak I HAD TO WALK to her desk to ask for some garlic mayo for our calamari which came with sweet chilli dipping  I was half tempted to ask my brother to leave at this point  There was no music or other customers around us just this loud awful Lithuanian TV channel with a horrendous movie on  It was very annoying  I totally get if this was on where there were no customers around as it must be really boring there all day waiting for customers but this should be switched to at least an English channel or some music when people come in as ambiance is quite important when it comes to have a nice diner somewhere  Things got even worse when we received our steak  It looked absolutely disgusting and tasted even worse  It looked and tasted like the cheapest frying steak you can get from Lidl or probably Morrisons next door  I was absolutely starving but could not eat the food  I wouldn t even expect my dog to eat something like that  I have never had to leave such a bad review in my entire life but strongly think that the management should re think their strategy and perhaps get employees in who can cook and treat customers the way they should be treated  I feel ripped off by paying over   for  x starter and  x horrendous chewy disgusting piece of meat with drink served in dirty glasses  I will never return to Baltic Grill and hopefully after reading my review you won t be either  It s a complete waste of money and time 
negative; Personal hygiene is clearly not a strong point of the people that work here  They STINK    To the point where it lingers around you and your food for so long  you actually feel like your eating their body odour   Food is ok but gave us a bad tummy the next day  There s not a great deal to choose from  If you go in the evening it s very loud  You will be lucky if you get one drink  Don t expect to be asked for any more   One word to sum it up  AWFUL 
negative;I visited this establishment along with  other Friends   We ordered  garlic breads to start which after about  minutes  arrived at our table  they didn t come with the topping we d asked for   the waitress looked flustered and stressed so we left it as a mistake   Then our mains came  what a disaster  Our meals were ALL very bland and tasteless   My friend had th calzone  it was swimming in oil and was vile   The bill came to about    with not much food eaten we stopped off for a snack on the way home avoid this place  Disgraceful 
negative;My family and I went to the Horse and Jockey for a meal yesterday evening  it saddens me to write such a poor review as this is our local pub  with all three families living within easy walking distance   On arrival we were warned there was an hour and a half wait for food  the restaurant did not appear busy  so we were unsure why  but after getting our drinks squeezed around a small table to choose our meals  Decisions made we went to order from the till where again we were warned of the wait and proceeded to order  out of the choices we made the lasagne was not available  the steak and ale pie was not available  the steak and kidney pie was not available and our alternative choice of sirloin steak was available  but only  not   Disappointing start to the meal  When the meals came we had to sort amongst ourselves the incorrect potatoes chips wrongly put on the plates  the jacket potato we ordered was nowhere to be seen  The steak quality was variable  from good to very poor mostly consisting of fat and gristle  The chips were cold  the onion rings good and peas acceptable  The sauces were very good   After completing our meals  which we did indeed wait an hour and a half for  we tried to order pudding  we were told that food service stopped at   So we waited patiently for a long time for an unsatisfactory meal and consequently ran out of time for pudding  There was no chance of discussion as chef had his coat on and was going out of the door   We paid for our meals  with the cost of one removed from the bill and made it clear we would not be returning to eat  ever  So sad that this local pub is now off our places to visit for family meals  sad to see its decline  
negative; Booked a table for my anniversary on a Sunday only to be told on arrival that the restaurant was shut on a Sunday  Had to sit on chairs that were obviously from a jumble sale and order from a very mediocre bar menu  The dish the fish pie was served in tapered down so the surface area was  times that of the base  so little fish   bland  sauce but plenty of potatoes  Chips with the battered cod were very poor  Very disappointing from that of our first visit  years ago 
negative; Visited Terrace Bar Georgian Restaurant in September  My son had chicken soup followed by steak and spent the night being violently sick  Avoid  
negative; We visited Grand Central on Saturday afternoon  approx pm  so the restaurant was very quiet but even so  we waited  minutes before our drinks orders were taken  Our food arrived after a further  minutes and the waitress rushed off before offering sauces or any other drinks  Finally we managed to flag another waitress down to request more drinks and ketchup  These never arrived  By the time we had finished our food I was so thirsty  I walked to the bar and got my own drink   The food was mediocre at best  My husband paid   for a burger but they forgot the cheese  bbq sauce and bacon  The ribs were   and I could have got better quality from a supermarket   We wont ever be going back 
negative;dirty  lack of organization  support of more people can not cope  there is chaos  no more do not take my family there 
negative; I have eaten here a few times and had a rather pleasant experience until this evening when a party of  of us went in at :pm and finally got served our mains at roughly : : without a request for starters  The excuse of they are really busy was exercised even though there were a party of  and a party of  who were served after us  fed and paid within the hour  Not only that the biryani was extremely garlicky  the pasanda was mistaken for a korma by our waiter  it tasted bland  and another s dish tasted like pure salt  Someone had to wait half an hour for a pint of cobra  We were offered a free round of drinks due to the fact nobody really ate their mains  one person sent it back and refused it  A free round of drinks does not excuse the poor excuses  the poor service and the extremely poor quality in food  It is extremely unfortunate as I had recommended it in the first place  Note to self go to lidl s  I think I would get better quality and service in there 
negative; I really love giving my money to local cafes restaurants however the service I received from the owner waiter was simply unacceptable  When inquiring about drinks the waiter responded sarcastically and rudely  remarked bitterly that one of us ordered a tap water  even though when others ordered beers and was sharp toned throughout  All in all it made the whole meal a rather uncomfortable experience  I wouldn t usually complain but hopefully the owner will read this and make changes  As it could be a really lovely place    The one other time I visited for lunch the woman who served was a lot nicer  
negative; I went here for the first time on Saturday We were in a party of   We arrived on time but had to wait in the bar area for approximately  minutes I heard no apologies or explanation  We were shown to the table and there weren t enough seats  We had to chairs dumped at the end of a long table  but we were sat together after our starter  The starter was very tasty and plentiful  My first choice for the main was lobster ravioli there was none available  an alternative was offered which sounded lovely  when the plate arrived there was a good amount  sadly it was tasteless  I left half of it  My husband said his steak was good but the mushrooms were slimy and slug like  his veg was more raw than al dente  I cant tell you what starter he had as was  people away from him  Friends were being served  minutes after others in the party  Not a pleasant experience  I will never go again and can t believe that a restaurant can t cope with large parties  When the birthday boy complained presumably the manager started shouting saying there will be delays as everything is cooked to order  I ve been to many restaurants in many towns and cities and most of those cooked meals to order and that din t seem to cause a problem  If they can t cope with large parties don t let them book  
negative; We went to Old Bank for our workmate s leaving do   I called on Wednesday to book for Thursday night    pm  I was told that we must pre  order  Our group was meant to be up to  people but I explained that as the meal is only next day  it may be difficult to get everyone to pre order  I spoken to  different people and I was told that the chef expects a pre order   That wasn t really helpful  When we arrived to the restaurant  there was only  other table there and the place wasn t busy during our meal there  I visited the Old Bank previously and the service was usually professional  That wasn t the case this time  We felt rushed  my colleagues didn t even get a chance to sit down before being asked for a drink order  Both of the waitresses were rather unfriendly   What was quite shocking for us  without asking if we re ready  the food was arriving to our table  That was just a couple of minutes after the last of our colleagues arrived  his drink hasn t even arrived at this point  I m pretty sure that everywhere else the customers are asked if they re ready for the meal   The food was ok  We definitely expected better quality  One of us ordered a cheese board   he literally got  small wedges of cheese  We were disappointed with the service  It all felt like we were in a way   Also none of us smokes and we could clearly smell the cigarette smoke from one of the guys serving us  Shame  
negative;I was not asked if I wanted a medium or large sized coffee and the staff then put it through the till as a large  clearly to get more money out of me  My BLT was full of lettuce with barely any bacon which I found disgusting considering the price of it  I won t be visiting this cafe again 
negative; We ve been visiting Looe for many years   we ll never eat at Kelly s again  we waited  minutes for our meal to arrive   it wasn t very warm so we had to return it  An older member of staff was shouting at two of the younger girls in front of customers  which was very uncomfortable for us as customers   the young girls  it certainly wasn t very professional  The whole experience was not nice  not only will we never return  we would not recommend Kelly s to anyone  
negative;A very poor experience had by all four of us  Supposed to be a couple of vegetarian options  but the cottage pie wasn t available and I didn t fancy the cauliflower tart  Ended up with a cheese salad which was awful  Hardly anything to eat Fionn had beef lasagne a dried up square of something that looked like it had been reheated several times So did the fish and chips We complained but had no apology or recompense A great shame as the position of this hotel is so good right next to the tourist information 
negative; Went to the Water Rat on a lovely sunny evening on the  July at about pm  Was told that there was not much food available but we could have fish and chips  Sat at the table and by the time they came to take our order we were told that fish and chips was no longer available  we could have the burger without the bun  steak or gammon  Didn t fancy any of those so decided to go elsewhere  unfortunately we had already had a drink  thinking we were going to have food  and had to queue for quite a time to pay for these    Did say at the time I wasn t very happy and I was told that my complaint would be passed on   It amazes me that on a beautiful sunny evening  in a pub by the river  they did not think they might need to stock up for an influx of customers    Shame we are quire local but would not repeat this experience  
negative;Had excellent meals here in the past when staying in nearby holiday cottage but just had a very disappointing meal  there were other negative reviews in our guest book   Service was great but the food was poor and was over priced for the quality  Won t be back 
negative; The service was beyond slow and there was no one in the restaurant  Once the waitress came to us she shouted at us from the end of the table to take our order  there was eight of us dining for my niece s st birthday  It was far too hot  we had to keep gong outside to cool down even when we asked the waitress to adjust the air con  The food was awful  the specific orders were ignored so four of our party didn t eat what they were given  The music playing was seemingly on a loop so we heard Stevie Wonder six times whilst there  I would suggest you eat anywhere but this restaurant for every reason  absolutely terrible all round  
negative; Me and my friends are regulars here as we come for the half price Monday offer  The food is good however the service is always awful  They take sometimes  minutes just for water and numerous times we have had to ask people to clear our table  On this occasion you had to have ID to be just eating past pm  Every other time we have been we have not been ID ed to just sit in the restaurant  No alcohol purchased  So having to rush after getting there at   to eat our meal we had to leave as  of our friends didn t bring their ID  No notice or apologies for this inconvenience  
negative;We attempted a walk in for the restauarant at lunchtime on my birthday and were told they were fully booked and unable to accomodate us  This would have been fine if the restaurant wasnt empty  Whilst sitting in the bar area and ordering lunch there  we saw all of ONE family head into the restaurant area  They could have easily accomodated  people for the quick lunch we wanted  even if more customers showed up later   The member of staff that served us had no clue what he was doing but it was only his second day and was pleasant enough for us not to mind spending an extra few minutes getting our orders in  even if his colleagues werent as patient  We waited over an hour for our food to come and it wasn t served together  By the time the first meal had arrived and been finished  the second came and was finished but the third was still nowhere to be seen  We had to ask and was told it was on its way  although we have our suspisions that it wasnt put through  Around an hour an a half had past by the time the third and final meal arrived so it wasnt the  quot quick bite quot  that we intended to have  This is even more ridiculous when it s noted that the food we ordered were  sandwiches and a salad  The place was very quiet and a wait this long just should not have happened for such simple dishes  The worst thing was the meals didnt come to our table together and we were forced to watch eachother eat while becoming increasingly hungry and impatient  I also ordered some nachos and the salsa tasted like ketchup  Very unimpressed and would not come back 
negative;Really sad    had heard such positive reviews  but when we came to order half of our choices were no longer available  at pm on a Wednesday evening  and what we had as our second choice was average  The staff were in there own dream world  We wanted to order a second drink but couldn t get anyone s attention so we just went up to the bar  paid the bill and left  I don t doubt this place could be really excellent  but there s too much competition around to offer such poor service
negative;Food was okay  Did the eatas much as you like for Best starter was the satay chicken  however one of the pieces of hicken in the middle was still pink   Had a crispy chilli beef for a main which was passable except for the fact there was no beef in the crispy bits  Good sauce and crunch though   Upon trying to go back and order some more food we were waiting around  mins for the lady to come back over despite only being the second occupied table in the restaurant  When she did come over we enquirer about going again and ordering some more food    Due to the chilli nature of my crispy non beef I had left some of the Chillis and we had left some rice  The lady then said that we could only order more if we ate it all   in a very judgemental accusatory tone  Now we re paying spending almost   each  they add a % service charge   a joke  if I want to leave a little rice and some of the Chillis from my meal  I will  It s a eat as much as you like  I would have liked to keep the rice to be able to try another main but after her saying that I was fuming    We asked for the bill  at this point I think it clicked how rude she had been as she started asking is repeatedly if there was anything else we were after   Add on the fact when we arrived there was one table occupied  she was joking with one of the members  he d said Oooh I think you have customers  She d looked at us and ignored us  he then said it again  secs odd later and she only then came over  I simply cannot express how much of an abismal experience this was  I can only think a few people go there still because stony is mainly filled with Indians  Should have stuck with the Royal Thai  They are amazing and the food is always really fresh and delicious  lovely service too  Have been + times so thought try somewhere else   big mistake 
negative;booked this on groupon and the photo they used to advertise this restaurant was very misleading as there is no way this restaurant  if thats what you call this more like a buffet carvery  could produce food like that the food was disgusting and bland  i had fish cake which was cooked from frozen my partner had potatoe and leek soup which look like something that came out of your behind  he had steak for main which was tough and the chips frozen  my chicken was horrible it was dry and cold the potatoes was the same and the fruit salad i got was tinned    overall very disapointed would never return here again 
negative; Where do I even start with this I have been to many shows in London  from big west end to smaller independent shows experiences etc  therefore booked this safe in the knowledge that my friend and I generally like and enjoy a huge variety of shows  How very wrong I was  Firstly  this was advertised as  quot Summer time secret cabaret quot  which upon arrival is actually  quot old house dressed to look like it s Halloween  quot  The whole house was decorated in Halloween memorabilia that looked as if it had been purchased from the p store  The  quot Haunted cellar tour quot  was again  a p store decorated room which guests were shown a variety of  quot spooky sights quot   which in reality was an old skeleton and a girl making shadow puppets on the wall  The food we were served was of school dinner quality  I didn t expect five star dining  but I did expect more than a plate of sloppy meaty mush and soggy potatoes  The magicians walking around tables seemed to have got their  quot tricks quot  from the joke shop  I am sure I have found similar tricks in Christmas crackers  The show itself  was again  a shock to see something so bad  when my friend and I are both easily impressed   I feel terrible for giving this such a scathing review  however I don t want anyone to fall into the same trap as I did    each for tickets  an overpriced nightmare that I couldn t have escaped quick enough  If you insist on going to see this shocker for yourselves  do NOT buy the   tickets  get the cheaper ones as you are still seated for dinner    What a disappointment  
negative; Saturday afternoon  Not that busy  Ordered starters and mains and asked for it all to arrive together  Chicken wings arrived  wrong ones   portion of fries arrived  Ribs seemed ok  My burger arrived but not my fries  My partners burger arrived and had to be sent back twice  Onion rings and fries never arrived  Staff helpful and apologetic apart from a message from the chef who was insisting we had had the onion rings  All in all very very disappointing  Didn t pay for the meal  Needs to step up to the mark considering the competition  
negative; service by one waitress terrible she was very very rude indeed after being in there an hour we went to get the carvery of which was appauling cold and of poor quality and choice and the chef was very rude will NEVER ever return terrible place 
negative; Visited this place after a pleasant day out at Greenwich Park and wish I had brought a picnic instead  The staff were abrupt  rude and lazy and possibly the worst family meal we have ever had or ever likely to have as we would never return there    The green tea was awful and in fact I ve had green tea bags that have been better  The food was substandard and bird portions  the spare ribs consisted of spare bone  the seafood soup came in a egg cup size bowl and contained no seafood but something that looked like glue   The main course consisting of noodles was both cold and bland  as for taste I can only say packet noodles have more taste  Also guarded tap water as if their life depended upon it and advised me as I asked for lemon in my water they would be charging for that   To summarise it is overpriced and the food is less than acceptable and unless you enjoy wasting money and being subjected to a completely hostile environment I suggest you walk on by as there are many restaurants nearby and anywhere will be better than there 
negative;This place does not take reservations  However  you will see a MASSIVE Q outside the restaurant  Sometimes the waiting times can be between hr hrs  I simply wonder why   what for First of all I would like to say that this is a huge marketing scam    I was tricked but hopefully you won t so please keep reading    I tried to get a table at this restaurant many times but being hungry and all I never been able to wait for such a long time  One day I was passing by and saw a shorter Q and decided to wait to be seated  After  min wait we were seated   The restaurant is huge and has lots of tables at the lower ground floor   ground floor   first floor too   We were seated at the lower ground floor level  When we stepped in there were only two tables taken  The others   at least   tables plus the bar were all empty  During my  min wait outside in the Q I did not see  people coming out the restaurant making it now empty We were simply shocked but decided to order  We were given the menu and we were told the specials: steak from New Zealand at a ridiculous price  The menu is not really a menu  You don t have choices  Is either meat with lettuce or meat with chips   We ordered  The meat with salad comes  I was simply horrified  Shocked  First presentation is awful  the meat looks disgusting  the taste is Disgusting    I have been ripped off  So the meat I think is boiled or steamed or something and then grilled   looks awful when presented and it s extremely SMALL    The most tiniest pieces of meat I have ever seen in my life in a restaurant  Even the Michelin Star restaurants serve more food    The salad is a quarter of a tiny bit   I left this place hungry and went to Ceconni s Restaurant in Burlington Gardens for more food    Customer Service   Please leave it  Young students serving with no kind of training    I need to ask my manager  I don t know  I will get back to you   This is not a restaurant  Simply a huge scam   That s it  Enjoy if you can    
negative; We went there because we go every time and we stay in Stiffkey and it is the closest shop and me and my brother picked up a book to look at and the man who was behind the counter told us off even though we were being careful  We have decided not to go back even though we used to like it  Watch out for a man with long hair behind the counter  
negative; This is the third time I have eaten here and never again  Why  you ask do you keeping going back  In the hope that it might get better   The service was awful  Staff do not speak English and frankly do not have a clue about service  We waited over an hour to have our order taken but they were quite happy to come back an forth to take drink orders  Is this the plan  Keep everyone waiting and ply them with alcohol to make more money  We had to ask to have the table cleared of empty bottles and when the food arrived it was not worth the extremely long wait  Cold  bland and not as described on the at all  In fact any true blooded italians would have been horrified at what was churned out   I have written to Mr Prezzo to highlight the issues raised  If you want to try Prezzos take a drive to Wimborne where it is so much better  Another world in comparison    If like us  you had bad service then refuse to pay any  service charge  which is automatically put on the bill  We did and they could not refuse to take it off  
negative; Went for my daughters birthday food good but the service was awful had to wait mins for drinks pre ordered food still got it wrong surpossed to get free bottle of champagne never even got offered one spoke to other diners who said the same very disappointed 
negative; Have been coming here for many years and alas no more  Our very mediocre meals were far from what we have usually have  I had plough mans which consisted of  slice of bread from a cut loaf and  packs of warm melted butter  Friends had Tuscan salad with no greenery and no dressing but loads of raw sliced onion we did voice our feelings and were given  quot free coffees quot  but mine did not taste of coffee  We were also plagued by wasps inside the restaurant and although the staff were aware they did nothing to rectify the problem  
negative; Went for a meal but left as we couldn t get in with the wheelchair  this establishment needs to get better access for disabled people  This is an old pub with lots of different levels  but other pubs go the extra mile it would be good if they made the effort to also  
negative; Waited over  hours and still no sign of our food  Called them to ask what was going on for them to say it s not in the restraunt but out for delivery  in the end we had to cancel as we still never received our food  We were starving and wasn t told of any delays  Will never use them again  Poor communication and service  
negative; After being told about the refurbished play area we decided to head down with our  month old toddler for a play and bite to eat  After taking our money for the play area and having a quick look around  we were told that my son was too small to use the climbing frame area and we weren t allowed to accompany him as we were too big  We were told to use the toddler area only   a msq area of nothing but soft play mats and an inaccessible to toddlers  We complained to the manager and were given our money back  I ve never been to a soft play area where parents are not allowed to accompany their children  Ridiculous  It wasn t even busy  there were  other children playing so we weren t in anyone s way  The food was terrible  deep fried rubbish  Totally gone down hill since our last visit and we won t be returning which is a shame as local to us   Hats off the manager on duty though  he was great and very helpful  
negative; Ordered the crab salad and was told they had run out due to Bank Hol  so chose the faggots as a second choice that had also run out so chose Sirlion steak which was tough and I took it home for my dogs  the salt pot had a dirty crack down the side so I asked for it to be changed which they did  Our food took ages to arrive  We ordered a pot of coffee on our arrival and the dirty cups remained on the table throughout our meal  The ladies toilets were out of order  
negative; Today we called to have a meal with our daughters we orded  megga mixed grills   a small mixed grill and a mixed fish meal where do we start When the meals arrived all the sausages had to go back due to them not being cooked inside we was told that they buy them in like that   when the waitress returned with them she stated there you go they looked like they have been on a barbecue and this was in a sarcastic manner Two of the eggs was not cooked properly the egg white was still slightly runny are these bought in like this as well not happy read on My steak was like chewing old shoe leather and full of gristle i had to go to the toilets to spit the food into a tissue as I would not do this in the restaurent The chicken was not cooked correctly this looked like it had been cooked in a microwave and it had never seen a griddle pan   Ladies toilets there was a small pile of wet toilet paper thrown on the floor but other than that they was clean   Shame about the food we was going to have a pudding when we walked in but with the disaster with the main course we would not spend anymore money here we will never return again even for a drink  
negative; Talk about slow  could have done with my sleeping and and a change of clothes it took that long  Our table was booked for : for  people  we had to ask to give our order at : only to be told they were too busy  Food finally arrived at :  Then to my horror my  year olds burger was served almost raw    On top of this the place was freezing  Needless to say I don t think we will be returning to this restaurant again   On a positive note I have to say the guy that served us was very attentive and clearly overworked  
negative; It took  minutes to get seated  We got a first plate of meat after ordering our food  but the waitor did not even ask what we wanted   they just brought out a platter of various cuttings  Our drinks arrived after we had finished eating the first platter  We then had to ask  different members of staff to bring us more meat  we got it about an   minutes after  In total we spent  hours in the restaurant with only  plates of meat served  The staff spoke very little english and kept saying it was too busy to serve us  The place is seriously over priced with no discount for children and   a pint of orange juice  I wont be eating here again and definitely recommend you stay away 
negative; Well    I hate to give bad reviews but this really took the biscuit    I qued for some time before the young man behind the counter saw me  He then slowly walked over and took my order  I gave him  pounds of which I got p change for sausage and chips  He proceeded to give me all the change in ps because he  quot forgot quot  to get change    Fine  so I waited and waited and waited  A woman next to me wanted to order but this guys response was  quot well I dont hace any change so I cant serve you quot   He could have started cooking it    After  mins or so my food was finally ready  I got in the car and drove back to work before I ate them  Well I was so dissapointed  It tasted like the oil hadnt been changed for some time  the chips were under cooked and the sausage was still pink in the middle  Considering the price I paid  I was not impressed    I would never go again  Absolutely awful  The little cafe on the quay is a much better bet  Pasties 
negative; I was really looking forward to visiting this restaurant due to the amazing reviews on TripAdvisor  The menu is varied and can cater to ever taste  so I was really excited before coming  I visited with a friend  and we were pleased to see the prices were cheap  The service was nice  food arrived quickly    However  none of the food stood out to us at all   I didn t enjoy my tofu and fish  it didn t really taste of anything at all and left a greasy taste in my mouth  My friend did not enjoy her fried chicken much   it had more whole chilies on the plate than chicken  Also  there s a sneaky service charge put on the bill so watch out for that  I won t be returning  sadly    
negative;I went for lunch with my friend for my th birthday treat as we had never been before  I ordered the big bird burger which is a burger with roast chicken  The chicken was stone cold out the fridge on a hot burger  By the time I got home I spent the rest of my birthday with my head down the pan  Go at your own risk 
negative; My experience at this restaurant was not a happy one  The barman was cordial  However  the hostess waitress was less than friendly  appeared harassed and did not give service that is normally expected in a restaurant  Left me feeling let down  Wouldn t want to be treated like that again  especially when I am paying for it   Could not recommend this restaurant  The food was mediocre  nothing more  
negative; I felt so awful  Me and my brother went to that cafe and ordered a pot of tea and asked for extra cup  but women stated that I can only take one cup if I am buying one pot of tea   so we bought one  Then I asked if I can pay by card  and women said  no  Cash only   why do you need to pay with card for pot of tea    it s only     quot  what is worse her colleague giggled  I said it s just the way I used to pay for everything these days  Afterwards  we paid with our last cash  She gave me tray with tea and milk and didn t even look at my eyes   seriously worst service I ever had  We wanted to enjoy our tea  but instead it ruined the whole tea drinking experience    
negative;I took  American friends from Texas here for a cooked meal and it was absolutely terrible  I was embarrassed  I have never eaten there before and I wont eat there ever again 
negative; Absolutely dreadful in every way and the worst pizza I have ever had and the place was just dirty  We struggle in Windermere to find anywhere good although the Chinese was ok 
negative; The food is alright  The one dish that I loved  spicy cheesy penne pasta with chicken  has now been taken off the menu  We ve given them a few chances    but this last time  we agreed that we would never return  The service is just absolutely awful  The staff does not work as a team  Even if our waitress doesn t ever come around to check on our meal  refill our drink glasses  or take away empty plates    certainly the numerous other waiters and waitresses who glanced our way should learn to help out and take care of paying customers  It is also dimly lit and loud  when busy    why is it busy    so it makes it hard to chat with people sitting at your booth  If you want a nice meal before or after watching a film nearby  check out Chiquito and Bella Italia  
negative; Ill keep this short  the staff are rude  really unfriendly  You get served quick agreed  I rather be kept waiting a tad longer then the food u get served up  U can hear the owner scream at the workers etc    o place could do with a deep clean 
negative; Waited over an hour for food  bar maid was TERRIBLE and VERY rude  If this pub wanted to get anywhere  they d have to get rid of her  Chef obviously doesn t know how to cook  food was definately NOT worth the wait  Was terrible  I wouldn t even feed it to a dog  I advise you NOT to eat here  
negative; Me and my partner went to this restaurant for a drink and a breakfast  We waited for our food  and when it came out it was like eating a rubber egg  the bacon was so over do it was very burnt  the beans was also over done  the mushroom you couldn t cut it to eat it  the toast was burnt  the tomatoe was burnt as well  the only thing that we could eat from our breakfasts was the hash browns  Oh yes  even the perculated coffee the first two cups was hot   But the second two was very cold after only  minute  The time it took him from the bar to put the sugar in both cups of coffee and bring them upstairs to where we were sat out side the kitchen they was both stone cold  The two weeks before that we went in and ordered two drinks and two mixed grills they was lovely  My partners a chef so he should know what he s talking about  Come on The Miles Thompson in Kendal  Get chef s that know how too cook from fresh  So  all the food will be cooked properley and no one will complain  
negative; I do not know how rude the staff and Manager are  as it was like the Marie Celest  when I went with a neighbour  and it took about ten minutes to get served   they were not busy it was about  pm  The small bar has been spoilt  by putting a pool table in it  not many places to sit down The toilets smell and so does the corridor to the toilets  I do not know why the Brewery don t sack the Manager and refurfbish the Marine though out  I would not go there if it was the last Pub in England    discusted of Hornsea   JW  
negative; I couldnt believe it   i have ordered from these guys many times   been to eat in their restaurant   today my delivery came   the food was cold   tasteless   Very poor   I spent  Please sort it out mem Saab 
negative;We went in for lunch and bought  bowls of pasta   the portions are ridiculous    for a huge plate with about  spoons of seafood pasta in it   the sauce was just a tin of chopped tomatoes mixed with taglietelle   very bland an dissapointing    meals and  drinks left hungry and will not be returning 
negative; I bought fish and chips for dinner and we were disappointed to say the least  The fish was tasteless and overpriced  To add insult to injury  i was shouted at by a short man with greyish hair whilst waiting for my order  Horrid experience  Terrible service  
negative;what an unbelievably horrible meal was served to me last night at The Moorhen Firstly there was a  minute wait for service and the tables chairs bar etc felt sticky and unpleasant When the food finally arrived it was cold and the cutlery was dirty Goodness knows what ingredients were used to make the cheese onion and potato pie It was a gloopy mess of over cooked staleness with a sort of Ryvita looking  quot pastry quot  on the top which tasted like cardboard The profiteroles were stale and filled with artificial cream and NO chocolate What little chocolate sauce there was had been dribbled around the rim of the dish to make it look classy but it was impossible to scrape up enough to eat A simple cup of tea was disgusting like pond water  Surely they can boil a kettle There were also hordes of children running around knocking my chair I shall never return 
negative;I live near Blackpool   most of my family live Manchester so for my hubby s th I booked the red hot buffet as a surprise  family and friends waiting and spending my daughter in law took helium balloons down in the morning and ask if they could put them on the table as I was coming from Blackpool with the party boy   There answer we don t decorate tables   quot   We only ask for a few balloons to be sat on the table  Then when we got sat down and ordered drinks we wanted separate bills being so many of us the bar was literally next to our table we were told we would have to use the downstairs bar so again  of us trailing up and down for drinks very disappointed and will never use the place again totally spoilt the night
negative; Left restaurant with eyes streaming as the chefs burnt the pizzas which left the restaurant full of smoke which was extremely uncomfortable and the extractor didn t work properly  It was only after asking them to put the extractor on that they decided to open the door to get some air into the restaurant  My eyes were streaming for the rest of the afternoon  very unpleasant  To add to the uncomfortable atmosphere  if you like a chicken caesar salad without any chicken in it then you will enjoy it but extremely mean with the chicken  I found maybe  pieces in the entire salad   Overall a very unpleasant experience never to be repeated  P s  They need to equip the restaurant with a new extractor fan and when I spoke to the Supervisor that day he quoted  quot this can happen when the chefs cook a lot of food quot   
negative; We have had lunch here every year whilst visiting Bath and arrived at  today  Usually there is a queue but the staff in the past have given an indication of waiting time thus giving one the choice of whether to wait for a table to become available   There was no queue today but several empty  dirty tables  The male waiter ignored us  times as he attended other tables and when we managed to ask if we could book a table curtly replied  no    I would have left at this point but my husband waited to ask a female waitress who  in an equally blunt reply  said  reservations only for the next  minutes   No apologies  no offer of waiting  no manners at all  A couple who had arrived behind us heard this shockingly rude exchange and left the building too   Avoid this place like the plague unless you wish to be insulted by the rudest staff in Bath  
negative; Went to this restaurant after a Jack the Ripper Tour  A booking has been made as there was a lot of us  When we arrived the restaurant was full our table was not ready  After approx wait of  or  minutes we were shepherded into the restaurant next door which was stated to be the expansion of Aladin restaurant  we went downstairs to our tables  The staff were just cleaning the tables and sweeping the dirt from the tables onto the floor  There was a bag of rubbish under my table which I brought to the staffs attention this was removed  There cutlery was unceremoniously dumped on the table in a pile  We set our own table  First impressions leave a lasting impression  My starter of Pawn Puri was OK  not the best but edible  My  companions found their Prawn Puri awful  I do not know why theirs tasted different to mine  The main course was absolutely atrocious  This course was eating an unenjoyable desert  We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala balti  It was very very very sweet It tested like a simple syrup  It was so sweet you could not taste the other ingredients  We also had Spinach and Paneer as a side dish  This was also very very sweet  We had to leave the food as it really was inedible  If we had continued to eat it we would probably have ended up needing insullin  We paid the bill as we were part of a large group and did not want to create a bad atmosphere but honestly I would never go to this restaurant again not even if the meal was free  My companions feel the same  This was not an enjoyable experience and having eaten out very often this is the worst restaurant I have ever been to  It does make me wander about the previous reviews  This restaurant did not make me as a customer feel valued or welcome  Others may have had a good experience but this experience was so bad that I cannot face indian food for some time to come  Sorry but I am telling you as it is  
negative;Went for dinner last night as it has outdoor seating  it s pretty hot recently  and thought it looked nice  We ve moved into the area not long ago   Regret going here a lot   First observation while waiting for someone to get our drinks order: the waiters were clueless and walked around with peoples food  they didn t know who ordered what  Even tried to give us someone else s food a couple of times   Gave our drink order eventually  it took a while  the lady that was  quot hosting quot  and taking orders seemed particularity all over the place and didn t seem to pay proper attention  as you will see I think she d rather have been sitting with her feet up inside   We got out main meal  we both ordered pizza   however they didn t include the mentioned Rocket on top of my mushroom pizza  Plus we had no cutlery or napkins  The waiter didn t seem to notice this or even care and wandered off  I had to ask about  times for napkins and a couple of times for pepper   I mentioned that I had no rocket on my pizza  which the  quot hostess quot  went off to check and then as I was right  took my pizza back to the kitchen to add rocket  I wish I had never asked   The Rocket was wilted and looked really old  Some of it was mashed up  like when salad gets old and squashed in a bag    The mushrooms seemed half cooked and slimy and the whole meal was just sloppily put together and not made with care at all  Plus I think it was cooked so quickly  the outside looked done  but the pizza base seemed doughy inside   Oh and THEY FORGOT to put our Starter order in  Not that they would have noticed   We will never go there  never recommend this  quot restaurant quot  which is a farce for so called  quot Italian quot  food   It s just honestly awful  save your money and go elsewhere  I really hate paying for bad food and service and today am kicking my self I didn t create more of a fuss  but that s my bad   You have been warned 
negative; Restaurant decor lovely  music nice  Staff very friendly  However  food awful  My partner and I ordered meatballs in a tomato sauce  spring rolls  chorizo  potatoes and paella  All of which where tasteless  bland  over cooked  I cook paella on a regualr basis and can cook better food  The paella was the worst I have ever had  Also  the drinks were over priced  we ordered  bacardis and diet coke and one beer =   I would not recommend So Salsa in Crosby and will NOT be returning there and would not recommend this restuarant   Safe your money  or go to the best tapas restuarant  which is STILL  quot La Tasca quot  in Liverpool  It is a shame  as I like to support local shops and restuarants normally  but will have to go to Liverpool to have a nice tapas  
negative; My work friends booked a table for  of us for what was to be my leaving doo  table booked over the telephone over  weeks beforehand   never during the making of the reservation were we advised that we had to pay a deposit  had it been  we would ve took the deposit straight to the restaurant as it is in the same town  we arrived for our reservation at  pm  looking forward to sampling the food after hearing good reports  some of us had even been to restaurant before  on giving our name to the waiter at the door   he looked in the book   then told us we didn t have a table    What of the  of us were present when the booking was made   eventually another waiter came over   looked in the book  then turned to us   said in a very abrupt manner  quot you DID have a table but we gave it away because you haven t paid a deposit  quot  his customer service skills were what I can only describe as extinct   he was so rude   tried to tell us that they had rang our shop telephone number  times to ask for a deposit    I DON T think so    We are a business in the same town   have to answer the phone to conduct our business  So I find this hard to believe  Now working in a customer service role ourselves  we appreciate that sometimes wires get crossed   but it was the attitude of the waiter    how he spoke to us   he was rude  arrogant   condescending  no apology or  quot wait in the bar area  get a drink   we will see what we can do quot  my feeling is that this restaurant has gotten too big for its boots   doesn t feel the need to give good service as they are always so busy    manners cost nothing  I am so disappointed as you would think local businesses would support   respect each other    the attitude we were greeted with was appalling   unnecessary   totally spoilt our night  As a group of  respectable adults we were spoken to like naughty children by this obnoxious young man now wouldn t want to give the restaurant any business  but as he said to us   he doesn t care what we think or say   no attempt was made to rectify the misunderstanding  we even asked if we were to wait how long did he think it d be before we could get a tablet to which he replied  quot not a chance  all these people are waiting before you  quot  what a great asset to the restaurant    I think not  If this is how you treat your customers then you don t deserve to be so busy   I am so appalled  upset   disappointed with this establishment    
negative; The Black Horse has always been one of my favourite places to eat  A couple of years ago I had one of the best meals I ve ever eaten there   On th May this year   of our family dined at The Black Horse to celebrate my Dad s birthday and also his recovery from cancer  Unfortunately  what should have been a happy occasion was ruined by extremely poor service   couldn t care less  attitude from staff  below par food and ridiculously over inflated prices   We waited half an hour for a waiter to take our order and in the end one of our party had to go and find him  The  mains  took a further  minutes to arrive  we had to then find another member of staff to clear our plates and take our dessert order  which then took another half hour to arrive   Although the desserts were delicious  the  mains  were nothing to write home about and I struggled to work out how a bowl of pasta in chopped tomatoes with a couple of bits of goats cheese on top could be worth the best part of    One of our drinks never arrived and when informed of this the girl at the bar s attitude was basically  what do you want me to do about it    No apology  nothing   The worst thing of all was my nephew s dessert  He had been extremely excited about his chocolate ice cream  unfortunately when it arrived it was basically just a dessert spoon full of ice cream in the bottom of the bowl  He was extremely disappointed and upset   Very very poor  
negative; Staff were useless got orders mixed up waited ages for waitress to take our orders then she got them wrong really small portions six of us went for my birthday really overpriced   which included    service charge  the only good thing about it was the view from our table of the harbour 
negative; The service was very bad  we asked for a knife  and the waitress said : quot  why do you need a knife  the meet is chopped into small pieces already  quot  I still insisted that I needed a knife and I was told that they did not have any knife   The food was awful  bad taste  and over priced of us  we had one very small portion of starter  main meal for each person and the bill was over  pounds  We could go to any chinese take away in the UK  paying  pounds and having double amount  more tasty food Definitely Avoid  worst chinese food I ever tried and one of the waitresses was extremely rude 
negative; after being recommended this by a friend I booked a table to Valentine s Day Dinner  The first impression wasn t great  place was loud and overcrowded  nowhere near the Valentine s intimate atmosphere you expect  Tables were so close together we heard other peoples conversations and felt like sitting in a fast food place  We didn t managed to eat there as after waiting for  min and none attending to take our drink orders we just left  People sitting next to us said  quot  we don t blame you quot  and we found out they were very disappointed with the service as well  If the restaurant takes booking on Valentine s day  have a set menu you would expect them to hire more staff  One person was taking orders  while the other was one clearing tables   Sorry Casanova  we won t be returning  first impression count and you have simply ruined our Valentine s day dinner  Shame as its you who lost out not us    My advice is   count on quality not quantity  
negative; Went with my boyfriend for his bday and after being seated  we waited about  minutes for the first waiter to ask if we would like some drinks  There were only a handful of people in the place but all the staff seemed very busy  We then waited another  minutes to be served but decided to walk out and leave  We went next door to the Handmade Burger Co and had big juicy burgers :  
negative; Visited early evening  The place was so dark you could not see your food   I asked for my burger to be extra well done but when we were served I was told that all the burgers were well done  She did not want to listen to me when I said I wanted by burger to be extra well done and I was told it was law to have them thoroughly cooked through   I appreciate this but was hitting a brick wall so gave up   the burger tasted awful  The chips were double cooked or old and greasy and either way they tasted pretty bad too  If they cannot cook to order then they should have pointed this out when we first ordered  
negative; I have eaten here three times this year and have been disappointed on every visit  Last night we decided to try the dinner and film offer  We arrived approximately two hours before the film started which it seems wasn t long enough to be served three courses from a simple set menu  It was down to us to chase where our starters had got to  free drinks were offered and accepted as an apology  We were then served lukewarm  overcooked chicken pasta bakes and better still  our desserts were served to us in the darkness of the cinema  you try eating a brownie with ice cream sliding around a plate in the dark   because we were now holding up the showing of the film  This prompted many of the other diners to clap their hands when we were last to arrive for the showing although it wasn t our fault  There were  people working in the kitchen on an evening that must have had + diners in it  It s a great set up but so  so poorly executed with mediocre food  Don t go there  
negative; Saw the reviews in here and sounded brilliant so I wanted to give this place a go  other half wanted to visit the Thai restaurant next door as we had been there before and was delicious  But I love to try new places so dragged him into Sakuna  Initial thoughts were promising  busy  lively and quick service for drinks  When it came to ordering they were not very accommodating    The other half is a vegetarian and I enjoy veggie food I will eat and try anything  They have a sesame tofu dish on the vegetarian set meal that isn t on the starter menu  the waitress said we were not allowed to have this dish as it is only for the set meal  Why have it on a menu if we re not allowed to order it  We were then limited to  vegetarian starters on their menu   yawn  we then ordered two tofu dishes to which the waitress came out and said they only have enough tofu for one dish  So she recommended we have a little bit of tofu in each dish and they will bulk up with vegetables   That s fine  cool  But when the dishes came out they were pathetic   pieces of tofu on each ate with a few bits of vegetables  We were charged full price and i walked out feeling disappointed that we had such a rubbish meal  Definitely will not return as options are limited and they are not accommodating  
negative; Came to this restaurant for my friends birthday  amazing decor and cool place to go to but the food was terrible  i ordered the burger medium rare  it came very very rare and that s not the worst of it  it was freezing  I didn t want to complain but after my friend tried it she said to return it immediately i did and they took forever to just  heat up the plate   My other friend ordered the ribeye and asked for it rare it came medium wellcooked it was horrendous and asked for another this came quickly however the waiters weren t apologetic or trying to offer anything else  I think if your food comes out wrong you should be offered a discount but nothing   they were probably used to it  My friends had all finished their food and i hadn t even started and then tried to rush us out and i hadn t even had my food   Would definitely not be returning  
negative; I booked beach blanket Babylon for my boyfriends birthday as a surprise  We were coming from another part of London so we re in a slight rush  I rang to resteraunt to say we would be  or  minutes late could they secure our table as I had requested the nicest one on account of it being his birthday  The woman said yes that s fine  we keep the table for  minutes  We got to the resteraunt about  minutes late to find our table had been given away and we had been disregarded and sat on a tiny table of two right away from everyone else  It was very dissapointing  I was unhappy because we arrived before the  minutes and our table was still given away  The woman told us this was the ONLY available table of the whole resteraunt now  so when she left I asked a man  he told me I could sit wherever I liked so I don t under stand why she lied  She then avoided all eye contact with us all night and didn t come over to the table even when we were waiting to order for a while etc  We ordered tuna steak and rib eye steak  The rib eye was asked to be cooked medium well but it came out bloody and rare  The waiter we had was very nice but I m afraid the mishap at the beginning ruined the birthday surprise and didn t make it very special after all of the hassle  I will not ever be returning  sorry 
negative; So noisy everyone had to shout to hear the person next to them  Awful food   sloppy  overcooked  didnt taste fresh  greasy rubbish  Waiters rushed off their feet  forgot orders  We were served about  meze dishes but there were no serving spoons   waiter looked surprised when we asked for some and produced  and a teaspoon  All very amateurish  Staff were nice but looked stressed out  
negative; These guys dont inform people about cancellation fees anywhere in their website  or booking website  quot bookatable quot  or even on the phone when they take your details  The lady actually told me  I quote  quot Don t worry  we won t charge you quot  when she was confirming my booking  However  even I cancelled my booking on their website  no fee appeared after confirming the cancellation  the next day I got charged of GBP  When I called them received a monotonic voice saying that usually we always charge people who cancel and usually we inform people about the fees  Couldn t get anything from them  Book it unless you sure you will get there  
negative;Not recommended Empty restaurant with bland food and very poor service  Ok for take away but there are much better Chinese out there 
negative; Ordered food to be delivered  Been told food will be with us in next minutes  After hour i called and been told order is on its way  After  mins my partner called and green chilli phone assistant said same   quot Food is on its way quot  partner told him that we are waiting over twice a deliver time abd we dont    phone was switched off    Shop assistant finished call with us  SO RUDE NEVER EVER GOING TO ORDER THERE AGAIN    AND WE ARE LOCAL    WE ARE DISCUSSED and so disappointed Terrible he should be fired 
negative; Very disappointing we like to support local businesses the st couple of times we used this place the order arrived with items missing or incorrect Food itself was medioca very small amount of sauce with duck pancakes but on wintery evenings it was quite good to have a delivery and not have to turn the family out in the cold to collect We rang tonight and have waited for an hour and ten minutes so rang to see where on earth our order was and was told they were busy and the order hadn t left and there was nothing they could do about it When I originally ordered I asked them how long it would be as we could easily collect and I was told up to an hour but probably sooner so was happy with that got really frustrated and not happy as it started getting longer cancelled the order Husband went out to get some food and the order turned up crazy  Can t stand unreliable people would have rathered being told it was going to take that long or even for them to ring us and tell us its been delayed but hungry child and husband is not good  In my opinion there are lots of Chinese takeaways around this would be my last choice now won t be going here again  
negative; Visited for a few drinks on th Jan   The smoking area was covered with spit on the floor  like someone had stood there spitting constantly for a week  it was disgusting  Perhaps a sign to say  no spitting or barred   The worse thing was that when we ordered our first  pints of lager at the bar  the barman was pouring the first pint and shaking the glass to and fro so hard that it smashed to pieces  then picked up the other pint glass  which was underneath this glass that had smashed to pieces  and began pouring the pint  There was a great big piece of glass in the bottom of the pint from where the other had smashed  and my boyfriend thought  he surely isnt going to try to give me this drink   sure enough when he handed the pint over to my boyfriend  my boyfiend told him there was glass in the bottom  the barman looked hard into the bottom of the glass and says  oh yeah  and poured another  as if it was no big deal  Ridiculous  This should be a nice pub its in a nice area  Such a shame  
negative; Went in on a relatively deserted Sunday evening we were pounced upon to see if we d like a table  which we did   requested a highchair   minutes later a filthy highchair was plonked down and he waitress scuttled off   minutes later with no sign of anybody coming to even take a drinks order let alone dare I request for a clean highchair one that I d be happy or my on to sit in let alone eat his inner from  it was clear this wasn t the restaurant for us so we walked out  Very disappointed  
negative;The only thing good about the long boat is venue right on the beach  Staff don t even try to accommodate the customer  Would not even froth up some hot milk for my  year old grandson to try and make a baby chino  My grandson was really upset 
negative;We went to the Gants Hill branch with All friends and family   I have never been so Humiliated   the waiter kept discussing the bill and cost of the meal with me through out the meal in front of my guests   The food was served on an as and when they could be bothered basis  If you asked fro any thing they did not respond until you went up and insisted   The management Really need to get a professional manger in to sort out the service  the food did not arrive together and when it did we got the curries and not Nan and when we got Nan there was no curry left to eat    My guests gave up and probably eat at home   it was horrible  Do Go there unless you want to suffer 
negative; Last night we went in   pm   for the first time ever  it was crowded  No one attended to us  We spotted a waiter who was pouring bubbly into a glass quite slowly  fair enough   We  two lovely ladies  patiently waited till he had finished  then he turned to one side and I understood it as a sign that I might be allowed to talk to him  I was wrong  Because as soon as I asked if a table was free he barked at me with a relatively angry face  can t you wait until I finished serving   I hadn t realised that he maybe just stood to one side thinking we just wanted to walk past him  I then turned to a member of staff behind the bar who said he will check downstairs if something was free  So we waited  In the meantime grumpy angry face spoke to us saying  still in a very unpleasant manner and facial expression   There is nothing free now  but if you come in half an hour    Why would we do that at  pm  Wander the streets of Leeds and then try to get into FRRRRIENDS of HAM because we are some kind of desperate FRIENDS OF HAM groupies  Anyway  I thanked grumpy face and his colleague told us there was a table free downstairs  I did tell his colleague that angry face was going to send us away and that he was grumpy  He didn t reply   he looked a bit scared  Not sure if of me or of grumpy face  Maybe grumpy face has a reputation  Maybe grumpy face is the owner  The Viogner wine was nice  But it took  mins for two pieces of toast to arrive with the spreadable sausage  Never again  Who do you think you are  PS  Why serve a beautiful Calabrian spicy spreadable sausage on a sad English white toast  Why not choose some vibrant Italian bread  You guessed it  I am from the South of Italy and know my spreadable sausage  
negative;Bad  bad service  Food was poor for a restaurant of this standard 
negative;After reading so many comments on facebook about this place i visited it  Took us ages to get served  Staff members chatting to each other before helping us  Far too expensive fir the poor quality  Ice cream has hardly any taste to it and such small portions  Waffles are disgusting too  I definately think this place is overated and definately wouldnt recommend to anyone  The taff behind the counter were unpleasant too  All in all a total waste of money  
negative;There saws a dead fly sitting on my coleslaw  It looked as if it had just changed from larvae due to it s pale colour  Don t know if this means that there is flies growing in food left out over the weekend or if flies are living and hatching in the kitchen  Either way was thoroughly disgusted  Was given meals for free and asked if i wanted a desert  at that point my stomach was churning so much I couldn t eat anything 
negative; This restaurant is supposed to be classy and the food impeccable given their menu and prices  However  the food fiercely lacked flavour  The  quot pate quot  was tasteless to the point it was inedible and when we were served our mains it gets worse  The pork belly I had ordered was burnt to a crisp  black and dry  The chips we had ordered were pitiful  like a jacket potato had been microwaved and quartered and there was no crispness  It was  for me  a complete let down  And to add insult to injury  my friend vomitted for serveral hours after we got home  I ll be avoiding this place in the future  
negative; Meal was not too bad  not the best but not the worst although looing at other reviews it sounds like i got off lightly in this department  However the ketchup they are pushing as heinz  is % not   Im a heinz lover and know my heinz ketchup   which definitely disappointed me and im pretty sure thats illegal Also the staff  So rude  Went and sat down and noone bothered to come over  When i went to the bar the scruffy waiter looked totally uninterested  and the other guy was so blunt and rude  No customer service whatsoever  Would never go there again and will advise all of my friends to do the same  
negative; Same old look at the rest free pickle tray not    chewy lamb     paying for deco  complained about food argumentative managers intimidating staff felt as low as the food leave this place well alone here today gone tomorrow pity standards slip and then you get all this rubbish on a replay i was off work for  after thanks like times are not had enough stay away   
negative; Food was cold  staff hadn t got a clue on how to wait tables not their fault but lack of training  Menu lacking in choice  and I felt like I was sitting in a canteen as room large with no atmosphere and chair uncomfortable  Won t be going again and would not recommend to others  
negative; Three adults visited today to celebrate a birthday  We had watched the transformation of the old Lion pub and decided to try  What a disappointment  Ok if you don t mind a fry up as your main course  which was cold   The wait for the initial drinks order was a long one and the the wait for the main too  The prices were higher than the meals deserved  Each small addition I e  sauce or chopped nuts were charged as extras  Won t go there again  
negative;We were a table of   we had a taste card  the tapas wasn t very hot  as they brought all the dishes at once  so cleary some were sat waiting for others to be prepared  To be honest its not worth the money  I adore tapas  and the whole social aspect of it  Even with the tastecard discount  it wasn t worth the price of the bill    I would not go again 
negative; Been a loyal customer for many years but not anymore  Ordered a chicken kebab and found a long brown hair in the red cabbage  The owners dealt with this very badly and their customer service was appauling  Won t be ordering from here again  
negative; Well  what a disappointment  We were staying in the sister hotel on the same land and were looking forward to a big slap up meal in this recommended food Fayre pub  The menu is costly but I assured myself that the quality would be superb and quantity too big to handle  How wrong I was   and I didn t want to be  We ordered a starter to share  To be fair I was correct about the quantity  but the quality was poor  We had a prawn and salmon salad  The coleslaw was  off    tasted as though it had been standing in a warm window sill all day   and the salmon was more skin than anything else  Then the mains arrived  I ordered a burger  minus the bun  with cheese and fresh veg  The cheese was like a weird powder  and had not melted on the barely warm burger and the fresh veg was anything but  Shrivelled cold carrots and burned leeks accompanied my burger and my sister s fish cake  The presentation was disastrous  I was not willing to pay over   per head for these inedible dinners  Took them back and to be fair  was given a full refund  Another customer came up to the counter at the same time as me  demanding the same and said he d never come back  Neither will we  We ended up driving down the road to Asda and ate their prawn cocktail in our room  Not bad for    Beats the   for the dogs dinner I had originally paid at the Farmers Arms  
negative;We started our evening at the Cosy Club with cocktails in the bar  we were stood at the bar for an extremely long time waiting to be served and when we eventually got our cocktails they were so watered down they didn t taste of anything at all   We then went upstairs to our table and the service got even worse  there was a large party in so the entire focus of the staff was on them leaving the rest of us to wait  My friend and I ordered different wines and when they arrived the waitress didn t know which one was which so we had to try and guess ourselves from the look and taste  When the food finally arrived it was awful  my husband s dish looked more like a child s portion and the mash was bland and tasteless  My meal was so oily I could only eat half as it was making me feel sick    As we were still quite hungry we decided to look at the dessert menu but were told the only dessert we all wanted had just sold out so we decided to just get another drink instead  My husband and I wanted the same spirit so we ordered  but it arrived as a double so they had to go and get another one and once again it was so watery you couldn t taste anything else   Overall our whole experience was very poor and we will definitely not be returning 
negative; As it was a really lovely sunny afternoon we thought we would stop and have a drink in the Attimore garden  It was Thursday and very quite in fact there were only  other people in the garden the first thing I noticed was the ashtrays were all overflowing and as it was warm very smelly certainly if it was late on a Saturday night I could understand this but the bar staff were not busy at all and could have dealt with this it does put you off as we were going to have lunch but I just could not face this we sat there for about an hour and not once did any bar staff come out to check if we were ok or to even clean the overflowing ashtrays i am sad about this as this is my local and has a nice garden but it needs to be  cleaned up this pub has been recently refurbished but the garden has to be cleaned up especially as the nice weather is going to bring out more visitors  
negative; After a long day visiting Birmingham town from London  we were starving and friends finally decided to go with a name that we can all trust   Jamie s   Decided on a variety of starters  the worst one of which was the nachos  If you are wondering how can anyone get nachos wrong  Well  when we complained it was explained to us that they use their pasta to make the nachos  spiral and hard nachos  Seems the pasta that is left over is fried and hey presto   you have nachos  There was a table next to ours  where one of the ladies had the nachos as a main meal and it was sad to see  she left her plate and had to share her friend s meal instead    One of us ordered pasta for the main and guess what   yes  it was the same pasta added to a tomato sauce  It was bland and our complaint seem to fall on deaf ears  so much for customer service  Have tried Jamie s in St Albans and had the seafood platter there  it was simply awful and expensive  Thought would give his restaurants another go   Think Jamie s recipes are amazing  I am a true fan  Such a shame that devotion is lacking in his staff that he trusts to work for him  Jamie  make it pucker  
negative; Food average and very expensive for what it is  F B  TGI and Northampton s own Buddies has NOTHING to worry about  Service however was excellent   great waiter Adrian  polite and courteous throughout  
negative; Waited  hour for starters to arrive  main course was extremely bland and tasteless  Staff mainly looked miserable  and have been left with a delightful upset stomach the day after  Will not be repeating this experience  
negative; We attempted to visit this restaurant for my husbands pre th birthday celebration meal  Having read the concept on the website  we were really excited about having a meal and some cocktails there  We also thought about taking family members in the future    BUT   we had to walk out within minutes   This was down to only  thing   the  female so called  quot hostesses quot   The date was Friday th April  at approx  pm  if the owners Management are reading this    We walked through the main doors and saw  females chatting to each other at the desk near the entrance  They briefly looked at us and then ignored us  They werent busy doing anything work wise  just chatting and being very loud about it    Because they ignored us  we assumed they werent hostesses and walked on   asking a male waiter what to do about getting a table   he told us to go back to hostesses   we said  quot where are they  quot    he then told us they were at the front entrance  So we walked BACK to the front entrance and went up to the hostesses  They starred at us and said nothing  WE had to start the conversation and asked   quot can we please get a table  quot    to which one responded   quot there is nothing for half an hour quot   No  quot sorry quot   no  quot if you re happy to wait half an hour and maybe get a drink in the bar    quot    just an abrupt response as if to say  quot leave us alone  we are busy chatting   how dare you interrupt quot   And that was it  Some hostesses they were  We actually had to interrupt their conversation to ask that question   why should it have been down to us to prize this information from them like blood out of stone    The restaurant didnt seem packed either   We walked out and went to Girraffe  where the staff hosts were the friendliest and most attentative staff i have ever come across   maybe you should send these  quot hostesses quot  there for a meal to learn how to hostess   I didnt enjoy their food however  as we still had a bad taste in our mouths from the experience at the Alchemist a few moments earlier   Disappointed and angry are putting it mildly   we were on a day off from work celebrating my husbands th  Waiting half an hour for a table is not a problem at all  we expected this as we hadnt pre booked  if you are treated like your custom is important and with good customer service    I cant speak for the food as we didnt get that far   but these  girls do not deserve a job when there are people out there that are willing to work hard  They are putting your customers off  I have only joined trip advisor to write this as it made us both so angry   I hope the alchemist can improve on this   I know the bar is new to trinity leeds and things like this can be  quot teething problems quot   But felt compelled to write as you wont be able to improve if these kinds of things are not brought to your attention  
negative; Called this venue weeks before I was due to hold my baby shower here  told by the staff on the phone that they ve catered for many baby showers before so they were happy to accommodate me and my guests for the event which did not have a finish time  When I arrived I was greeted by a rude female member of staff who told me  with a great deal of attitude  that I had to vacate the area by : as they wanted to use it for the restaurant  Midway through opening my presents from the guests  with everyone watching the same rude member of staff interrupted and told us to leave the area  I requested to speak to the manager who was less than apologetic and quite frankly confrontational with placing the blame on me  After spending hundreds of pounds with my many guests buying food and cocktails we were treated so badly I refuse  along with all my guests to every go back to this venue  When moving to another part of the bar  we all noticed the area was vacant for an additional  minutes after we were pushed out  Was there any need for the rude interruption  No  Best part is  they appreciate and welcome feedback  Well my feedback would be  for a  posh venue  as quoted by your bar staff  you might want to educate yourselves with some lessons on customer service  Such a shame as this used to be such a lovely venue  we ve had many birthday functions here before  Looks like myself and all + of my guests will be looking for a better establishment in the future  I urge anyone to avoid this place and take your custom elsewhere 
negative; Read previous reviews  this was an excellent community pub and welcoming to passers by  It had gained a reputation for great food from a varied menu  everyone spoke to you and the regular bands were excellent  I am not adverse to change at all but the new owners have not get it right  The pub whilst it needed work doing has been washed of all character and friendly atmosphere with sole less furniture and a menu that isn t even as good as a chain pub  Don t depend on the pub   we just got bought a pint then got told the pub was closing at  on a Sunday night  Perhaps they should have said before we bought the pint  School report would say  needs improvement    we really hope this pub will get more friendly  welcome dogs properly  get a soul and remember they are in a fantastic area for food and use some of it in the menu and on the bar for drinks  
negative; Been wanting to try this superb restaurant for some time  but never been able to fit us in  Booked  weeks in advance  for my birthday meal  was so looking forward to it  only to be let down  sorry but they are not the best steaks around   The lanlord is very araghant  he is very unprofessional and needs a lesson on how to speak to his staff  The staff welcome you and are very nice  If your not a local then dont bother  Needless to say we will not be visiting again  And its expensive  
negative; Breakfast here was nothing short of disgraceful  The price charged for   portion size    quality of service left us speechless  It was   for  sausage  tiny bacon rasher   half of griddled tomato  small batch o mushrooms and a poached egg that would have bounced off a wall had it been thrown at it  Vile  
negative;  min wait for a dry tasteless burger in a dry crumbly bun  Came with red onion on salad when I d categorically stated that I am unable to eat them  Good food under previous management  Sadly  no longer  Won t be back  
negative; Very disappointing meal  days ago  Seafood food ramen consisted of  prawns in shell some white fish and unidentified fillet   tasteless and boring  Pad tai was sloppy and unappetizing  Subsequently complained by email but manager not interested  Don t waste your money eating there  
negative;Food was poor and the atmosphere was nil  Although it was the Xmas festive period there was not inviting fire lit and poor decorations  A group of rowdy men were swearing in the bar area and  although there were several complaints   one family left because of their behaviour   they were not asked to leave  Waitress came to clear our table before we had finished our meal even though the restaurant was almost empty 
negative; Service was slow by all staff  didn t have any milk so was offering black coffee only and only gave me  pancakes instead of six  fortunately noticed before I left the restaurant  The guy serving though was apologetic and rectified quickly  
negative; Thought we d have lunch at the smugglers retreat today as we ve been there several times and haven t been disappointed  Today was my wedding anniversary a special day  which was totally ruined  The waitress was rude and abrupt  had no customer service skills  The starter we ordered was good  BUT the mains were wrong should of been steak Diane  but came out just steak and my meal came out cold  when they came back they were still wrong they microwaved the steak and covered it with a sauce to cover up their mistake  should of had crispy fried onions and came out with caramelized red onions  when I spoke to the manager he said the chef realised he had done the steak wrong  If he had realised that he should of not sent it out  We were so looking forward to our meals  it was so upsetting and ruined our day  Although the manager tried to apologise but the waitress had just spoilt it and was too late  We paid for our starters and soft drinks  We used our free wine voucher which I feel was wasted because hadn t had our meals for our special day  I left the restaurant in tears  
negative; I would have used a far more expletive word  however  I doubt my review would have been published   We ordered take away green curry with chicken  masaman curry with lamb and coconut rice  The chicken and lamb was tough  as if it had been boiled  and thrown in the sauce just before serving  When we called the restaurant back to say how unsatisfying our meal was they asked that we bring it back  I said it was in the bin and was then accused of trying to get a free meal  The total of our meal cost I can assure you it was not about money more the fact we had paid  in good faith for a meal with was sub standard  After making it quite clear that we would not be going quietly we were offered a % refund which we begrudgingly accepted  Then  about  hours later  we received a call from the restaurant saying they had  inspected  the food and agreed it was not to their  normal high standards   Nearly a week has passed and we re yet to receive our refund so  instead  I am happy to say I have spent    on warning anyone from spending their hard earned cash at Thai Square  Woe betide you if you speak with Jay too  he ll accuse you of all sorts  Maybe he never heard of the saying  quot The customer is always right quot   
negative; After waiting  minutes just to order drinks as the bar staff are too busy at the other side of the bar i finally ordered  drinks  the black sheep pump was being used so i waited at the bar  nothing  they were going to bring it over  nothing  i went back to the bar  nothing  after a  minute wait apparently the black sheep was out so i requested a refund  never received it  The bar was too busy to wait around and the bar staff never came back to me with the refund  Thanks alot hungry horse a  minute visit and unable to provide a drink i just paid you for the extremely bad service  One extra bar staff especially on a saturday afternoon  when theres a kids party on too would have solved the problem  There were  of us queuing for drinks    Sort it out hungry horse 
negative; Am sure the food is lovely but never been able to try it  The menu that you do actually fancy on a hot day is only available to eat outside and the lack of seating renders this impossible  You can either stalk around the poor people lucky enough to get a table or leave  quite frankly  All the empty tables inside  for people who want a full Sunday lunch  only serve to mock all all the more as you sadly make your way to the mediocracy  and eye opening experience of the  Acres   Shame  shame shame  Greyhound  we won t be wasting our time again  Cherry Tree at High Hoyland once again triumphs albeit further than the   mile we have to travel to Greyhound  we know we re sure of a table and delicious food on our Sunday day out 
negative; Arrived by myself for breakfast this morning  first I was told they have no table for  I pointed out at the available tables and then I was allowed to sit  although they made me feel like they did me a favour by allowing that   minutes later I am still waiting for a pot of tea  breakfast of dry blunt scrambled eggs is in front of me  By the time I get my tea it will probably be uneatable waiters walking around the floor  somehow lost and customers calling and waving from all corners  What a disaster of a place this has become  Avoid 
negative; Have eaten here several times and had great food but am sorry to say will never go there again  I had booked for breakfast and arrived early  It was pouring with rain outside and was told that the restaurant didn t open until  am  It would have made all the difference in the world if I had been told nicely that they couldn t serve me until  am but that I was welcome to come inside  So  I went next door to the Sanctum Hotel Soho  was given a warm welcome   stayed for breakfast  Moral of the story is that amazing food will not trump a friendly smile   warm service  
negative; Went there for dinner and it wasn t great  putting in a nicest way possible  Waited on the wine for over  min  dirty wine glasses    Order taken in the most abrupt manner ever    Starter   calamari   was very chewy and no flavour    Waited for that starter to be cleared about  min   Had a fish pie for my main and in pretty sure it s frozen  It was soggy  watery pie with cold middle bit Waited for Maine to be cleared another  min    Finally just asked got the bill  Did not wanted to argue during the service where no one seemed to know what was going on   Sorry I normally would try and approach the subject during after dinner but genuinely no one seemed to care  
negative; Have been to this restaurant previously before it had shut down for a while and found that the food was okay  however on this occasion returning to this restaurant I can honesty say it was horrific  Food  service and raised price   The food was horrible  the TINY pieces of chicken I had were stone cold and hard  most of the food tasted like I was eating left overs from days before  I could go into every other food I tried that was disgusting but I would be here all day   The service was also quite bad  fair enough at a buffet when your finished with your plate the staff take away your plate  Although  I found my plate was taken away quite a few times when I was not finished eating the food on the plate    At our table we had a constant waiter stood right next to our table glaring at us  which was extremely uncomfortable   so when our cutlery was placed down the waiter was straight in there taking our plates away whether we were finished or not   Additionally that same waiter was also quite busy chatting away to another member of staff right next to the table and failed to move when blocking my way back to my table  saying excuse me  a few times  or getting any attention for him to move so I could get back to my table didn t work and I was ignored   All of this  plus the raised cost of the buffet  made this restaurant a horrible experience   I can safely say i will not be returning here and would advise others not to eat here  
negative;Visited for a drink with the possibility of eating  that idea soon went out the window  Tables were cluttered every where  didn t see a table wiped the whole hour we were there  Staff that couldn t have given a Dame  My husband who ordered a pint of cider and was presented with a pint of sludge was questioned when he refused it  they said it must have been a dirty glass  nice comment  Another was poured still the same and they really got the knock when he said he would have another cider as this one was not fit to drink  they even charged him the extra  pence differrnce
negative;If you want to eat very low quality  cheap and unhealthy food   this is should be your choice  Everything comes from a package  tastes like plastic and there is always a big crowd  No offense to the chefs  but working in a place like this does not require gourmet cooking skills  It is an eatery  I feel like being in a barn really lining up for pizza and dry chicken wings  sticky vegetables and desserts which are made out of powder  Food has got the same brown  beige colour   definitely not the kind that anyone who cares a little bit about healthy eating would choose 
negative;Went into this pub at the weekend and there was a horrible smell  Bar was dirty and staff and landlords very unwelcoming  Do not recommend a visit ever again  
negative; Am not usually one for pointing out faults with places but todays experience left us no alternative as we were that disgusted  Refurb from the outside looked lovely  Unfortunately this was very much let down by the diabolical service  confusing areas and general lack of atmosphere  Staff walked past us and ignored us even though we had clearly just walked in and were unsure which way we needed to go  Not even a smile or a quick hello  Some tables were set out for food however as we just wanted a snack we went through to the bar area  Here some people were eating but it wasn t clear whether this was normal as there were no menus in sight  Decided we had better go back into the  eating  room  Sat down at a table and watched  waitresses come backwards   forwards at least  times  Neither of them acknowledged us being there or apologised for the delay or brought a menu which we would expect  Plenty of empty tables so wasn t as if they were rushed off their feet  The room was far too quiet and tables too close together so we felt like we needed to whisper so no one else could hear our conversation So after  minutes we decided to stand up  Whilst putting our coat on a waitress walked past us again and unbelievably still made no comment or any attempt to make us feel welcome  We left and ate elsewhere and is very unlikely we will ever return again  
negative;We went into this empty cafe  as we were hungry and it looked very  sea sidey  once inside  There was a young man who did the cooking and a young blonde waitress  We were met with a smile  We ordered fish and chips and sausage  egg and chips  Basic dinner really  but so was the food  it tasted cheap  wierd egg  a sausage that fell apart  But the worst was the bread  it was served after I had to ask again for it to accompany the dinner  It was brought out and had a large  green mouldy crust on it  Disgusting  I asked for it to be changed  which it was  but we were completely put off our dinners  When I paid  we were offered an apology  but no discount  But  the worse was the young blonde lady  told me that the milk was the same  I said perhaps you should change your suppliers   How awful  and unprofessional  Will not be going back  be warned potential customers 
negative; I have just walked out of this restaurant after what I can only describe as being verbally assaulted by the manager  I suffer from Coeliac disease so I need gluten free food  I was with a party of people the organiser had booked it months ago and had checked with them they could fully cater for a gluten free diet  The  course menu lacked many substantive foods for my allergy to the point I felt I would be eating a fruit starter  Melon  and a fruit desert or yogurt  Neither were they able to provide gluten free pitta bread  which I could have taken with me myself if they hadn t told the organiser they could provide for my needs  The manager rather than hearing my concerns used the broken record technique in absolving herself for any responsibility as a restauranteer for customers dietary needs  and showed no care about my nervousness about her couldn t careless attitude towards my allergies  It was very embarrassing and left me feeling completely traumatised not to mention I had to leave my lovely friends for the night due to being so upset  I warn you not to complain there because as she said to me and I quote  quot I don t care where you complain to  doesn t bother me quot   
negative; The food was adequate and well presented  but less than a week later I can t recall a single dish   it was neither distinctive nor memorable  We are happy to pay these prices for great food  but here the service and each dish colluded to create an overall impression of pretence coupled with a lack of passion  We are still looking for a decent restaurant in Cambridge  
negative; I am new to the area so thought it would be good to try one of the local Italian restaurants  I went with a friend  We walked to the back and waited patiently for a waitress to show us to a table  The woman in question was sullen and made no attempt to be friendly towards us at any point during the evening  Once sitting down my friend asked if we should leave as she had a bad feeling about the place as it looked pretty run down inside we noticed  Unfortunately we decided to stay  We ordered the arancini to share which were greasy and tasteless  For my main course I had lasagne which was spectacularly hot  but again tasteless and presented in a sea of tomato  gravy   Grim  A couple of women then arrived  sat down at a table and within  minutes got up and left saying they were going elsewhere  This spoke volumes  The bill was cheap  but you get what you pay for  Definitely won t be going back unless it s under different ownership  
negative; Okay so  I never leave reviews for anywhere I eat  good or bad  but I had to for this one  I went to this restaurant yesterday around  pm with  of my friends and we just wanted to have a good time and eat out after a long strenuous week of post graduate exams  Now  we got the food which was not so bad but well not so good either  just plain and average and unexciting  I ordered the seafood linguine and it was just    nothing to scream the rooftops about    But my major issue with this dreadful place  and the reason I am leaving a review today is because of how my friends and I were treated  After the meal we had to split the bill and my atm had a hitch and would not go through on their P O S  So we used about five seconds or so to get cash from our purses to pay my bill and this dreadful awful waiter got so rude and blurted out  quot well  let s get to it guys  quot  and then snatched the cash from the table and stormed out  It was the most demoralizing thing I had experienced and it just put such a sour vibe on my friends and I who really just wanted to have a light cheery day  Really wish I knew this waiter s name so I could just put it on here for their managers to see  It s not okay to just treat people like they are crap  I doubt he would have treated us that way if we delayed him by even an hour but we were dressed like business men from Goldman Sachs or something    A five seconds delay in payment did not warrant his awful outburst and it was demeaning and unkind  I obviously had no clue my atm would not work on their P O S machine when it works everywhere else so the tiny delay is not something I could have controlled  And what was more annoying was that it was just such a short time  we literally put our hands into our purses and brought out cash almost immediately so it s not like we  quot delayed quot  him in any meaningful way  I gave him a piece of my mind and he blurted out something he said was an apology but really in actual sense was an attempted justification for his rude outburst and not an apology at all    Needless to say  this soured and spoiled our entire day and we left the restaurant feeling like crap  I will never go to this place in my life again and I recommend you look for other Italian restaurants nearby with better food and better customer service  
negative; We visited the Wellington yesterday and were quite appalled at not only the quality of the meal but the lack of response to our complaint about it  We both had the chips with our meal and to say they were awful is putting it mildly  When we complained about them we were told that they had recently changed their supplier and that they no longer did home made chips  Our complaint was not acknowledged by the Chef  Given this experience we will not be visiting the Wellington again  
negative; After a recent refurbishment  my partner and i decided to have sunday roasts at the Bramford  The tables were so tightly packed together  you banged your legs as you tried to sit down  The meal came within  minutes  It was barely warm enough to eat  The beef gave us jaw ache trying to chew it and the veg was bland  The roast potatoes  all  of them  looked anaemic and barely roasted and the cauliflower cheese looked scarily luminous and was inedible  All we heard the staff do was moan to each other and never asked us how our meal was  probably a good thing as they would not have caught their breath  how annoyed I was   so I definitely will not be returning again  Oh and the wallpaper  decor was almost as bad as the meal  
negative; Firstly I had a high expectation for Rhodes at the Dome having been to the other fancy restaurants in Plymouth such as Choles and River Cottage  However I was hugely disappointed   Firstly we booked a table by the window  we were the table most far away from the window  We then had to share a menu apparently there wasnt enough for a half full restaurant  We then ordered our food having to wait an hour for half a chicken which could have been cooked quicker and better at nandos  My partner had the pork which was lovely but not even enough for a child   The only plus was the chips  I felt sorry for others in the restaurant as the people around us were stilling waiting for their mains by the time we had finished ours  We then thought to order pudding as we were still hungry however this seemed to be a too bigger ask and the menu never appeared   After waiting  Minutes we gave up and used another waitress to pay   There loss of our money  I will not be returning and will pass this information all my friends and family in Plymouth what a waste of time and money this place is 
negative; I really do love this place so much so I got married here but the service is the worst I ve ever experienced in Manchester I waited  minutes at the bar  the guy in the suit jacket not very good at taking orders but he can do a fancy bottle opening trick  Because the wait was so long we opted for the waitress service outside  big mistake  After waiting over  minutes she came back and only got one drink out of the four correct  Not great at all   Reputation is a very fragile thing so I suggest you make a massive improvement  
negative; I have been eating at the White Hart for over  years  always found it a good pub  restaurant  Popped in for a meal in June with a good friend   Lots of flies everywhere had to cover our food while eating it  should have left then  but no we carried on to our misfortune  Yes   food poisoning  I did contact the White Hart leaving them my number to respond to me but they didn t  Its a shame but i will never visit here again  Very poor customer service 
negative; Not a friendly place to watch the game when you are supporting Portugal  The volume was off during our anthem and was turned on once the French anthem started  They also switch off the TV once the game was over not giving the chance to see the trophy handover and all the Portuguese happiness of winning the European championship for the first time ever  You could have put a sign saying   no Portuguese supporters allowed  Shame on you   
negative; Same as last review I bought a voucher and went last night after making a booking on Wednesday and the place is completely shut up so I suspect they have gone bust  Hope I can get my money back from Amazon  
negative; Very disappointing experience  and in total contrast to visits to Zest in its former home   We can only echo some of the other poor reviews Whilst it seems there are plenty of staff the attention to detail and finesse were lacking    Candle not lit  water served luke warm  not informed of soup or fish course and we were served a ridicously large bowl of olives  This was compounded further by unacceptable waiting times for both starters and mains    It was always going to be difficult for the food to compensate for this experience and sadly we felt it fell short of previous experiences   Having found out there s been a change of ownership a new head chef as well as venue we think it needs to find its own identity as it certainly wasn t  relaxed fine dinng    
negative; God it took nearly an hour to be served  Starters came out wrong  Main was cold  Drink was wrong  It took nearly another hour for someone to come and take our payment  It s the most annoying thing  We were seated by the loudest kids imaginable when the whole restaurant was free  Even more annoying  
negative; Went to this restaurant on Fathers Day  The service was dire  portions were so small that it seemed that they d run low on food so were trying to eke it out  When i questioned the waitress that in my main course salad there were  small bits of chicken  half slices of orange and  baby tomatoes  and a handful of wilted leaves  she thought that this was acceptable for  My daughters prawn linguine contained  shrimp sized prawns  Rude waitress  and rip off prices and I will never go there again  
negative; We don t eat our often since having children so were quite exited about heading here for my birthday   Really really disappointed  food was horrible  cold and expensive and staff were incredibly rude  
negative; After okay starters and very substandard mains we were presented with the bill  plus additional  % service charge  We elected to pay this as cash  intending to give less due to the less than stellar service  However  we were then informed  that due to the small print on the bottom of the menu   % service charge was obligatory  Not impressed at all  We paid this very grudgingly  
negative;It had only just opened when we visited but we have never had anything as bad   terrible food   cold chips   very small portion of food   absolute garbage  Never again  
negative; I went to Patisserie Valerie with a friend for lunch  We ordered a soup and a BLT toasted sandwich  tea  coffee and two scones  The drinks were served and after  minutes or so we were told there would be a delay in serving the soup and BLT and asked if we would like our scones first  We waited another  minutes or so for the soup and BLT by which time we had finished our drinks   there was no offer of a complimentary drink to compensate for the long delay  The soup was ok but was served without a spoon or butter for the bread  However  the BLT was served with butter pats on the side  The bacon was undercooked and fatty and the side salad was poor  By the time we received the scones we had been in there for an hour and a half  The staff although pleasant enough seemed completely disorganised   won t be going back anytime soon  
negative;This restaurant is bad and extremely expensive  They rate amazing food accompanied by an amazing view  however the view is only reserved for some tables  we barely had any view  The food was really bad  My starters was so disgusting  they served me deep fried courgettes  huge great things on the plate with grease  so so bad  Our mains were so plain and boring  no taste  no wow factor  A big fat disappointment and money we should have just taken and burnt than gone to this place 
negative; This is a night club next to peoples residential homes  Camden Council should be ashamed  This is not a pub this is a nightclub next to children s bedrooms  I have witnessed drug use  fights  people are in and out all night into the garden right outside children s bedroom windows  sex right outside children s bedroom windows   Camden Council should be ashamed  name it as what it is    a student NIGHTCLUB  
negative; Decided to eat out and as not been for a while chose here  Ordered our mains of Jamaican beef and ribeye steak  beef came served in a metal tray with cold over cooked green beans  meat was dried out and had hardly any sauce  needless to say my partner didn t eat it and he eats anything  also ordered creamy garlic mash which had that much oil on it I poured on my own green beans  Ribeye steak was def not so I was served rump  texture on these steaks is entirely different  Stilton and bacon topper was just fatty lardons and hardly a glimpse of any cheese  All in all best part of the meal was the salad bar which was also not as fresh as it should have been  waitress was good and did give us a free drink after we told her our complaints  We won t be returning  
negative; Absolutely shocking service   Ordered a take away for : to have when my partner got home from work for it to be delivered at :   Called to ask why and complain for them to tell me they were sorry and I would have a fresh order at :   : came and still no sign of fresh order    Cutting this story short now but they decided not to give me a fresh order like they had said they would and in order for me to have a refund they wanted to collect the cold food that I had to get out of the BIN  Prior to all this I was a regular customer    However now NEVER again shall I give them my custom or recommend them to anyone else   
negative; I could not be more disappointed by The Thatch  We booked our table  weeks in advance  this clearly did not matter as when we arrived we were told our table had been given away  We then said to the waiter that this was not on as the year before we didn t get a table at all and he said he would come over and get us a free round of drinks   minutes later our table was ready  we had still not been given the free round of drinks by this point or anything to eat as a small snack   We were a party of  and all of us bar  had an awful meal  The ribs had to be sent back because they were cold and the cheesecake for pudding somehow had the texture of water and grit  All the food comes out to quickly which clearly means that its been sitting on the side in the kitchen and not cooked to order  The puddings are all frozen hence the disgusting texture  We will not be visiting the Thatch ever again due to  years of disappointment   unhappy customers  
negative; Our favourite Thai restaurant  our go to choice for takeaway orders  has fallen down this time  I ordered my usual  red duck curry  which I love  This time  there were only  pieces of duck in the curry   of which were entirely fat  I mean pure  unadulterated  wobbly  blubbery duck fat  No duck meat underneath the fat at all  So I ve just   for  pieces of duck fat and some duck shreds  C mon Rosa s  you can do better  If I was in the restaurant  I would definitely have sent it back   Overall  the portion sizes were smaller than we are used to  What s going on  It gives us the impression that you re cutting corners  
negative;The fresh perk scratchings   were heated up packets   The roast potatoes were not roasted   had not even seen an oven   Amazing location   horrendous dining experience 
negative;My friend and I visited for the first time for lunch last Thursday and were greeted by a dark haired lady  When we said we wanted a table for  placed we were placed in the middle of the room when there were several tables free around the edge with much comfier seating  We asked if we could sit there but she said she had to keep those free as they were for  or  people just in case a larger party came in  I ordered what was described on the menu as a rare roast beef sandwich with root crisps and my friend ordered Welsh rarebit  We had to wait quite a while for the food and the place was not busy by any means with only  other couples in at the time  My  quot rare quot  roast beef sandwich came in a white bread cake which was quite stale and the roast beef was well done  The root crisps came about  minutes after the sandwich which had a measly few bits of green with it  My friend s rarebit was served on very small bits of bread  When the waitress eventually brought the root crisps they had been home cooked but were thick and not properly cooked so were soggy in places  When we finished our meal the waitress asked if everything was alright and I pointed out that the bread was stale and the meat was not rare  She apologised and left the table pointing out my dissatisfaction to the dark haired lady who I presume is the manager or owner  We asked for the bill and they had charged me for the very bad sandwich My friend and I will not be visiting again  Nobody else came into the place during our visit so we could easily have sat at one of the nicer tables 
negative;My mum was over from Dublin and had read a review of The Pantry  she wanted to take me and my husband for lunch  The restaurant manager   no name  balding  dark hair  stoop  surly   was far friendlier to people staying there than to us  No smile  Why is he in the  hospitality  industry  Ambience is awful  staid  boring  The food is well priced  and delicious  The wine list  Why is the least expensive wine so close to    The sommelier and the waiter were delightful  Poor guys  get a job somewhere else 
negative; Only had a caesar salad  came with no parmesan   then had to queue  mins to order dessert and that took  mins to arrive   Shocking service  staff no idea how to manage customer demand in terms of planning  If you stay at holiday inn express  forego the convenience of the porridge pot  find somewhere else  
negative; Very normal fish  overcooked Cod  paid   for a glorious fish and chips without any alcohol  extremely noisy 
negative; Disgusted on the response I got from the girl who I ordered the food from when I called to say they had given me the wrong thing  quot we ll try and get it right next time  quot  Food went straight in the bin  not ate from this takeaway for a while and thought we would try  Definitely won t order again  poor kebabs and cold soggy chips 
negative; I cannot comment on the food as my experience was entirely in respect of waiting  minutes for a table  being seated  waiting much longer  making an order  waiting much much longer and requesting for the order to be cancelled to be advised that I could not do this and being called a b whilst with my  year old daughter  It has taken me sometime to write the review because of feeling intimidated about the service and astonished that such treatment  with the swearing  was afforded in front of a minor and not being able to respond how I really would have liked instead feeling disempowered and walking my daughter away not wanting to subject her to any further inappropriate treatment  I had many a good experience at Las Iguanas Liverpool Street but accompanied with a minor felt Stratford may be more comfortable  The experience was so upsetting that unfortunately I have never returned to any Las Iguanas again but am thankful for this forum now I am empowered to share my views  
negative;we went into both Yates s whilst in Blackpool   and they were both terrible  Messy  unwelcoming   no real ale at all available    it s run off mate  and this was early doors on a Sat   so they planned to cater for a Saturday night without beer  One of them had music so loud it was distorted and hurt our ears  no way could you have held a conversation with the person next to you without texting one another  We had planned to eat here   but decided not to bother and went elsewhere  My advise  give it a wide swerve 
negative;Loved this place for the top notch Carvery  went for many years  always the preffered choice for a nice family meal  great choices always and the staff were lovely  We ventured there on Sunday at  pm to be told food was over an hour wait and no Beef Roasts left   The place was   full and not one table had food  so clearly the  new  kitchen staff cant cope with demand nor supply  We left without ordering and wont be returning anytime soon  What a shame they took away the carvery and replaced the staff with an incompetant service 
negative; one word discusting  Minging food Minging staff  Minging PUB    AVOID  oh and the management don t care that there dogs poo all out back of pub    
negative; Delivery was late  food arrived cold  Both curries had an excess amount of grease which we could not eat  Poor quality 
negative; I have to reiterate other reviewers and my alarm at the extremely poor service at the Graze  I have eaten here before and although the food was average then and the service was slow  I was willing to give it another chance  but this time the service was non existent   My daughter and I and our partners called in before starting a shopping trip in Bath  No one greeted us  so we found our own table  After a good  minutes and no acknowledgment we went to the bar for drinks and helped ourselves to a menu  After a further  minutes at least and still no acknowledgment we went to the bar to order food  There were at least  bar staff plus  members of staff who looked like they might be staff  but it was difficult to tell as they were wearing a shirt and jeans  Despite standing at the bar for a good  minutes our partners were completely ignored  Unbelievable  At this point we left without even finishing our drinks  Will not return  
negative;I ll make this short and sweet   I visited The Drapers Arms a few weeks back  the manageress was so rude I could hardly believe it  Shouting at one of the guests on another table  which left the guest looking rather upset and on the brink of tears   They really don t know what they are doing   The food we had was bland and cold   I would give this place a miss  unless they have replaced the manageress and now bring food out hot and at least relatively on time 
negative;Right let me start off by saying that I lived in Seoul for over a year and ate a great deal of Korean food there  The food we ate in The food was very authentic indeed and tasted exactly like the same food one would order in Korea  The bibimbap was delicious and the bulgogi was very tasty    But This place is an unorganised  baldy run shambles for the following reasons:   They are only open for Lunch  when we went  between  and   We saw over ten groups of people turned away up until when we left at :  Do they not want to make money   The menu contains no explanation of the food whatsoever  If somebody was trying Korean food for the first time  they wouldn t know what to order   No itemised bill  The atmosphere was non existent    Staff were just sat around doing nothing   Which in fact  reminded me very much of most restaurants in Seoul   It was needlessly  grand  and just looks ridiculous  I could go on  but I won t    I really hope the owner is reading this  because I have the following suggestions    Make the place a  in london korean Restaurant  or something similar for Lunch  Turn it into a student and tourist friendly place that serves the food in a quirky way    Put some music on   Clean the toilets   Redesign the menu  Don t turn away paying customers   The owner won t listen though and  as I came to learn during my time in Korea  they won t change a thing  I want to talk you and must cahnge head chef or chef  The mannaza could be a huge money spinner  Korean food is  apparently  the next big thing    I ll probably go back newcastle in a year or so  but I won t go to mannaza  It will have closed down due to the incompetent running of the place    But the food was good 
negative; My husband and I visited fat Buddha for lunch to start off our day out in Newcastle for our anniversary  We absolutely love Durham branch and so was really looking forward to our lunch  About five couples dining so it wasn t busy  Cocktails ordered first whilst deciding our food taken by a waitress who said she would give us some more time to chose our food then seconds later comes a waiter to take our food order so that was a bit random  Waited about  minutes for our drinks then comes the same waiter with random drinks that weren t ours and then the bar staff arrives with our cocktails  Our starters turn up which were absolutely delicious but whilst in the middle of eating the last few bits the waiter takes away    this made me very annoyed as he should have waited till all diners at the table put their cutlery down and actually finish   Then comes our main meals my husbands duck teriyaki was lovely  my meal was not the Thai green chicken curry I had ordered    This chicken curry looked like it had been heated up in the microwave and all I can describe it as it looked like and tasted like Chinese take away food  Tried a bit and it tasked nothing like Thai green chicken curry   so disappointed    caught the waiters attention as no one can to ask if  everything was ok   And he said no its Malaysian curry and so I asked for the curry I ordered  Swiftly took my plate away and within minutes my Thai green chicken curry arrives  Correct order but still disappointed  Looked like takeaway order which looked like it was heated up in microwave  The staff were very apologetic but this didn t help my disappointed  To top everything off when we paid for the bill using the card machine a different waiter attended us and apologised for the mistake but said  well we have three different currys   green and red Thai and Malaysian   but when you order just chicken curry we assume you want typical Malaysian  this topped things off to me insinuating I had just ordered  chicken curry  so I said no I specified Thai green chicken curry  Very disappointing  If you want to go to fat Buddha go to original at Durham or zen at Durham do a lovely lunch menu  We will not be returning to the Newcastle branch  
negative; I have visited this place a few times now and will not be going back  The staff are really rude and the bread for the sandwiches was so thick it made it impossible to eat  
negative; People packed in like cattle  we had booked family of  our table we were told had  quot accidentally quot  been given to another group of people  odd this as we had arrived  minutes before our reservation time and the other group had arrived  minutes after we should have been seated  The other group had not booked   but were known to the bar staff We were eventually seated in the restaurant just inside of the entrance  We did not have to wait very long for our order to be taken  Neither did we have to wait very long for us to be hemed in by a waitress pushing  pushchairs against us   followed a little later with a rd pushchair  this ment we were boxed in on all  sides with my grandson having to eat with his left hand only as there was no room for him to use his right hand  which he had laid on his lap  My son stood up and managed to push  of the pushchairs away  however a waitress came across and asked him not to do this  He explained the obvious inconvenience they were causing to our comfort and ability to use the cutlery  the waitress told us there was nowhere else to put them  My son pointed out that the owners of said pushchairs were not being inconvenienced by their properties  Needless to say we didnot enjoy our food when it was eventually served  The waitresses had to lean over the pushchairs to hand to hand us our food   I cant understand how any owners of an establishment would suggest this as acceptable  My son complained again at the end of our meal  all he got was a shrug of the shoulders   perhaps I would have been able to give a positive review of the food had the dining experience been taken seriously  
negative; Twice since beefeater in yeovil opened we have tried to get in only to be told there is a  minute wait to be seated   Wouldnt mind but only a quarter of the tables were occupied  So many empty tables was very frustrating  Went to Tamborinos instead who though fully booked found us a tables and the services was brilliant  
negative; We have eaten twice at The Walnut Tree  Disappointed each time   You have to order   pay for your food before you receive it  Then you have to order your drink at the bar which is left of the  order your food  then the se person takes your drinks order    Ordered pate for starter   steak medallions for main medium rare    Pate tasted like something out of a cheap supermarket packet and steak medallions were not cooked   Blue   We asked for side plates they arrived as  saucers    dirty   Actual coffee spillage on ring  Disgusting    Would never return visit  
negative; Was really looking forward to going to Lockies Kitchen whilst we were in Romford   The photos on their and James Lock Instagram page look great    Unfortunately we encountered one problem after the other   Arrived on a Saturday morning  waited to be seated but all the staff just kept walking past us  So after a few minutes we spotted a tiny little table in the corner   went   sat down  It is really crammed in there  the tables are on top of each other and it is very very noisy  unbearable    After pondering the menu we made our selection   went up the counter to order  The young lad clearly was paying no attention whatsoever to what I was asking for    times he wrote it down wrong   drinks    breakfasts   then tried to short change me   Forever waiting for our drinks we had to flag down a waitress and ask if we d been forgotten about  Eventually we got them   The  breakfasts came and mine did not look cooked properly  the bacon was still limp   slimey looking   I constantly tried to grab the attention of a waitress who all just looked so stressed   They took it back and must of reheated the whole thing  the poached eggs were hard  It was easier to just eat it and get out instead of sending it back again   The toilets were smelly too   Whilst we were at the place there was a guy standing by the door being generally loud  dont know if he was off duty staff or something  No one tried to quiet him down    A week later I was on James Lock Instagram page and he had posted a photo of a Lockies Kitchen breakfast  one girl put a polite comment saying that she had a bad experience there and actually walked out  Seems she was there the same morning as me   So I commented back to her the experience we had had too   Next time I looked I had been blocked on James Instagram page   and someone else looked the next day and the whole post had been removed   These celebrity hotspots are so promoted to the fans you would think that the service and food would be spot on   All in all I really would not recommend spending your money there or making the trip   I feel sorry for these young fans   I never even got an apology  
negative; The service was slow and unfriendly not one member of staff smiled or said hello   I ordered a Pizza and there was a piece of plastic the size of  pence piece in my cheese from my pizza   I found it I m my mouth  a man said sorry and they haves us  drink free off the bill at the end of the meal  Very disappointing  
negative; Four of us went to eat at OPA OPA on saturday st September  it was a groupon deal that was bought for us as a joint birthday presant  total value  pounds   Although staff were friendly the waiter could not serve us without Mr Tasos  we waited  mins for a drink and the menu  the meze was poor  we had no pitta bread for the hummos and tzatiki  it consisted of  onion ring each   dolmades each the  dips and  other small filo pastry thing  the main course for which we paid an extra  ponds for  as groupon voucher didnt cover it  was a lamb dish was poor not worth the original  pounds something  my husband did not receive his main course as they had accidently brought out his main as a starter portion  he ended up waiting over  hours for his main course which by now we had finished  we left hungry and disapointed  
negative;Key West cafe  Bournemouth Pier  Positive: Nice view  Negatives: Went in  sat at a table  staff milling around doing nothing  Had to go and ask how to order   staff member pointed at the bar and told me I needed to order there  The food on the menu was very expensive so we decided to have a cup of tea   went and ordered  told to wait as they only served those customers who ordered food  Tea was    each so expected a pot of tea for two   no given a mug of tea each and pointed in the direction of the milk and condiments for a mug of tea is far too expensive  We will not be visiting there again 
negative; The horseshoe may have improved its physical appearance yet their staffs poor attitude remains  Their lack of customer service skills is quite simply shocking leaving a bad atmosphere surrounding our meal  After pointing out that the STAFF made a mistake on our bill charging us more than required we were given no apology whatsoever and in fact a particular member of staff was extremely rude  We will not be visiting again  
negative; I wondered how Trading Standards had given this restaurant a  out of  when it s almost unheard of for a chain restaurant to get less than a   Well  when I saw the FILTHY coffee maker  worktops  glasses  spoons on counters and grubby hands of the staff I realised  The food was nowhere near as good as York  please see review of York  and the place had a shabby feel of a slightly sticky Harvester or a TGI  Awful  Would not visit a Cotes again which is a shame because the menu is always enticing    Have you EVER wiped a surface  Birmingham  
negative; Have been there  years running for family birthday meal and really loved it  the beautiful view and atmosphere and the good value food  What s happened   Went again last night  same beautiful view but place half empty  so staff not overworked but sullen  slow and rude  We had to beckon over a waiter to get the dessert menu  he stomped over to our table and said  quot What  quot Unbelievable  Staff more interested in chatting around the bar than serving  our starter dishes plus everything else still on table when we left  What a shame  shan t be going back  
negative; We really did not have a good time at Bill s  We eat out at least once a week  but this is somewhere we just won t go back to  We were seated at a tiny table against the wall  they really pack the covers in here  which I m okay with  it s a business   but the problem is that with two large tables in the way  the waiting stuff just don t get through to you regularly  We waited fifteen minutes for somebody to take a drinks order  and then a good five more for them to arrive  It s not good enough  We ordered a starter to share  and then two mains  For some unfathomable reason  they brought it all together  We asked them to take back our mains so that we could eat our starter  When the mains came back out again  they had clearly just been put under the grill  as the plates were so hot  to make it worse  the waitress didn t warn me and when I moved my plate  got burnt so badly that I had two blisters on the inside of my fingers  After our mains  a bright security light came on inside and shone right in my face  for a good fifteen minutes  Tbh  by that point we were so tense that I m surprised anything could have made us more so   but this did actually manage it  All in all  a dreadful evening  We didn t complain as we re not the complaining sort   but suffice it to say  we ll never eat there again  It s such a pity as the setting is lovely  and nice to go somewhere that s NOT on the waterside  
negative; My husband and I visited Thursday  Nov for lunch the meal was not good we had ribs which we always do when we go harvester but we had so many small pieces every mouthful was awful and also one of the staff was playing with her hair toilets were dirty not been cleaned we waited ages to be served then to be cooked then to pay they certainly do not work as a team I did mention to the staff but of no interest was shown and then I wrote an email they rang but I was unavailable and should have rang the next day but sent email instead I have replied to this and now posted on trip advisor just stay clear of burton restaurant 
negative;The position is poor and staff have taken on more than they can handle  On first views this little Vintags Tea Room looks lovely  s style and decor  The ladies dressed in s style  music of the era playing and bunting outside  There are two small tables outside and overlooking The Headland where the first Bombardments hit the UK this should be a dining experience to enjoy  However  thats where it ends  The sign outside reads   we serve fresh food as fast as we can not fast food   so I patiently waited twenty minutes outside for a small order of water and a panini  I was charged   which included a  p service charge  The wait included the next door fish and chip que locals spitting and swearing as well as many drunk Sunday Afternoon locals  It was only  hrs  After forty five minutes I sent inside to ask if my order was at least on it s way  The reply I got was   sorry  did you not get it  I ll make it up now  it only takes two minutes   and whilst I was inside  the other waitress had cleared my table of my water and the unused utensils and napkin  Obviously I asked for a refund to which I was given Their attitude was one of no customer quality at all so on the surface it looks good but my  minutes only experienced poor quality not only to myself but to others too 
negative; Visited on a Saturday night with my wife and one of my children   yr   Sat at a table with service  We were ignored for  minutes  Got up and left  Took my business elsewhere  No second chance  
negative; Went for a lovely meal to celebrate a belated valentines  however was unaware how long we were going to be there  We ordered our food at the bar o  it was a Monday night with the half price so we knew there would be a bit of a wait  we got told half an hour   Sitting at the table we watched other people enter and order their food    their food came and we were still just sat there   minutes after ordering a waiter came over and told us that they had ran out of chille for the chille con carne  So my boyfriend ordered something else and we got told it was not going to be long  After waiting just over an hour after ordering we finally received our food  It was not great  The burger was tough and dry and the  warm naan bread  was stone cold  We emailed slug and lettuce that night and received a promising email the next day about sorting something out  however this was not the case  After replying we heard nothing back   more emails later and still no reply  they avoided us hoping we would drop it but to be honest it kinda of put a downer on what was meant to be a special night  
negative; where can i start visited this place recently  the staff are very rude unfriendly and the food is dreadful bland and watery shame 
negative; I thought I was eating rats  This place is essentially some guy s shed which had no fridge  although he pretended there was by kneeling below the counter to get our  quot cold drinks quot   which were clearly room temperature   As our pizzas cooked  we looked on nervously as the man wiped his hands in his apron before answering the phone  We then realised he had no sink  The wires were covered in tin foil    the whole situation was a disaster from start to finish  
negative;The bright orange paintwork should have set the alarm bells a ringing and that indescribable smell of fat and yuch should have sent us a running  but no we stayed for possibly the worst dining experience in recent memory   Platitudes in service could not mask the simply appalling food   when you order  bouillabaisse  you at least expect some form of sauce rather than the bowl of dry rice which was set in front of me  The menu promised so much and delivered so little  Seafood which should have been returned from whence it came rather than served to paying guests  dry bread that tasted of yeast and even chips which were hard  undercooked and  according to my colleague  simply disgusting There are lots of devine Belgian beers on the menu and perhaps this is a deliberate attempt to get you so completely and utterly drunk you can t eat  don t want to eat or can t put your finger on what made you puke   If you are looking for somewhere to eat  try anywhere other than here 
negative; I booked this back in June and paid    yes   for four of us to go on a boat trip with bubbly cream tea to see the red arrows display on th August  The online booking was not user friendly  Less than a week before the event no one had contacted me so had to contact them  No one approached us at the quayside so had to find our own way to the boat  only after following a girl wearing picnic cornwall t shirt  The boat was tiny  I was flabbergasted  On the boat were the water taxi owner s  children +  of their friends who had come along to see the red arrows display  There was another couple who were on the picnic cornwall trip and I wonder what they thought about it all   The  scones that we were given were hard and slightly burnt  on a plate with a knife and a paper napkin  Not very elegant  The jam and cream was ok but we all could only eat one scone  The bubbly was sparkling elderflower wine  The red arrows display was amazing  but I can t help thinking we could have had a much better experience on the quayside  I did call in at the shop on our way back to complain but all that happened was the girl who had been with us on the trip wrote down our complaints and said she would pass it on to her manager  No one has ever contacted me  I would not recommend picnic cornwall to anyone  
negative; I have never in my life been spoken to the way staff at tiger bills did  I ordered my food for takeaway delivery to be told   mins waiting time  I only live mins away  over  hours later and  phone calls my food finally arrived  cold and missing items  another phone call later  wanting to speak to the manager  who conveniently wasn t available  I was given a full refund which takes   working days  I will wait to see if it gets credited  Never again  
negative; No one even bothered to acknowledge us so we walked out   enough said Sooo glad we never went there for dinner after reading the reviews   
negative; Oh dear what an experience  We were seated out our table but were not given menus they were just left on the table  We were not asked if we wanted any drinks and had to wait to order these with our meal  When this arrived mine was fine but my husband had ordered sirlion steak and he was pretty sure it was rump Half way through our meal I managed to attract the waitresses attention and asked for more drinks  We had finished our meal and still no drinks  We waited and waited and then decided to ask for the bill  I asked politelyand told the waitress that we had ordered drinks which had not arrived and we did not want them now but would like the bill  She asked the other waitress about the drinks and she got very agressive and said she was busy  We then had our bill dumped on the table and then the older waitress  dark hair with a pony tail  came over with our drinks and again with a terrbile manner said  quot here are your drinks do you want them quot   We decided not to leave a tip and we waited for our change and the older waitress said in a loud voice  quot oh they are waiting for thier change quot   Please dont bother going to this place  there are many restuarants to choose from with far better customer service and better value for money  
negative;customer service was appalling  speak to people like crap and generally didn t care about their job  The staff were rude and talking about customers when they were there 
negative;My partner and I visited a couple of months ago and were bitterly disappointed  the place is poorly laid out and feels like a school canteen  We waited a few minutes to be seated and were just pointed in the right direction to a table  they took our drink orders and left us  After we had been up for a starter we still hadn t had our drink and there wasn t really much else to choose from to have a different plate for a main  We still hadn t had our drinks by the time we were eating a second plate of mediocre  overcooked  cold food so we had to ask again and were treated very rudely by the woman we asked  Desert options looked awful  they were even stingy with the tap water  Will never go again especially as it was about   each 
negative; An Italian restaurant starts with the greeting  continues with authentic friendly service and is topped off with classic Italian dishes  This is a restaurant owned and run by people who clearly are not from Italy and who appear to have never been to an Italian restaurant let alone Italy  The staff are surely poker faced young woman who have no idea how to interact with customers  The food was mushy tasteless and cold and the dishes were confused  This restaurant masquerading as an Italian restaurant is an embarrassment to all Italians and anyone who enjoys Italian ambience and food   
negative; Having read such fantastic reviews we decided to visit this new restaurant  We regularly eat out in all types of eateries but Italian food is our favourite  This  quot Italian quot  restaurant does not boast of the usual friendly welcome that is so familiar with every other Italian restaurant that we have ever visited  The staff were very unfriendly and we were made to feel as if we were being a nuisance just by being seated at the table Music is played too loud to allow for pleasant quiet conversations to take place  The decor is a bit over the top just as the prices are for extremely less than average dishes  Suffice to say tasteless food in a rather tasteless setting  Sorry but we will not be recommending or revisiting this place  
negative; Do not go here to eat  My sisters and I visited the restaurant hoping for a pleasant meal together  We go out  times a year for each of our birthday celebrations  Initial impression was not a good one  A young man attempted to show us to our table on arrival  however the manager interrupted and stopped him telling him off in front of us   it was very embarrassing   Once seated we ordered drinks and relaxed as one should whilst we studied the menu  The menu was not extensive there was around  starters to choose from    of which were salad  Other choices included salami soup and mushrooms  We decided to order  pizzas to share as salad was not what we had in mind and there was very little other choice  Main meal    of us ordered Beef stroganoff served with rice and salad  There was enough I would say to satisfy the appetite of a  to  year old child  this I know having had  daughters   One meal arrived with the salad  leaves  and one without  My sister ordered a pasta meal with chicken which was presented in a small bowl   her views on this meal were presentable but nothing special  Another sister ordered salmon fillet  This was a small piece of salmon  around   x   inches   She was informed that this came with salad  about  leaves   She ordered potatoes and vegetables therefore at a cost of an extra My other sister could not afford this extravagance of eating some vegetables with the sea bass that she ordered and therefore just ordered potatoes   Incidentally  halves of baby potatoes are  Her sea bass arrived   it measured approximately   x   inches and cost My sister feeling that she was being abused with the offering refused to eat it and therefore did not eat  To sum up we were a group of  ladies who had  pizzas   very inadequate meals   bottle of wine and  bears ciders and the bill totalled We refused to pay the service charge and paid    We complained profusely about the standard quantity of the the food  We all left the restaurant feeling like we needed to go out and eat  With so many restaurants who are so happy to provide quality food at a fair price there really in no reason why anyone should choose to eat here   The waiter waitresses were very friendly and polite however and they were clearly trying to do their best in what must be a very demoralising job  
negative; I have been to this eatery three times  The first time without hitch  pure fluke   The second time I found hair in my burrito and the third time  last night  I found a bit of sharp plastic in the ice cream  None of these times  did I get offered a refund  It takes ages for the staff behind the bar to take your order because they are so under staffed  I will never be returning to this hungry horse or any other hungry horse outlet  
negative;Have passed this place many times and decided to give it a go today as it appears to be popular  Wish I hadn t bothered  Six quid later  the majority of it is now in the bin  I asked for something tuna and tomato based  hot  and the lady called upstairs to order it  but said it would take a few minutes  She then said there was other tuna stuff in the chilled cabinet downstairs  but I said  no  don t worry  I ll hold on  but she cancelled the  upstairs order   er  why    and got me this other stuff and charged me   for something that was virtually inedible    Needless to say  I will be passing this place many times again and not going in  Yuk 
negative; Don t understand the concept of over priced meat and fish dished  being served    minutes before side dishes eg chips  potatoes  If you want tapas go to Spain as this was dreadful   Will not return if you want a fantastic meal at a sensible price go to  Squid ink  just around the corner  
negative;Do not waste your money  this has to be the worst Indian food in town and possibly the county   Having been on this planet for  years and sampled many Indian restaurants and takeaways  I didn t think bad Indian food even existed until our experience at The Shagor  Although some Indian food is better than others I have always found it to be the most reliable food to eat in or take away and it was always served up steaming hot  as opposed to spicy   until yesterday   We ve lived in Westcliff just over a year and used to live close to one of the best Indian takeaways in Essex  Hutton Spice  so we know what good Indian food should taste like  We really fancied an Indian last night and  although money is always tight  decided to treat ourselves  We couldn t access the menu on line  decided to walk to The Shagor and arrived just after pm  The place was empty and they clearly weren t busy  only one other person came in to collect pre ordered food during the short time it took us to decide what to order    The food was delivered to our home well within the time we were told it would  a half hour  but this is the only good thing I can say about it  The foil takeaway containers were hot but the food inside wasn t even slightly steaming and was so greasy the oil had spilled over the lids before we even opened them    The Chicken Kashmir sauce wasn t creamy but watery  oily and bland  I know it s supposed to be mild but it was practically tasteless  The chicken pieces were dry and hadn t soaked up any of the sauce as if it had been pre cooked and thrown into the sauce immediately before being put into the container    The Coconut rice we ordered with the Kashmir curry was dry to the touch and taste  possibly because it had way too much coconut in it but more likely because it had been kept hot for hours on end    I ve eaten Tandoori Chicken Biryani and Chicken Tikka Biryani from a number of other Indian restaurants takeaways and always felt I couldn t go wrong with it  The meat is usually marinaded before cooking which gives it a certain amount of colour  succulence and a lot of flavour but the The Shagor s was pale in colour and dry as a bone  The only Chicken Biryani options on the menu were Chicken and Chicken Tikka and  perhaps foolishly  as it s a Tandoori restaurant I assumed the Chicken option would be cooked Tandoori style rather than just cubes of plain  dry chicken  The Biryani rice was also dry and devoid of flavour except for a burning after taste and the accompanying vegetable curry was watery  oily and absolutely tasteless    Even the Peshwari Naan wasn t right  as if it had been undercooked because it was soft and wet rather than crisp on the outside and soft inside like we ve ALWAYS had before    Even though I was incredibly hungry because I hadn t eaten since lunch time I couldn t bring myself to eat any of the food  I gave the chicken from the Biryani to the cat who ate it all  I guess because it was devoid of flavour  cats aren t known for their love of spicy  Indian food    I work in hospitality and recently attended a food safety course where I learned about cooking  food holding and reheating temperatures in order to avoid bacteria increase and food poisoning  So the fact the food arrived luke warm worried me even more now I know it s possible to get horrible food poisoning even from rice  Given the fact that the restaurant is only  minutes walk from our home  it should have arrived a lot hotter than it did  However  I always nuke takeaway in the microwave because  call me old fashioned  I prefer it hot and don t fancy food poisoning    My husband and daughter reluctantly ate a small amount because they were hungry but agreed it had little taste and was the worst curry they d ever had  There was enough food left over to have today but I threw it all away even though it cost just over   which we can ill afford at the best of times  I m not a great lover of them but have had better supermarket microwave curries    The man who appeared to be the restaurant owner was a bit pompous and surprised we hadn t had food from there before because   quot We been here over  years  quot  With any luck  not for much longer if the rather nice looking Indian restaurant recently opened across the street is any good  It was a toss up but we went with The Shagor because it was established  more fool us    We will be visiting the new place next time we fancy a curry which might be some time after yesterday s experience    I was tempted last night to telephone and complain but had a feeling I would be wasting my time and  having read one particular review today  it appears I was right  I would have received a lot of abuse  not even a part refund and  at best  been offered free bread with my next order  which wouldn t be much good to me when I plan never to go there again 
negative; My husband a I dined here on th october  When we walked in we was greated by a very plensent girl who showed us to our set and took our drinks order  We was invited to go up to the beffet to pick our food  The food choice wasn t the best but hey  The chicken and sweet corn soup was horribly sweet  I then decided to have some fried chicken on a stick when I bit into the chicken is was very sponge and a yellow on the inside  I then opted for duck pancakes  but again the duck was full of big lumps of fat  My husband had beef char sui but it wasn t very nice as the sauce had turned to jelly  We will not be returning  
negative; What a shame  A lovely pub in a fabulous location  but let down completely by its rubbish food  A friend and I took our daughters here on Friday for lunch as part of a treat day out for a school inset day  The children s menu  sausage and chips  fish and chips etc  was not wanted as too heavy and filling for a bit sunny lunchtime  So we ordered them a sandwich from the main menu  cheese and ham  but asked to substitute the baguette for sliced bread  I ordered a Caesar salad with chicken and my friend a goats cheese salad  They refused to charge a lesser amount for the sandwiches even though what turned up was a couple of slices of a bog standard sliced loaf   not even fresh bloomer bread  I m sorry but    for this sandwich  a handful of crisps and a couple of soggy lettuce leaves was disgraceful  On top of that  my Caesar salad was nothing but a bowl full of the same soggy lettuce leaves absolutely drowned in dressing with some dried  not fresh  Parmesan sprinkled on the top  If I hadn t paid extra for two tiny pieces of chicken on the top  it would have been just soggy lettuce  The bill for this sorry fare was ludicrously high and needless to say neither my friend or I will be back and it put a dampener on the treat day for our daughters  
negative; Supposed to be the best ice cream parlour in Southport  Awful experience  The parlour consisted of three tables surrounded by large boxes and several containers of bottled water  The menu was disappointing so decided to buy icecream from their kiosk next door  Bought two scoops of ice cream of different flavours which were served in a very unattractive pink receptacle  No wafer  Invited to eat in the parlour  Ice cream tasted stale and difficult to identify the two different flavours  Very disappointed  
negative; My friends and I decided to go to Cosmo as we ve heard very good things about the amazing choices of food on offer    Unfortunately when we went to make our selection at  pm  after being told that all food is refreshed regularly up until  pm  there was only a few choices of dishes left that we re dry to the bone and no sauce  The prawn toast was so hard I nearly broke my tooth biting into it and the Cantonese duck was full of fat and bones   To top our bad experience off   of my friends joined us for the last minutes of our time here  not eating  but brought a bottle of wine from the establishment  as the went to leave and pay for said wine they were then told to pay for the seats at    each  half the price for the food  When I spoke to the duty manager of the establishment he raised his voice at me in a VERY rude way and refused to listen to the paying customer   I wouldn t recommend this disgusting establishment to anyone  
negative; I have always said that the hakka in Plymouth was well worth a visit we went there recently and what a disappointment  It was a Friday night at about   there weren t many staff on but that is the norm and the place was busy with Chinese customers we assumed that that this was a good sign  The staff were as attentive as ever and took our orders  But this was when everything went down hill we waited for our starters and waited finally they arrived  As usual they were delicious  Then we waited for our mains and waited  The table next to us who  were Chinese  and had arrived after us had their starter and were already half way through their mains  By this time we were annoyed and called the waitress over she went to the kitchen and came out with boiled chicken and rice which was stone cold at this stage we decided to leave  We paid for the starters and wine and did ask the waitress why others had been served before us  She apologised and asked us to return to our table but we left  I was up set and disappointed as this was one of my fav restaurants  I think you take pot luck if you go there   
negative;We  like most people  are used to being made to feel a bit special when we are out  From what we saw and experienced at Chiltern Firehouse  they go out of their way to make their  non celebrity  clientele feel most un special  We won t be making a return visit  which is a shame as the food was excellent 
negative; This place needs a good clean  Bad service  Really really bad food that has been left sitting there for days  My boyfriend had a waffle and couldn t cut it it was so hard  Bad coffee  What a Shame  
negative; All food was over priced  how can they charge nearly   for a Prawn Cocktail  which was nothing special  when the mains were served we were very disappointed with the portion size  very small Pasta served with sliced chicken breast  mushrooms and sun dried tomato s was the description on the menu I found two slices of mushroom  one slice of tomato and when I found the sliced chicken breast there were six very small pieces hardly a sliced chicken breast the problem with the food is so little ingredients are used there is no flavour to the food they over do the garlic and herbs to make up for it you could not even taste any chicken or mushroom seriously they must use one chicken breast to do six or seven meals with  The Restaurant itself is poor one half is no to bad but the other half is like thy have taken over a old shop unit and done nothing to it   its quite clear that the family running this Restaurant do not care about the food they serve or the prices they charge as they probably know most customers would not return  Although the restaurant was busy  I cant see how  it must have been with people who like us was their first time or people with more money than sense  all in all everyone in our party left feeling hungry and ripped off and very unhappy  
negative; Having looked at the menu on the website before hand our group of  people was looking forward to eating here  We were on a time limit as we was on our lunch break We had booked the table for pm and on the phone explained that it needs to be ready for when we got there due to time On arrival we had to wait  min as the table was not set When we finally sat down we had to wait another  min for the drinks order to be taken and then quite a while for the food order  They did not have anything off the internet menu as they explained they only do Thali at lunch times The food came out and was very cold and very bland and tastless  The best part of this experience was the restaurant had lovely decor Service was very slow and the waiters had no social skills and didnt even ask if the food was ok   Will not be going back there   
negative; I have no idea why this is rated so highly and why everyone thinks the food  AND SERVICE    were excellent  What can I say    Brits    As most of the users have mentioned  you order on a tablet from your table  which means that for my entire time there the two servers were awkwardly walking around doing nothing  What is the point of ordering on a tablet  The restaurant is tiny   First thing that happened: the tablet has two options  quot order quot  or  quot view menu  quot  I decided I wanted to view the menu before ordering just to check it out  I was looking at the menu and the waitress CAME OVER and was like  quot that s not where you order quot  and exited out of the tablet for me and opened the ordering form  I was like   quot excuse me  I was looking at the menu  quot  She was like  quot Oh    okay  quot  and pulled the menu back up for me  Imagine going into a restaurant and you aren t ready to order yet and the waitress pulls the menu out of your hand and asks you to order  RUDE   Then  I ordered rigatoni pasta with mushrooms and parma in a cream sauce with parmesan cheese on top  They brought me my pasta  no prosciutto  which is expensive    I told them and they fixed it  but what really seemed absentminded to me was that a  the restaurant is very small b  there were two servers wandering around doing nothing  c  the restaurant was nearly empty   only  or  tables including my own  and d  the order had been placed on a tablet by me    there was no room for human error  server s handwriting  forgot to write down when order placed  etc  Then  as she was standing near my table I saw my waitress SNEEZE INTO HER HANDS and then not wash her hands for about five minutes  And she touched the counter of the station where hot food is placed when it s ready to be brought to the table  Unbelievable  I called the manager over and he looked at me as if I was crazy for trying to talk to him  I mentioned it to him and the server noticed  and ran to the open kitchen to wash her hands  His response was  quot she s already doing it  quot  Well no kidding  cause she heard me complain to you  Disgusting   My pasta overall was decent  Menu is short  About as good as any chain restaurant  The cream sauce was as thick as custard and just way too heavy  Not good  Could ve made something better at home  The bread tasted like something I could buy pre sliced at the market   Overall  a huge disappointment and a waste of money  It was over gbp for the pasta and a sparkling water  Try somewhere else  
negative; First and last visit here  Used Groupon deal but still over charged when questioned bill found rice and noodles not included in deal  curry without rice    also over charged on drinks  no prices on bill  Portions much smaller and all food just warm dirty cutlery left on table even though we had collected it togethrer ourselves to be removed   Will stick to Chaophraya from now on   
negative; Today my friend and I visited the cafe in order to enquire after a job advertised in the window  However  the manager was extremely rude to us  and almost had my friend in tears  Not the way you expect to be treated when applying for a job  never mind entering a cafe  We were considering grabbing a bite to eat from the cafe as it smelled delicious  however  after the disgusting way she spoke to us  we will never be returning again  bar to make a subsequent complaint   I don t know about the food   as I say  it smelled delicious  although the prices seem a tad high for an independent food outlet   but the service was almost comically ridiculous and I would suggest that the lovely atmosphere they claim to exude is  faked   hence the rather bad pun in the title of this review  Personally would warn others against making a visit  
negative; This is very busy restaurant with lots of staff but the food was really poor   worst Italian food I ve had  The waitress was very impatient and suggested a starter for me  When it came it was a handful of lettuce  two pieces of artichoke with half a tomato and three olives  No dressing was offered  Then we waited for  minutes for the main course  My husband s pizza base was uncooked  My aubergine bake had two wafer thin slices of aubergine on a bowl of possibly tinned tomatoes  The aubergine was transparent and white  and obviously hadn t been cooked but just microwaved  The expensive mixed salad was another handful of lettuce and a couple of tomato slices  again with no dressing and none offered  The restaurant manager was very angry when I sent the food back  quietly Our hosts at our accommodation said they don t recommend it  wish we d known before    We should have realised that the enormously long menu says  tupperware vats of prepared food and microwave cuisine   Avoid  
negative;Very nice n pretty setting cannot fault the grounds we went for a three night stay but only managed two came home early as we had had enough first of all on the advertising site it stated there was an onsite shop nothing at all not even somewhere to get ur basics  bread milk ect so make sure u go prepared plots for your stay are not marked out well at all they pointed us to our plot and we pitched up where we thought he had said  in my opinion he should have taken us and showed us  for him to come over and ask us to move he showed us some paint on the grass that was barely visible to show pitch numbers after we eventually got settled down we started to enjoy our weekend but it wasn t to be the electric blew on half the site it was off from about  at night until  the next morning this carried on through out the duration of our stay the hook up wires just run around the pitch children could easily tip over them  toilets and showers are rediculous only  toilets in shower block  there is a few porta loo s in all my years of touring I have never come across anything as bad
negative;What a HUGE disappointment this seemingly charming pub was  The bar staff are unable to keep up with customers orders  The bar manager out of control  The overall manager trying to argue before I had finished my complaint  The girl waitresses all very helpful the star being anniek  bar food v limiting unless you are a monkfish lover and fox tail beer watery   but insult on injury was being overcharged for drinks we never ordered   buyer beware 
negative; Gone are the days when it was the best in town  Need to learn from Kingfisher  Won t go back again  Last time couldn t eat the fish it was horrid 
negative; We booked a table in advance  When we arrived we waited around  mins before anyone acknowledged us  eventually we just sat at a free table and waited for someone to come over  Despite trying our hardest to get the waitresses attention it was another  mins or so before we ordered our drinks and food  Some of the food arrived before our drinks  which is always annoying  Food was quite tasty but two of the six dishes we ordered arrived freezing cold  The salmon curry for a maximum of  chunks of fish  was stone cold  I stood up and got a waitresses attention and told her it was cold  she took the dish and microwaved it and brought it back  This meant that we only had half the dish warm as the other cold food was already on our plates  Clearly the large majority of the food was microwaved and not heated through    The food is hugely overpriced  a lot of the dishes are charged at a comparable price to a local restaurant sized main course  but here they are about   of the size   At no point did anyone ask if we were enjoying our meal and we were charged in full for the cold food  The waiting staff were too busy chatting to each other or leaning against the wall at the back of the restaurant staring into space to help    Will avoid going again and dissuade friends and family from going too  
negative; Big mistake coming here  should of walked right back out  On arriving was greeted by an unhappy looking chap who looked like he really didn t want to be there  when taken over to table had to wait over  min for menu and then rush for our order   Food itself wasn t something special it was ok  When we finished it seemed like they couldn t wait to get us out  Will not be going back anytime soon  
negative; As we all know Italian know foods better than most of the nations and they are very well cooks  We entered this restaurant is due to candle light dinner type for couple   First of all  I must admitted that the customer service was brilliant   services ran by father and son    The environmental was not overly excited especially the shabby look staircase carpet  grubby toilet without hand wash  dryer and old deco of plastic flowers hanging overhead on the beams    We had beautiful starters focaccias  pizza dough bread with tomato sauces and cheese on topping  and calamari  fried squids rings   Fresh salads based is good and lovely soft melted cheese was dying for    However when we received the main course  it was totally disgusting   I have been highly recommended by the owner to try the house famous Tortelli alla crema  my bf ordered an Italian Cornish pie  Calzone  dish    I found spaghetti carbonara  garlic mushrooms  spam strips and  soaked cream chips  in my  TORTELLI  dish  All in one  how bizarre it was  I was not dare to think about if my dish was really someone else  left over  and pile up in a plate GOSH did speak with the owner about the cream soaked chips however he said that must be his mistakes during the foods delivery  those chips were drops from other plates to mine    I dare not to think about the fact  however  the fact is I found two chips in the very bottom of the plate well hidden in the heavy  sauce  How could that possible if a chips dropped from other plates will be on top of the fish  What is the purposed of having  SPAGHETTI  noodles in the TORTELLINI dish  I am totally disgusted about the way it is they make it up    I am not sure has anyone else being treated in that way before  From all I can see  most of the customers were from outstations  only few local for  PIZZA  takeaway but not a pasta    My advise is if you really want to give it a go  please order only  PIZZA  not  PASTA   You never know what you will receive at the end  I left my tortellini dish % without eating it  The % of what I ate was before I found those   cream soaked soft chips   eughh   
negative;Where to start sat down at approx pm we were a table of  and  child  All ordered various starters which took over mins to arrive  three of us had Prawn Cocktails without the cocktail  sauce  had to ask for some  which did arrive quite promptly  starters were edible and everyone finished them  then we waited for the mains and we waited and we waited then they arrived but they were not ours so they disappeared  eventually approximately hr  mins later after being sat our mains arrived one by one  we all tucked in to find our food was stone cold very Unappealing  The waitress was very apologetic and offered us new meals  for which I declined it was by this time getting very late  we all declined desserts and asked for the bill  We only had to pay for the starters  but the whole evening was a great disappointment  
negative; We have been in the restaurant once before and had a very nice time  This why we decided to order a takeaway  What a big mistake  i used the online ordering system  we waited over an hour  the order still had not arrived sowe decided to ring and ask where the order was  they had no record of the order even though i received an order reference number so i had done everything correctly online  so we had to order again and wait another  minutes  when it arrived the food was no where near as good quality as last time  spent nearly nine pounds on a few bits of dried sea bass and the chicken dish hardly had any chicken in it at all  to top it all off it arrived luke warm  very disappointed and will not be using again  Feel completely ripped off  
negative; Probably the worst meal I ve ever had  Every aspect was dire  Looking into through the large window and the nice decor me and my starving mother decided to give The Folly a go  From the menu it appeared to be appetising although a little steep  but that was a price we were prepared to pay for expectedly good food in London  From the off set the service was poor  the waitresses at the door were extremely reluctant to give us a table even though most of the restaurant tables were empty  After a wait we were sat down at a table and told abruptly that they wanted their table back within the hour  which is laughable considering there were only  other tables filled in the large restaurant and after the hour this remained the case   Even though they were supposedly in a rush to get us to eat and leave this is where the service element practically stopped  from then on we were actively ignored  There were plenty of waiting staff who all seemed to be socialising with each other instead of working  We waited  long minutes to be asked for our order  even though we tried to get the attention of the pointless waiter waitresses several times beforehand  However the service turned out to be the least of our worried  I orded the   double burger which had a variety of toppings and sounded extremely flavoursome  this it was not  It was the blandest and coldest burger I have ever tasted  It made McDonalds look like fine cookery  And ar   you did not receive any side  just tasteless cold disappointing burger  My mothers steak and chips were sadly the same  tasteless  tough  and cold  How the meals were cold when the restaurant was not busy at all I dont know  Probably down to the poor waiting staff again  Our drinks were also over priced  my cider tasted flat and watered down  as a leader of a Real Ale Society I know my drinks  and my mother reported that her wine tasted odd  The decoration was also to blame  every time the door opened wind burst in making the reindeer skin rugs fly in our faces whilst we were eating and making us bitterly cold  To end this charade we were given a hilarious  % service charge which we refused to pay on the grounds there WAS NO SERVICE TO SPEAK of  And when asking for the manager whilst leaving were merely given a card  I m sad to say that the   I spent on this abismal experience for food and service that was worse that those found at the likes of Burger King is something I will never see again  therefore I am warning you to save yourself from my mistake at the Folly  DON T GO THERE  
negative; We went here as a group of  on a Friday evening    adults and two girls age  and   On our first couple of visits we were impressed  but this restaurant has changed for the worst  This time we had a totally different feeling about the place  The fact that there is now a set menu which wasn t the case when they first opened I think is to their detriment as is having to vacate your your table because of the next sitting  The set menu is expensive and as our girls are not big eaters we asked if they could share or have a smaller portion of something  We were told very bluntly NO  the owner was very rude in fact  Because of the early success of the restaurant they have become greedy and it shows in their attitude  At the time they opened there was little else to choose from in Swanage but thank goodness now there are other restaurants that far outweigh the quality of the food and the customer service  
negative; I am a long time customer in this restaurant  recently the employees were changed and now has a waiter or boss do not know  very arrogant  a tall woman with blond long hair  do not let us eat at all  is all the time forcing us to drink more and more  very push and unpleasant  not recommend this restaurant to anyone  this was my last time at this property  
negative; Look  we all know what we expect when going for Fish and Chips  Big oval plate  half of it filled with fish spilling over the side  the other half heaped with thick cut chips and a bowl of peas  beans  whatever you want on the side   Lets be clear from the start this is not what you ll be getting Kelly s  What you will get is a small piece of fish  a tiny portion of undercooked chips and overall a hatred of the popular British staple    Two of use ate here for over    Fish was cooked ok  apparently it is award winning  chips where terrible  peas where me h  The staff seemed disinterested and the facilities tired and a little sticky    Reading the reviews some actually like this experience and even go back for breakfast  Without going into who on earth would think eating breakfast at a chip shop is a good idea  and whether their views should be trusted  it beggars belief so many enjoy such a dreadful example of a seaside classic    Looe isn t blessed with great restaurants but really you can do better than this  I d recommend the chippy opposite and then eat them down by the river  Literally half the price and better quality than Kelly s  
negative;Arrived and ordered food  my friend said he would have the steak medium i said i would have the same a simple request  The food arrived my steak was rare and my friends medium  when this was pointed out to the French waiter he said that my steak was medium and thats the way we cook medium To which i pointed out that it was not and there was a vast difference between my steak and my friends  At this point he said that I had ordered it rare  unbelievable attitude and totally inconsistent and calling me in effect a liar   Spolt my meal  and stressed me out I would not expect that from a cafe at the top of my road let alone a restaurant that handed me a very hefty bill 
negative; Appalling service here  Firstly was confusing to know how to order and where from    We received only half our food order and it was all cold  The waiter then refused to believe it was cold before deciding to take it back to be heated  no apology   it then came back with the waiter claiming it was  so hot it was burning his hand    it was still luke warm   We asked for tap water and none was given and a side order did not even arrive but we were still charged for it   Appalling service and the most rude waiter I have come across  When we complained  there were again no apologies and he didn t believe what we were saying and was very rude   I would never expect service like this from a central london restaurant  I will never go back and will certainly not recommend it to anyone  
neutral; Visited here on Valentine night  The restaurant had been decorated with red balloons and looked nice  the lighting was very subdued  Very subdued indeed  Downstairs was full so we were seated upstairs  Service was very efficient  with the waiter very friendly  He seemed to enjoy a good banter with most of the customers  We had chili garlic bread for a starter which was very thin and tasty  The caesar salad was good with large pieces of chicken but perhaps could have been presented better  I had bean salad which was ok  I then had the sea food risotto which was very salty  The chicken gnocchi was described as quite pleasant  A few times the waitresses came near our area of the room and were not aware who had ordered what  it was up to the customers to call to them  On the whole it was a nice experience  
neutral; Visited on a Saturday evening with partner  we were seated in the upstairs section  if you ever book to go here  request downstairs as there is no atmosphere upstairs  We ordered a calamari starter to share which the chef kindly put on two dressed plates instead of serving one portion  The starter was very tasty and lightly battered  My partner ordered the fillet steak with parma ham and dolcelatti cheese on it  which he found enjoyable and not too filling  My main was the grilled seafood platter  which was slightly dissapointing as the salmon was not cooked and the swordfish was overcooked  They did however knock half the price of my main off as I let them know the problem  would I visit again  Probably not   One thing to also point out is that I was told that the waiting staff do not get to keep their tips  they go straight to management  so something to consider when you are tipping  
neutral;Can t fault the setting which is close to the river but was disappointed with the quality of the food  I ordered large fish and chips  but the fish was quite small  the batter was overcooked and fish itself was not what I expected  Friendly service but wouldn t eat there again 
neutral; First visit to Bambalan last night  was a nice venue with interesting dÇ¸cor  Didn t have food but the menu looks delicious  One massive flaw is that they do not serve wine in wine glasses but instead serve it to you in a tumbler  
neutral;We are regular enough customers   we eat here  or  times a year and get regular take outs with our family  My brother in law ordered a take out  weeks ago and instead of  chicken curries they gave him a chicken dish and a prawn dish  What luck that he wasn t allergic  He didn t eat it as he doesn t like seafood  We all went out for a meal this evening   we only chose the Simla as one of our party wanted a Tava   a signature dish of theirs  The one dish they messed up on was this  They gave him chicken tandoori   he doesn t eat chicken off the bone  No satisfactory compensation was offered  We won t be returning in a hurry 
neutral; Our visit here was a mixed bag of experiences  first and foremost loved the juicing bar fantastic variety  but found the service and food hit and miss  The portions were huge  starters yummy but did not feel the pricing reflected quality necessarily  for example a ample plate of humous and lamb was great value but the prawns were yummy but tiny and also The mixed grill  was very flavoursome and worth every penny  but then a lamb chops main at    was fatty and not cooked particularly well  I m not a great cook and can achieve far better at home   The service was prompt but it was particularly noticeable how different the customer service was from the staff when serving us and others of middle eastern origins  kinda kills the magic and experience when they grab your plates which still have food on without asking is this ok or speaking at all  then drowning other tables with attention and flirting  Thought this was rude and in the end paid our   bill for posh kebab and left feeling underwhelmed  So on that note if a decent filling kebab with lovely juice is what your seeking then this place is certainly worth a visit  
neutral; My wife and I visited this pub  as it had been highly recommended to us  Obviously our expectations were too high  Although the premises inside are very attractive  clean etc  we were very disappointed with the choice of food available on the menu  It was just what you can get in any other establishment  and it was cooked  and served in the usual manner  There was nothing to say about it to give it a better rating than anywhere else  
neutral; Needed something low in calories as on an eating plan and so we chose to do lunch here    Gave the menu a good look over on line and then chose what I had decided on  The meal did take a long time to come even though it was not very busy and I had to send mine back as it had chips on instead of rice   we then had to wait another  minutes before it returned with the correct rice   The ribs were ok but a very small portion  Salad was a good selection although the lettuce was a touch brown in some places  My friends meal was pretty spot on and his was a good size   If you are looking for a simple menu at a good price then worth giving this place a visit  
neutral; Drop in here occasionally for meetings as it s warm and cosy and the staff are friendly  Food today was uninteresting and my colleagues not impressed  
neutral; I have been watching with anticipation the referbishment of this wonderful building  and the results  it s stunning  well thought out  stylish and obvious lots of thought and hard work has gone into it  I am especially looking forward to the summer to use the outside space which looks just as good   Whilst the atmosphere in the restaurant was buzzing  the waitresses were very helpful and polite however I must agree with another review that perhaps they need some training  however it depends on what sort of restaurant this will become  A majority of our party of  were a little disappointed with their meals  portion size being the main issue  along with a uninspirational menu and in my mind rather expensive  so whilst we did have a couple of bottles of wine  wine list is great by the way  it worked out at   a head  okay perhaps for a special occasion but for many not an everyday option   Put it this way  it s not the sort of food menu and prices for a weeknight  shame it s menu isn t more like Milsomes   So would I go back  Not yet but if there was a change in menu then definitely for its  Setting and style  
neutral; My partner and I decided to go out for lunch at the Albany Hotel  we have visited many times for drinks but never eaten  As expected for a Bank Holiday there were queues to get seated and we had a  minute wait before a table became available  which in the grand scheme of things is no too bad  Once we got a table we ordered the scallops for starters which arrived in a good time and were well cooked and presented  however our main meal  Tagliatelle Marinara  took an hour to arrive  after a  minute wait I attracted the attention of the very busy  but very polite member of staff to ask just how long our meal would be  he returned and said it was  quot going from the pot to the plate right now quot  some  mins later it then did arrive  On first sight it looked a good plate of pasta  mussels and calamari   well mine did  My partner however had no prawns   of the mussel shells were empty and very little calamari  when he took his first few bites of the pasta he found broken pieces of mussel in his mouth  Our waiter did come and ask how the food was  just at the point as I was handing over a couple of my prawns to my partner  we advised him of missing prawn situation and he did say he would bring this to the attention of the kitchen  which he duly did as a very apologetic waitress brought out  cooked prawns in a dish  not quite the same as cooked in with the sauce that covered the dish  but a good token offer  and said as our meals had been cooked together I must have got all the prawns   I had  in total  so not really a generous amount even if they had have been dished out evenly   In future we will stick to just taking drinks at the Albany and sit by the river Thames and enjoy the views  rather than eat there again  
neutral;I have visited this restaurant a number of times  but haven t been back for a couple of months as the last time I went  the portions seemed to be a lot smaller and at the same price  This is also very much a winter only restaurant due to the types of dishes served  The food is nice  but you can wait a long time to be served on a Sunday afternoon 
neutral; The actual roast dinner which was a carvery you could not really fault and the price was good   it could have been a bit hotter though  I was not impressed when entering the pub as I was asked if we had a table booked which we did  and we didn t mind waiting as we were early  however I had to ask for drinks no one offered  The real disappointment was my dessert I ordered the chocolate brownie sundae  not very much chocolate at all in it and no chocolate sauce on top  not much of a sundae  Nice atmosphere and spacious  
neutral; I had lunch with a business colleague   we were post lunch really   PM    despite having booked we had to wait a long time for a table and the service was a bit sporadic thereafter  The waiters waitresses were all good looking and pleasant and the ambience of the cafe was good  The food was ok without being really great  I suspect that people go there to be seen rather than for the food  
neutral; overall the place serves good food and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful  I dont really like downing reviews to be honest  the last twice ive eaten here  the foods not been up to scratch  way too much lemon juice on the starter  that i had to send it back  main course was bland  maybe time to try a different dish  and this is not a cheap place  dont mind the price  if the food is spot on  which sometimes it is  sometimes it isnt :  
neutral; as a couple  me and my partner have visited pizzahut on middlebrook quite afew times the first few times we re great but each time I ve noticed something  there s hardly ever any choice and now it s not possible to get spaghetti bolognaise not even from the kids menu  yes I realise I m not a child but there s only so much pizza and garlic that one person can take without feeling queasy   don t get me wrong  the staff are always polite and pleasant to us  they always make sure that we are happy with our meals and that the salad bar and ice cream factory are fully stocked  The last time I went I settled for a stuffed crust anchovy pizza which was brilliant and a mushroom ravioli bake but it was incredibly garlicky and the side order of garlic bread didn t help much either and was rather greasy  It s brilliant for families and people with kids but for couples it s a definate no go 
neutral; Although service seems to have improved somewhat since our last visit  it s still pretty dire  I asked about using my meal voucher  purchased with our hotel stay  and had to really press to get details  I kept getting dismissed with  quot Your server will sort it out quot   but I wanted to know exactly what choice I had with the voucher   which is simply that you can order anything and would have taken a few seconds to explain    To her credit  the duty manager on during dinner service was very much present and seemed on the ball  Sadly  our server was confused  got our starter wrong  and forgot to bring some things we requested  The duty manager did take care of this for us   The food has actually improved somewhat  Just keep your standards low  i e  keep your expectations to pub chain levels  and you should be happy  Speed of service also seems to have improved  It s still not quick and you do need to flag people down  e g  ask for the bill while you re having pudding to save time   but it s certainly better than the + hours we ve waited in the past   Breakfast was average  Greasy  slightly soggy hash browns  overcooked scrambled eggs  and undercooked bacon but edible and big portions  Kids liked the cereal selection and croissants  The server was easily confused and I had to repeat our order  or  times  But it s quick and good value with the dinner meal deal  plus kids were free   Still lots of room for improvement  Monkey Puzzle  
neutral; Not the first time that we have visited this curry house but most likely the last  We waited an hour and  mins for our main course  A table near us who arrived after us had the same food and yet were paying their bill before we even got our mains  The staff gave cursory insincere apologies   a free soft drink might have been a small gesture that would have been greatly appreciated But nothing was forthcoming  Food not amazing enough to wait so long for service  
neutral; Nice and clean friendly staff  appeared to have many regulars dining there  Pizza fantastic  lots of flavoursome Meditteraean vegetables  Mexican burger bland  no taste at all  
neutral; Had a late lunch here with family including a young child  This is a lovely looking place both inside and out and children are obviously made very welcome  A friendly waitress showed us to our table and we had plenty of space and felt very comfortable  The menu looks the same as another McMullens pub in Turnford called the Bulls Head  and the food there is of good pub quality  Unfortunately the Plough  on this occasion  fell far short in food quality compared to the Bulls Head  I would imagine most of the items on the menu just need either deep frying or microwaving but even so the kitchen fell short of expected standards  We were all disappointed with our meals  One meal was greasy  another soggy and another literally swimming in BBQ sauce   Its a shame as its such a lovely looking little place  but next time I fancy a reasonably priced pub lunch I will return to the Bulls Head  If I had young children I would probably go back to the Plough but try to choose something on the menu that would be impossible to mess up  
neutral; This pub is local so we have visited many times in different groups of family and friends  and the experiences are extremely variable  For the Sunday Roasts  sometimes the portions are small with barely two slices of meat  and another times the portions are generous  well cooked and well presented  The menu offers all the usual suspects and the quality and standard of the meals seems to depend on which chef is on duty  The reason I avoid large corporate chains is because I don t want to have a meal that has been designed and prepared many miles away  but there does need to be some degree of consistency  Our most recent visit was for an evening meal  and the food was of a good standard  we had asked which chef was on before we ordered   The evening was slightly marred by a very loud and overbearing waitress who kept shouting across the room to ask if anyone wanted more drinks  or if the meals were OK  The other bar staff and waitresses were very pleasant and efficient  but again  the unpredictability of the food and the service makes us think twice before eating here  Like the nursery rhyme   quot when it is good  it is very very good  but when it is bad  it is horrid  quot  
neutral; Visited withy husband and  children on a Monday  Menu was great  full pub menu and pizza menu  Not too badly priced and food was fresh and tasty  Came back the next evening and was disappointed as only a fish menu on with a few dishes    Complete change from the day before   Bar staff all in desperate need of training and smiles  Waited ages to be served as they were very slow and to busy having their own conversations amongst themselves   Would visit again but maybe just stick to a drink and enjoy the view  
neutral; I took my sister over the Christmas holiday to your beautiful Establishment  Glorious surroundings  food just  quot OK quot  but we were disappointed about the Service which we both found too  quot relaxed quot   not focused on the customers: the waiter did not serve us  we had to do it ourselves which we think is not appropriate when % is added to the bill  albeit if we wish to pay it  and certainly not for such an elegant restaurant  We did not feel well looked after by the waiting Staff  we were practically left to our own devices  So  a mixed experience all in all  The waiters could do much better and our waiter was even dragging his feet when he walked up and down  Too  it is a shame that the kitchen staff had to go through the restaurant with the utensils to reach the kitchen but I suppose it is the layout which demands that  The restaurant can become too noisy when busy  We had  quot Choucroute quot  and it was not the best we had tasted  All in all: the Surroundings are what we liked the best  the Food was average and the service really poor  Please  please  improve  do justice to this magnificent venue   PS: you do not have a rating quot good quot   only  quot very good quot    why  
neutral;Friendly Pub   food is typical to what would expect from true pub and good price  Staff very friendly and welcome feel plus TV for those who may wish to watch Rugby
neutral;As a  chain  of restaurants this is exactly what it says on the tin  It s NOT a gourmet cuisine joint  neither is it a cheap greasy spoon cafe  If you re after either of the above then don t go there   then complain about prices or  standard  grub   What it offers is a good spot for a relaxed pre show meal  a varied menu to suit most tastes   especially those with youngsters    very clean surroundings with modern decor   Have visited this particular restaurant twice  once as a couple  the second earlier this week as a family  Both times were for a late lunch   ish  in order to avoid the busy period   The staff are extremely polite   helpful  We regularly use an iPhone app to check for any restaurant vouchers   saw online that some Prezzo branches offer a %discount  Sadly the Northumberland branch is one of those that opt out  however when we asked the server about it they gave us a website address we could register with which instantly sent us an online discount code for   off on an over   spend  Classic case of if you don t ask you don t get    for  mains with a bottle of white wine   soft drinks plus coffee gets the thumbs up in my book    I would say that you should probably do as we did and avoid busy periods as the service can be slow between courses  If it s slow when quiet I can t imagine how they cope at busy times   
neutral; Smells good as you step off the train but the chips were tired and there was more batter than fish  The staff were friendly and it was busy with hungry travellers  
neutral;Good value for money  alcohol not up to usual standard  on a couple of occasions the lager was warm  service was very good and choice excellent
neutral; Very average food  moderate service but good for meeting after work for a light supper  We hadn t booked and a rather cold window seat was all that was offered  
neutral; I have previously visited the Walter arms before a couple of years ago with a group of friends and I thought I would return again with my husband  I would start by saying that the food was lovely and we did enjoy it  However  the service could have been a lot warmer with a smile and less awkward  The atmosphere wasn t hugely great and we also felt the restaurants interior could have been reflected from the beautiful building that it is from the outside   Maybe get rid of the carpet    I probably wouldn t return again in a hurry  try The Crown at Playhatch or the Tally Ho  for a better all round experience  
neutral; On Good Friday visited the restaurant with a Colleague  Then another joined in the Service was good and food lovely  Took  persons on Monday night Easter Monday as it was very busy service was slow and the food was not as tasty as it was on the Friday However the Staff were very polite  
neutral; It was the first evening of our holiday  We had looked forward to a meal at the Anchor as we had read the good reviews  but we were most disappointed  I chose the roast pork with vegetables  It came piled up with  huge so called  roast  potatoes under the meat  They were so pale as to be their natural colour  very floury and dry  so I asked for more gravy which took some time  and when it came was very dark and salty  The meat was tasty but not generous  the vegetables too were rather mean  a dessert spoonful each of two types  My husband chose the razor clams and received three all very chewy  the size of a little finger  and  small shellfish  cockles    all heavily chili flavoured  We returned to our accommodation hungry and had cheese and biscuits  
neutral; We stopped off for breakfast before the first Grimsby   Market Rasen cricket match of the season and the food was great   I ordered smoked salmon on a toasted muffin with poached eggs and my boyfriend had the full English  I even got to eat his black pudding   The portion sizes were very good  however the prices are a little more expensive than usual  However the price reflects the exception quality of the produce so it is warranted   My only comment would be about the staff  The lady clearly couldn t cope and looked to be flapping a lot  She kept saying very loudly that she doesn t normal work Saturday and Sunday and was covering for someone  You can see why  Taking our order was a bit of a chore for her  as was getting our drinks  Shame as we would return for the great breakfast but we didn t feel entirely welcome to be honest  
neutral; It was busy  which made for a long wait for a table  but once settled the food was good  
neutral; Great venue  friendly staff it was big shame about the saltiest meal I have ever tasted in my life which was the pheasant wrapped in bacon with very salty fried stuffing on salty gravy and salty purÇ¸ed potatoe  My friend ordered omelette with side order of chips  the chips were lovely    I will return here but will stick to anything with chips  
neutral; We met up for a family get together  the starters were yummy   although the Camembert wasn t runny enough for our liking  as were the main courses BUT the kitchen were obviously running out of roast beef by the time we ordered ours   slivers of beef disguised with heaps of cabbage  now I love veg and all of it was perfect  crunchy and well seasoned But I am a carnivore at heart and that was a disappointing roast dinner   
neutral;  course meal just over   a bargain you can have anything on the starter and main   It was a pleasant surprise  Had the buffalo wings very soft source a bit too sweet even with my sweet tooth lol   The combo beef and chicken fajitas were rather dissapointing not well seasoned had to keep adding salt and chill  Having said that the food was average but I would go back to try the burgers as they looked good :   
neutral;Carverys are a bit hit and miss in my experience   depending on the turnover and how lucky you are with the timing of the veg refills  This visit was on a busy Sunday lunchtime so the food was refreshed regularly  and in this case the roasts were really well cooked and tasty  portions not too large but that is to be expected  No doubt this restaurant provides excellent value for money and the staff were friendly and helpful   a little chaotic but again not unexpected when the restaurant is so busy  A good option for a good size  good value Sunday lunch 
neutral; They are just disgusting  Tried some other food the other day  It s alright  very average  One day ordered coffee and desserts  Coffee tastes a hot water only  Desserts been re frozen few times and taste just awful  We couldn t eat at all  Customer service of one of the girls is equal to none  when we just mentioned about the quality of the food  she started arguing with us  which I find absolutely unacceptable even in such informal places as pub   We been to the pub before for several occasions but our last time made us feel no to come here anymore  Hope the owner of the place notices this comment    
neutral; We had a birthday dinner here recently and both had a wonderful bruschetta to start  Main course I had pasta which honestly didn t taste much different to a supermarket bought ravioli  Sorry to say  The pizza  however  was delicious and we had some tasty cocktails too  I was expecting spectacular  freshly made pasta which it didn t appear to be  Shame  Lovely inside though and friendly staff  
neutral; Dined recently and won t go into detail by dish  suffice to say  it felt that the majority of dishes  or elements of others  were mass produced bought in products  Examples being the onion rings  duck spring rolls  the  gravy  within the steak and ale pie  lacking any element of ale   the chicken wings and breaded mushrooms  Some of these I could accept  but the majority  I m afraid no  Not for an independent and local pub  This should be left to the mass catering National chains  Who in all honesty do this type of food cheaper  and where I generally choose not to go   The staff were friendly  knowledgable and efficient   everything you would expect from a village pub  and possibly a little more   Shame  
neutral; If you like the menu  the food is good  It s a small and specific style  not necessarily my thing so found the choices very limited  Have been twice and their big steak dish was definitely less impressive othe second visit  so consistency for their main attraction is questionable  Good service  fun presentation  
neutral; Food is generally good standard  but we were given just  small dishes of vegetables between  people which clearly wasn t enough  so much so that we had to decide who was going to have the  pieces of carrot and the  pieces of broccoli etc  We could of course requested more  but the waitress was somewhat elusive and as we had already waited an hour for our food to arrive  we really just wanted to get on with it  However  the roast beef turkey was plentiful with good roast potatoes  Puddings seem pricey for the portion sizes  eg    for  small scoops of ice cream   
neutral; Overall was fairly satisfied but I think this place needs to retrain their staff  We were left waiting an hour and  minutes  after being told there was a  minute wait  When we were eventually seated  right by the kitchen  we could see hear staff standing around talking for long periods of time  However once the food arrived it was very nice  portion sizes are massive so would not bother getting a starter beforehand  
neutral;Ok we returned to the Homely maid after our st visit was not very enjoyable  Our orders were taken promptly and our drinks arrived  The food was off a much better standard than our previous visit  Still need to check on fresh rocket  we know it s a garnish but finding yellow garnish is not appealing  Friendly staff  thank you was good to return  
neutral; Good food and you do get a lot for your money  But really don t rate the customer service  Walk in and all the staff look grumpy the lady said hello what do you want in a u inviting manner which made you feel completely unwelcome  After that I felt really sorry for people in the reataurant  Once I had the food or was amazing  
neutral; Do like the food here  have been a number of times this year  but recently experienced some bad service  My mum  who has had gastric surgery  cannot eat adult sized portions of food  and tried to order a child s meal   something which she has done successfully in a number of other establishment  and at the Haig  they point blank refused to serve her  and told her to order an adult sized one and just cut in half  even though that wasn t what she wanted   They were adament you had to be a child to have a child s meal  which i feel is quite frankly pedantic and unecessary   The food is usually quite nicely presented pub grub fayre  so the chef works hard  unfortunately the popularity of this pub has gone to its head and they seem to think customer service is not necessary  Such a shame  my family won t be going back unless something drastic changes  
neutral; Our group of   many who had not been here before were looking forward to the evening  Starters were all very good and service friendly and efficient  Unfortunately the rib eye steaks were the worst had by many of the group  tough as old boots and tasteless it is not cheap and you cook the steak on a hot stone so they really have to be good   After bringing it to the attention of staff they agreed they hadn t been up to scratch so took them off the bill and offered complimentary drinks  Whilst we appreciated this and glad the staff took on board the issue  I would expect a good chef to be up to speed and to check the meat they are serving   Just to add the sirloin was very good and the chicken and ribs were lovely  However some of the group said they would not return which is a shame  
neutral; Went here for my dad s th birthday party  Place wasn t too busy when we got there which was nice  Food choice was ok could do with some more variety  You have to pay up front for food and drinks  due to other people not paying in the past  Staff were friendly enough  My brother had a special which was steak and it looked nice and his ex partner also had a prawn special which also looked nice  Desserts were ok but like mentioned earlier need more variety on the starters and the main  Parking isn t too brilliant either but we did manage to park just up the road 
neutral; Went there with some friends two nights ago and received a warm welcome  The food was pretty authentic and what ther was of it was good  My main gripe was the special   langoustine and prawn tagliatelle  Apart from the chilli element which nearly blew my head off  the seafood consisted of   a small langoustine and ONE prawn  When I complained I was told   eventually  that sorry  it should have contained TWO prawns    What a rip off  They said no one had ever complained before but did begrudgingly change my order  but it then arrived after my companions had finished and basically took the edge off the evening  
neutral; Attended here last night fathers day with my husband and daughter waited mins just to get a drink followed by an hour to get our food which when it arrived was just warm  fries were cold and the mussels were  quot the smallest I HAVE EVER SEEN quot  and I made a point of saying so especially because of the price    The steak was good but my husband said his food was just warm and the poor fella was starving but we did not want to make a scene after waiting so long    and like most there suffered it I was shocked really especially because our daughter had said its quite good normally  we did tip the waiter though because we enjoyed the beers and whiskey  Don t think its as good as folk say especially for expensive food at over   for  of us and we left hungry and disappointed  Food as expensive as this should be hot and on time    The waiter made a big thing of trying to get us to push the new venue coming in canary wharf don t think so sorry 
neutral; Chose this as we love morrocan and although the food was hot and tasty it did lack a bit of flavouring and spice  Good mint tea though 
neutral; When Almost Famous was in the Northern Quarter  it was more chilled out and better quality  The staff were friendlier and more attentive  and it felt like a real love of the mighty pink burger that it ran on  ignoring the  too cool for anything  look   However  now that it s moved to it s bigger and bolder location near AMC  it has gained an arrogance that has really affected the quality  The burgers used to be tasty  pink and juicy  now they take far too long to come  are very over done with little attention paid to piling things on top  I was offended when recommending this place and a friend said  meh   after my last couple of visits though  I now agree  Nothing special anymore   but you can still delight in the  hour wait  if that makes it feel more worth it  
neutral; Staff friendly   although they had forgotten we had booked  Food nice but no atmosphere  it was a cold evening and the glass conservatory was chilli   
neutral;Walked in and no one acknowledged us  had to find our own seats and was too long till anyone gave us a menu  no one smiled the whole time we we re there and the people next to us who came in  minutes after us got served first  The food tasted ok bit the pizza had about  pieces of chicken on  Wouldn t go back 
neutral; I went to Hoppers with my Sri Lankan husband and having lived in Sri Lanka myself  we are both very familiar with Sri Lankan cuisine  We arrived when it opened for the evening at   pm and there was already a queue forming and it quickly filled up so be prepared to wait a while for a table unless you arrive really early  Although the decor and atmosphere was nice it was fairly cramped and if you are going in a pair be prepared to be sharing a table with limited elbow room  The service was quick and efficient and the staff offered to explain the menu to us  The food we ordered was tasty but seemed to be more influenced by South India than Sri Lanka   the curry sauces were thick with more coconut and less chilli than a typical Sri Lankan curry   although authentic Sri Lanka curries may be too hot for many people The hoppers however were pretty authentic  My curry  kari  and hopper was presented on a trendy dimpled metal tray  definitely not typical of Sri Lanka    It is quite hard to eat a hopper off a tray in the way Sri lankans do   breaking off a piece of hopper and scooping up the curry from the plate   and I did not feel comfortable eating on it  The love cake dessert was really nice  but a bit disappointed by the pineapple and black pepper cocktail which sounded interesting but according to my husband was drowned out by pineapple so you could not taste the arrack  a Sri Lankan spirit  which usually has a distinctive taste  The prices I guess were reasonable for Soho but more expensive than other Sri Lankan restaurants further out of town  I think it is a fine place if you want to try hoppers for the first time  dont like your curries too hot and don t mind queuing but don t expect it to be typically representative of Sri Lankan cuisine  
neutral; Came here with a foodie friend for some pre drinking and dancing grub  Heard rave reviews about Fire and Stone so thought we would give it a shot  Had to wait a while to be served as there were so many big parties  one very loud one in particular  Restaurant itself was lovely  food was good  but we had to wait a while to be served and to have our bill brought to us  Nevertheless I d still visit again :  
neutral; Popped in earlier today and the barmaid s poor attitude and manner has prompted me to write this  Te pub is nice  as is the convenient location  but the service was one of the worst I ve encountered  She was rude  miserable and frankly so off putting I wouldn t bother going there again if I saw she was bar tending  Slamming drinks on the bar and grunting the cost of the drinks is not what I call cystine service  Very annoyed to have a lovely afternoon drink ruined by the attitude of the staff  
neutral; This was my second visit but I think it will be my last  I visited with a Groupon deal and this time unlike the first  I was seated at the back  On a previous visit  we got the front seating  One difference is that with the back  you don t get a lot of offers coming as much as the front  The meat was salty  especially if you like yours well done and then choose to get the cut from outer bits then you will be wishing you didn t  The concept of unlimited cuts is nice but the meats have little flavour  I left the place very disappointed  Watch out for the drinks prices   my partner ordered double JD and coke and it came to If not for the groupon deal then it would have been poor  
neutral;We went here after the races and were the only people in there  On a Saturday night  The food was okay  there were alot of set menus   very average really and the drinks were really expensive  Also  even though we asked if they could get us some taxi cabs they just directed us to the taxi place a couple of blocks away 
neutral;We have been turned away twice  once we were told they were not serving  even though they had customers in  second time we were told it was a forty minute wait   however there was a table avaliable  Just get the feeling they are not keen on prams  young children  Very disappointed 
neutral;The steak and London Pride pie is a little expensive at over   but is a good pie  actual mashed potato and seasonal veg  There are plenty of seats and the staff are attentive  Slightly more expensive than O Neills further down Euston Rd  and with less on the menu  but what there is  though more expensive  is noticeably better 
neutral; I visited here today with my daughter  The cafe was clean and modern and the toilets nice  The staff were friendly   I was very disappointed with the food  My daughter had fish fingers and the fish was a grey brown colour  I can only assume they were cheap ones  I was cringing watching my daughter eating them  I would have expected nice white fish  The chips were also very greasy   It was a shame as there is the potential to make it a lovely place  
neutral; Looked like decent pub grub the large portion of lasagne didn t really need chips and garlic bread as we ll but it s the first time I ve had lots of gooey melted cheese on top instead of sauce on the calorie front not to be repeated On a more serious front the disabled loo doesn t comply as far as the handle and lock are concerned 
neutral; The food was lovely and it was quite cheap as it was only   for me and my boyfriend  All was well up until we were ready to leave after our meal but could not get the waitresses attention for the bill  We sat for about  minutes waiting to leave  But overall the food was great and came in good time  
neutral; My husband and I went here weekly with our kids  unfortunately the man Mark behind the bar is no longer there He always put my children at ease and made them feel comfortable  We went last week and in honesty the service was pretty poor  we had to wait ages for the food to be topped up the service was slow and the lady behind the bar had very few manners and frightened my children  We won t be visiting there again in a hurry unless we find out that Mark is back  
neutral; Really nice pub  Scotch egg starter was perfect  Had the burger for main  bun was stale and not toasted  Onion rings very greasy and chips were good  Burger flavour itself was great but it was very over cooked  Lovely staff and great location  Would come again but not get a burger  
neutral; We stayed at the hotel which was amazing but obviously not the same company own Aqua shard as the service was poor and the food was average  We had actually booked for four and the table they gave us was tiny it would have been very uncomfortable had our guests not had to cancel  They didn t clean the table once so we sat with breadcrumbs all over the place and we had to eat the bread as the portions were beyond a la carte small  not very impressed at all which is such a shame as we came all the way to London to try it  
neutral; This pub restaurant is in a brilliant location but the attention to customer focus  lets it down  We had good service and the food was excellent  However we visited on a very hot day but not one outside table had any cover from the sun  such as a few umbrellas   we had to rely on the shade given from the pub wall  All tables had an ashtray in situ  so there was no segregation between smokers and non smokers  so you have to contend with wafting cigarette smoke  not a good experience plus cheeky seagulls  who try and steal your food  Maybe best to sit inside  
neutral; I ordered the standard plate carvery which was I think  which was very cheap  the food was good  not rubbish but not amazing  There is a adult only area at the front of the pub which seemed to be quite warm however as we had a toddler in our party we had to sit in family area which was absolutely freezing I didn t take my coat of  I think that quality reflects the price here  
neutral; I wanted to really love this restaurant having spent the last three years trying to persuade my family to vist it with me  I finally went last week with my family and friends and I was so disappointed  The interior design  the lighting  the layout were atmospheric and interesting and I love the architecture of the building  the staff were professional and attentive HOWEVER the food was far from memorable  Some of the portion sizes were mean and the unadventourous menu could only be excused if the execution was faultless  it was not  We had a good time as we were all in a good mood anyway but I thought it was such a shame that the food did not match up to the setting  By the way if you are going to do an amuse bouche it should be larger i e  one or two bites  it was the size of a p piece and it looked so sad on its large plate  I suspect this restaurant started out being really good and is now living on past glories  
neutral; Cheap food  you get what you pay for  Can not complaint about the food but very slow service  something happened with our food  we waited for our mains at least for  minutes even if the restaurant was not full  Don t think we ll be back 
neutral; Went last Saturday at   for a birthday celebration  Party of twelve  Waited over one and half hours for our meal  Good job we did not order starters  The young girl serving our table was very good and apologetic  The restaurant had only two other tables being served  Food was o k  nothing special  We did not order sweet as by the time the meal arrived we were all past eating after the long wait  Shame really as we had good reports about the food and atmosphere  
neutral;This was a second visit and first time thought it was quite good but on reflection we were a group and maybe that took the focus off the food  This visit we had the two course menu choices quite good but the food was tasteless  Chicken and chips or spaghetti the pasta was ok the chips poor   % service charge added which was a bit much but the service was quite pleasant and certainly efficient we were in and out in  minutes so not a place for a relaxing meal  We won t be hurrying back but if you want reasonable priced meal close to Waterloo then it s OK 
neutral; We visited here on Mothers Day on the off chance of a table   as we had not booked  we were lucky to get a table on the decking area  which was lovely and with the nice weather it was a bonus  We were advised that we had five minutes to pick off the menu as they were about to stop serving  we chose as quick as we could  but when we went up to Order we were told we were too late  I felt this was unfair and we shouldn t have been offered the option if this wasn t going to be possible We had drinks and left to find our breakfast elsewhere  A real shame as it did seem very nice and the food looked pretty good  
neutral; went for late lunch with a friend initially service was slow for the starters portions on starters very small with just a tiny lettuce leaf as garnish main course when it did come minimal amount of vegetables and on the other main course the gammon was too salty to eat average pub grub other than that 
neutral; This place has the potential to be fantastic  the quirky dÇ¸cor and mismatched crockery make you feel lie you are part of the Mad Hatter s teaparty  but the setting is all wrong  There are so many more older style buildings in Skipton that would make a far better setting for this place  The staff lack lustre and sparkle  and most of them are for too  quot normal quot  and boring to be here  The cakes could be much better  the selection does not seem to vary a great deal  The tea is good  with proper leaves  not bags  The ids drinks are more boring and ordinary than is apparent from reading the menu  Everything has a major sugar overload  which would be okay if there were alternatives too  I really want to like this place  I have visited several times now  and have realised that I don t  really  
neutral;I came here using my taste card  for  with a friend  Pizza is a safe option as we both like pizza  We didn t receive a proper pizza cutter or any format of appropriate tool to cut the pizza so that made things hard  Staff seemed at bit spaced and not really paying much attention to customers  We were sat close to a pay station and even with our hands raised and saying excuse me as staff walked passed it took at least  minutes for somebody to come over  Our food took about + minutes to come out and people who come in after us were getting the or food before us  The food itself was nice but the whole experience here wasn t great  probably will not come back 
neutral; We had breakfast here and enjoyed the view as it is on the sea front  The coffee could have been warmer and the eggs benedict was a bit average  one of the poached eggs had some runny white which I don t like personally while the other one was a bit hard  
neutral; Went here with a friend  Staff and service good  My friend had scampi and chips with salad which looked quite good but can t go wrong really with cooking that dish  I had the risotto which is my favourite  I have had some good risottos including my own and I have had some poor ones  This pubs risotto was absolutely dreadful  chef needs to learn how to cook risotto  It was like a congealed sticky mess  Won t be ordering this again for sure 
neutral;We popped into Nando s at The Mall  The service was good  Food was cold   corn on the cob and the garlic bread was barely warm  Taste was good 
neutral; Went on a lovely hot day  had a steak which wasn t trimmed  and a cesaer salad which was tasteless   cocktail was also ok  But the staff were great  We asked if we could have a drink outside on the large sunny patio outside the restaurant   however after the waiter checked we were told the manager said no  How strange such a missed opportunity on a sunny day  so we went to another pub to have our drinks  Probably won t return as we were quite disappointed with the food  
neutral; We went to The Hollies today for late breakfast  We ve been a few times before for lunches  and taken friends  as it s near to where we live and convenient  The first time we went we thought it was great  nice food  good service  very comfy surroundings  all new and pristine  Since then we have seen this restaurant lose its edge  All the things we liked about it have deteriorated  We have noticed the quality of the food is not as good as it was  Today they got my husband s breakfast order wrong  although there were only two tables to be served at the time  I ordered a  quot hot buttered teacake quot   This was  in fact  a cold buttered teacake  One of the directors was sitting at the next table to us and he overheard me say this  so he said he would get them to make me another one  but by this time my husband was nearly through with his breakfast and the moment when I wanted to eat anything had gone  I don t know whether they ve had problems with chefs  but the quality of the food has deteriorated  Also  I think a restaurant should look as appetising as its food and I m afraid that today I noticed the crockery looked as though it needed a good clean  My milk jug was dirty with bits stuck around the edge  The last time we went to the Hollies  I actually had to complain about the length of time we were made to wait for our food  It was unacceptable  The service is quite slapdash  wrong orders  inattentiveness  and noone around to ask for another coffee  or tea  It s no use training staff to ask you  at the end of your meal  if  quot everything was allright quot   It s too late by then  While you re eating  they should come to the table  at least once  to see if you would like anything else  It s a great shame because this place could be great  It s in a lovely setting and they have obviously spent a lot of money on fitting it out  More attention should be paid to staff training  This morning  one breakfast  teacake  tea and coffee was    Too expensive  I think  for what we got  I don t think we shall come here again  
neutral; We visited The Lighthouse for a family Sunday lunch and had a very enjoyable time  However  at    per head for  courses  we felt that some of the food could have been better  in particular the beef was a cheap cut and it showed  We also tried belly pork which was very tasty but  again  a cheap cut  We tried a scallop starter  with a supplement  which was tasteless but a duck dish and chicken liver pate delivered on flavour  Deserts were very good  The restaurant was busy with a happy family atmosphere  Some of the service could have been more friendly and we found our waitress rather cold and distant  Water glasses were not filled and we were not offered a jug for the table  although we could see that others had their own jug so we had to keep asking  When we asked for one of our party to have their meat cut up in the kitchen due to disability  we were told no  they were too busy and could we do it ourselves    Then it arrived nicely cut so why say no in the first place  This is a nice place for a local Sunday lunch  I would not travel to go there 
neutral; I came here for a lunch meeting and to be honest I was very underwhelmed by the  vegetarian options on the menu  one started and one main   As a vegetarian it really annoys me that restaurants lazily don t have enough good vegetarian options on their menu  I can t remember what main I ordered  I literally just said  quot the vegetarian one quot   but I remember that it tasted good  it did not blow my taste buds away  it was pretty average  I remember it had an egg on it and looked like a superfood salad   The vegetarian meal was definitely overpriced    The service was good but I remember one of the waitresses leaning over and across me to pour wine for my friend sat next to me which  I don t think is right for the kind of establishment it is meant to be  The interior is nice and has a good atmosphere  
neutral; Took the kids as a new year s treat for the famous  all you can eat buffet   Reasonable choice of pizzas  although at times we had to wait as it seemed they couldn t cook them fast enough to keep up with the demand  Staff were friendly enough but pretty much leave you to it  We visited on the th of Dec and there wasn t a Christmas decoration in sight  and the place was generally quite noisy and some of the customers were quite rude  So not a great atmosphere   but the kids enjoyed it  and you can t really argue with the price  Plus the ice cream factory is lovely  much better choice of sauces and toppings than in most other places  So overall glad we went  
neutral;With one exception   see below   everything about Luigi s was  well   quot reasonable quot   not more but no less   menu choice  food quality  drinks  at table service and bill  We paid just under   for a three course dinner for two on a Saturday night  inclusive of wine  water and service  With a little effort  you could probably have prepared  cooked and presented as good a standard yourself at home  but  saying that  the quality was OK  the attempt to create an experience of Italy in suburban Arnold was fair enough and the value for money was broadly OK   The exception however  was the environment  which was a real downer and a shame because other TA contributors have said this before  but it doesn t seem to change  Luigi s are simply unrealistic about the number of tables they squeeze into their smallish premises and the number of different parties they try to accommodate on the same night  This leads to the problems that others have already described people crammed standing into a tiny space between the small bar and some tables  waiting for their table to be ready  too many diners crammed in together  every party s conversations intruding into those of their neighbour  waiting staff constantly bashing into your chair backs because of the tight spaces  and longer than average waiting between courses  So whilst the individual waiting staff are friendly and doing their best  you get the sense that the whole environment is just five minutes away from getting tense   which is not conducive to relaxed dining  All a bit of an accident waiting to happen really  So  remove some tables and probably more people would return   But  at the moment  it s reasonable dining for people who maybe don t dine out very often 
neutral; I quite like it  but the prices are high  the decor mixed and it seems a bit confused as to what it tries to be  There are too few people except on sunny days  
neutral; Called in for lunch  Restaurant interior is a bit canteen like  Did not like the fact that the toilets and kitchen facilities are closely located on the first floor as this was used constantly during lunchtime  The door was left open for periods during the meal so there was a constant cold draught of air  There was a manageress giving group directions which could have been done before diners arrived I thought  Food was average but not as good as GBK in Trafford park  With all the choice in Liverpool One would not return based on this experience  
neutral; I visited this place since I heard that it s lovely but I was greatly disappointed  It is a nicely decorated place but it s not cozy at all  The staff are friendly but the food is mediocre  incredibly small portions and overpriced  Would not visit again  
neutral; Had an evening meal here  which was ok and the staff were friendly enough  The thing that let this down for me were the  locals  and kids that sit in the bar and just stare at you  When I mean stare I mean they sit and stare at you for as long as you are in there for  Also the language was pretty foul and considering there was another family in there with kids I thought it was pretty disappointing that the owner people working didn t ask them to calm their language down  This was more like a drop in centre for local delinquents  
neutral; We had a really fun evening here for a friend s birthday  He d hired the room for  hours  for a group of  people   the room was really big  so could easily accommodate more people    We had a bit of a problem with the TV at the beginning of the evening  as the member of staff who showed us to the room didn t know how to make it work  but once we went downstairs and asked  they came and fixed this for us  and agreed to give us a bit of extra time at the end of the session as a result   They have a good range of songs on offer  although not excellent   there was a definite lack of Disney   and we had fun dancing around the space and singing to our heart s content  It was a pain having to go down two floors to get drinks and bring them back up again  and the staff could have been more friendly    Overall   not as slick as some of the chain karaoke places around  but less strict on time and with a lot more space  
neutral; Ate here as a couple  Restaurant was quite empty when we arrived  It is quite cramped inside  The food was quite good and good value  Some of the staff were really nice but one member of staff was a little surly otherwise I may have rated them a four  
neutral; We stopeed here after a walking weekend in the Roaches  I ordered a baked potato  The dish was plentiful with salad as well  but the potato was not baked  but just microwaved so there was no crispy skin  Great cup of tea but a crispy skin on the potato would have given this review a higher rating   Another downside  there is only one lavatory each for ladies and gents  For a place this size  more would be appropriate  Plenty of parking  which is a bonus and friend staff  
neutral; Four of us went to the Tudor Restaurant IN Bridgwater for a meal and although the table had been chosen and booked a week earlier we were told we could not have that table and had to wait minutes for another table  Unfortunately this table was not in the main restaurant but in a corridor outside and the table was small and cramped  However we order from the early bird menu and the food was alright but not fantastic  The waitress was very helpful and extremely pleasant  Overall it disappointing  
neutral; Popped in here this morning with husband  son and little grandson  Not visited for some time and was pleased to see the cafÇ¸  as it s self service I won t elevate it by referring to it as a restaurant  very busy  We all decided to have Americano coffee and scones with jam  for husband and myself  and a Danish pastry  for our son   I would point out that where in most places a  regular  cup of coffee is the smaller size  here there is small  regular and  presumably large cup being offered  So our  regular  was a quite sizeable cup and too much liquid for me  so be warned that if you want a small cup  to ask for one  Also  it meant I was paying for coffee I didn t drink  But our own fault   we should not presume that  regular  in this case was larger than the average  regular    Other than that  everything was fine and the scones were well cooked and not too large  with quality jam  Wilkin   Son Tiptree jam    We would certainly visit again for tea or coffee  
neutral; Having had good meals before  our meal on Saturday night was very disappointing  We had unfortunately recommended the Trout to our four friends who we joined for the evening  The meal was a trail of disasters from start to finish  The  waiters were fantastic in trying to sort out the problems with our food and drinks  They were fighting a losing battle  It was a nice atmosphere in the restaurant but we had problems with all of our meals except one  We may return but not until there is a chance for issues with the kitchen to be addressed  
neutral; Had lunch here with a friend  When I saw the prices on the menu outside I thought these must be big pizzas to share  but once we were sat down I discovered they were individual   and when they came  they were only average size  I had one of the cheapest ones and it was nearly a lot for some dough and a thin topping  However I was impressed with the fresh orange juice which tasted freshly squeezed  not from a carton  The staff were pleasant but service felt a bit rushed  I wouldn t go back  purely on poor value for money  
neutral; I love las iguanas  and have eaten at this one and several others on a number of occasions  On this occasion the food and drinks were as good as ever  and as a Gluten Free person  I appreciate their clearly labelled menus   However  service was disappointing on this occasion  We were a group of   and near to us were a group of probably about  or so  Basically they could not cope with two such large groups  Our food did not come out together  and after some of our food had come out  they also started bringing out food for the larger group  To me it would have made sense to serve one group  and then the other  My plates were also not cleared   I think due to the fact I was sat in the middle  so it wasn t easy for them to reach  tut I would have happily passed them over if they d asked  and eating dessert with mine and my neighbours plates still on the table was not ideal   At    a waiter then approached our table to inform us that they needed to table back at    Once we were told this  I did have a vague recollection that it had said this on the email confirmation I received  However this was not mentioned to us at any time prior to this  and when I had received the email  I thought it was one of those things they just always said  This lead to a very rushed end to our meal  A reminder when we had arrived  or even at   would have been useful   Not saying I will never go to las iguanas again  and other  bigger venues have dealt with groups better  just not sure this venue is quite large enough to deal wi such big groups  
neutral; Always too busy  far better places to eat in Beckenham then here  Good for the teens but that is about it 
neutral;The pub is easy to find  Bit dark and drab  Would like more light in there  We had a wrap and panini which was the lunch deal with a drink and it was very good  Price was very reasonable 
neutral; It is better but is still poor food  decor more pleasant  Made an effort with free buffett at New Year very good  
neutral; This place was just average really  We came in at  for lunch  The service was incredibly slow  so slow in fact that the  year old fell asleep waiting for his lunch  The food eventually came out to us just before two  We wouldn t have minded but the place wasn t even busy  The food itself was lovely  Once we got it  I do however have some concerns about allergy awareness here  I went looking for an allergy menu  which they do have for gluten intolerance  and couldn t find a menu so I asked one member of staff who said she didn t know  She then went and asked another who came back and said  quot we have this allergy menu for gluten will that do  quot  As I m allergic to eggs    Not really  They couldn t produce an allergy folder outlining what everything has in it so I just had to hope for the best and on this occasion the risk paid off  Our food was nice but the allergy concerns and the slow service makes this just an average place to dine  
neutral; My aunt and I popped in here after the theater  friendly lady outside  I felt the food was fairly good value for its location  I had bruchetta and salad both really tasty  Service was cold and hostile though  shame would have popped back if it wasn t for that   Tip   Try to be helpful if peeps want a photo with their meal  my aunt was a tourist that day and you are located in the center of tourist district  
neutral; Have been here many times  Good service  polite staff  Food   your average Indian food but nice  There was twenty of us last time and they where very quick at getting the food out :  
neutral; I have only ever been for lunch  Food is OK  nothing special 
neutral; As much as I love Tom Kerridge  we have now had two breakfasts  a lunch and a dinner here  I can only really recommend the breakfast as the lunch and dinner are rather disappointing  The wait time is not worth the experience in general  The waiting area is hot and uncomfortable and the eventual seating is cramped and the service not as good as you would expect   We were rushed into ordering another dish or dessert as the kitchen was closing at :pm and decided not to bother  It is hard to order a dessert whilst eating your lunch  it spoils the experience and the food would have gone cold in the meantime   Other diners seemed disgruntled at waiting for their drinks order that had taken ages   All in all not a good review for which I am sad but it is necessary for them to acknowledge the problems here  
neutral; Been here a few times for family birthdays and get together and the food is always beyond satisfaction  Curry s are served in a unique jar which bodes in well with the theme of the restaurant  Staff are a good laugh and don t mind when the diners are getting rowdy  Takeaway wise though I d recommend using somewhere else    It arrived late and was stone cold by the time it did eventually arrive and we don t live too far away  Was really disappointed and it actually put me off Mumbai blues for a while  
neutral; Came here with as a group of   We were welcomed and sat at our table promptly which was a good start  We got served the wrong wine  times until finally the correct bottle came to our table  Food coming out was slow and we were all getting our meals one by one    Would if hoped for more efficient and faster service considering it wasn t very busy anyway  
neutral; I ve been before  especially when it first opened and loved it  However  on my last visit I had mixed reviews  Firstly  my partners chips turned up and then were cold  although mine were hot  He also ordered chicken and chips and that was literally what he got  There wasn t anything else with it and didn t even look like a whole chicken breast  He was therefore still hungry afterwards  I did have a burger and enjoyed though  The other issue was that there was a guy in the corner who was clearly drunk and he was getting louder and louder  It kind of ruined the evening and Wildwood staff did nothing to quiet him down  
neutral; I recently visited this restaurant and found it to be a nice restaurant with a good feel to it  The service was good but apart from that  it was nothing to write home about  I ordered the seafood paella and found it to be very bland  Friends that I visited with ordered the meat paella and that was slightly better  but still not brilliant  The tapas looked nice but I can t comment on how good that was as I didn t have any tapas dishes  It was a nice evening with a nice feel to it but I can t say that I d be rushing back anytime soon for the food  Worth a visit for their tapas deal maybe  but not full price at dinner time  
neutral; I went here with a group of  friends to round off a hen party  We were there with the mother od the bride and a couple of babies to have Sunday lunch  The menu is quite limited  there was no vegetarian option  aside from a goats cheese salad starter that you could order as a main  One of the group had phoned in advance to request a veggie option  so upon arriving we were surprised there wasn t one  We asked staff who after badgering told us they would throw together something with puff pastry and vegetables to serve with the roast trimmings  fine  except the roast potatoes are advertised as beign done in duck fat When the food came the only vegetarian order we had placed had been forgotten  consequently everyone was at least half way through the meal before the vegetarian one arrived  We had to ask twice for the staff to chase this up    To be fair  I had roast beef and it was awesome  Lots of lovely rare beef  good vegetables and a good price at Gravy was translucent  aside that it was yummy  The roast chicken also looked great  as did the prawn linguine  The lesson here is to not eat there if you are veggie    The service was poor  having to chase up the orders  they never did bring me the jug of tap water I requested twice  We didn t pay the   service charge that had been added to the bill    For a Sunday it was quiet  a few other tables eating  by no means busy and a lot of spare tables   says it all really  
neutral;A group of  of us went mid week for lunch  Got seated quickly with menus and drinks sorted  Menu sounded lovely and lots of choices  Received our drinks quickly enough  Mains came quickly enough and then it went downhill thereafter  I found the dish I had chicken was slightly over done as if it had been  reheated  so the edges were dry and the tomato sauce it came with  was dry  too  So  the combination was not good but could have been  We then had quite a long wait from being asked if we wanted to look at the dessert menu  but then was forgotten about so had to re request the dessert menu  Other diners were leaving and tables were not being cleared  so it looked rather a mess  as if a bomb had gone off in the dining area   not good  at all   There only seemed to be one waitress  a lot were on the sick and if it was not for this waitress  the meal could have been a disaster   so well done Cerys for helping us  The experience could be made a lot better if there were more waiting staff  This really could help a lot so please have more waiting staff available 
neutral;A great resturant to take the kids  plenty of space  not worried about kids being too noisy as there were other families with little ones :   The only problem is took an hour to get our food after ordering and the portion sizes appear on the small size  So if you are really hungry  you will need to be ordering more spending more 
neutral; This place could be fantastic with a bit more attention to detail and better quality food  Or same quality food for half the price   We went here for a meal after having it recommended to us  The pm sitting was full so we went for the earlier sitting  The walk up to the restaurant plane is impressive  they furniture is lovely and despite there only being one other table occupied there was a pleasant atmosphere  I ordered pate to start with which I thought was very small considering it was just under a fiver  Then had surf and turf which was supposed to be fillet steak  I only like fillet steak as is lean but this one was a funny shape and full of fat  The prawns were over cooked and tiny considering they were advertised as king prawns  I was so disappointed  My partner s meal was OK  he had the mixed grill and there was a good selection of meat  The waitress asked if our food was ok and i did explain that I couldn t eat mine and she said she would have a word with the chef  She offered us complimentary coffee or deserts as a way of compensation but we declined  I had wine left to drink and we didn t fancy a desert  I presumed they wouldn t charge us for the meal as a gesture like would be common practise in any other decent restaurant but the meal was charged for in the bill  I asked if they could knock the price of the meal off the bill as I didn t eat it and she said she would ask the manager  He came over and was very nice and apologetic but still wouldnt take the meal off the bill and considering this cost us    plus    for side order I though was out of order  He did mention that the chef was off that night so perhaps it ws just bad luck  And he did give us a   voucher off a meal if we return but we won t   So to summarise  it s different  If it was a cafe serving coffee and teacakes I wouldnt mind paying a bit extra to sit on a plane but as an expensive restaurant I can think of a dozen other places I d rather go  
neutral; Visited Prezzo in August  Lovely waterside position in Royal William Yard  We sat outside in the sunshine and there is a nice atmosphere  It was lunch time on a Thursday and despite there being plenty of people outside there were very few inside so not ridiculously busy  We ordered five meals and sat enjoying drinks in the sunshine  Unfortunately we waited at least  minutes between our starter and main course which was disappointing  The waitress was apologetic about the delay  and  when our meals came   they were delicious and well presented  Prices were upper limits for type of food served  however we probably would not have noticed if there hadn t been such a long wait  Would give it another try but they need to get their staffing issues sorted out quickly  
neutral; I visited the restaurant a couple of weeks ago on a Friday night  The wait staff were friendly and efficient  I had the fish and chips  my partner had the game pie  Both were nice dishes and reasonably priced  Decor is also lovely  
neutral; Just ordinary no more no less staff very friendly and helpful and willing to please food could have done with being a little hotter 
neutral;The service was Excellant and the waitress was really helpful and deserved the tip not the food  The food very poor  The cabbage was dirty  the mash lumpy and the broccoli hard  The pie lovely  The beetroot tart was all pastry dry and the new potatoes with nothing on them to help with the overall dryness  Used to be far better  The vintage one in Castleton is now far better  What a shame
neutral;for a spur of the moment unplanned trip  our afternoon tea was quite good  Reasonably priced and well presented  The staff were fairly friendly  we were told to go to the till  give our table number and the afternoon tea will be brought to us  The pot of tea with leaves was brought after a short while  no tea strainer or pot of water  We requested this and it was brought but no apology  The sandwiches were okay but nothing special  there was a delightful fresh fruit pastry which was delicious but the individual Victoria sandwich was too sweet and a bit stodgy for my taste  We enjoyed the treat but it wasn t the best afternoon tea I have enjoyed 
neutral; My Grandad had booked this for us to come and eat all we want for  price   Adults and  Child  The beer was canned  not sure if the draught was off or that is what they use  all the drinks were bought to us  We only noticed on the way out cans of fosters by the bar  We ordered our starters  starter was missing but we didn t complain as there was plenty to eat  the Duck came which was lovely but not enough pancakes too duck  The mains came and we had a dish we hadn t ordered and we were missing a main dish  The main meals we thought were a lot nicer than the starters  We did tell the staff member that we were missing a main but we would eat the strange  they had given us  There were  members of staff and for a Saturday night it was not busy  I would not liked to have been there had it of been busy  The restaurant is situated on a duel carriageway so not so child friendly  The dÇ¸cor of the restaurant was a bit tired and old fashioned    Overall not too bad  We have had much better Chinese else were  
neutral; We went to Midsummer House to celebrate a special occasion  The evening started well and the food was delicious  All the staff  except one  were attentive and polite  The Maitre D  being the large French man  whom others have mentioned  ruined the evening by being rude to our party  He stated that we would be begging him to return to the restaurant  That is where he is very wrong  I raised the matter  by letter  with Daniel Clifford  but a month later there has been no response  Very poor customer service  We are so spoilt with lovely places to eat in Cambridge that I certainly wouldn t return to be insulted  Alimentum and Coto are by far a more pleasurable and comfortable experience  
neutral; We ve been using Tale of Spice for a while now and ordering food to be delivered  Their food isn t the cheapest in the Chippenham area but they do have quite a varied menu and the food and service had previously been very good   HOWEVER  on the last two occasions we ve had lengthy waits for our food and we ve had to phone to find out where our food was  On one occasion the online ordering system advised us up to  hour and it was around hrs before we got our takeaway delivered  The second and most recent occasion it was about  mins when the website advised  mins   The other thing that bugs me slightly is why they put a charge on for paying by card  And I don t mean paying by a credit card  it s any debit card    I think we re going to be looking for an alternative indian takeaway or revert to one in the town that s been established for years  
neutral;A very pleasant premises  Staff quite attentive and pace of meal serving was right  The starter of pate was excellent  but very rich  Mains were ravioli with ricotta   spinach and Milanese di pollo  The ravioli filling was quite tasty  but the crumbed chicken was dry and the green salad wilted  It required some type of sauce to lift it and make more palatable  One could have chosen some side dishes to complement the main course  but the portions were generous   I could not have eaten more  Also  the cost would have risen considerably with extra side dishes  I did comment on the dish and the waiter was perturbed that things hadn t been right   offered a free dessert or coffee  We had the set price  course menu   glass of wine on offer with it  and I thought that was a reasonable cost  Individual dishes worked out quite expensive  I might return to try something different 
neutral;I have visited here on numerous occasions for breakfast and I love the setting  especially on a warm day when you can sit outside and enjoy the uninterrupted views across Swanage bay with a very yummy Full English or Sausage Bap  my two favourite choices  The staff are very friendly  welcoming and eager to cater for any dietary requirements in my experience  I don t have a bad thing to say about it  just very average facilities but expected in a little place such as this 
neutral; We went here for a family tea and the kids like to play and sit outside  We ordered food and it was not brilliant  Salad leaves were not the freshest and the jacket potato s we ordered were hard in the middle and seemed like they had been done in the microwave  Shame as we have eaten here before and couldn t fault the food  Will probably try again  
neutral; I do love the quirkiness of the Canteen and the food is always delicious but     Every time I have visited I have ended up clearing the dirty table myself  even after it sitting there for  mins and then asking someone to come clear it  The woman walks past me  cloth and spray in hand  and starts nattering to the people lounging on the back sofas for five mins  then walks back past me  still ignoring the dirty plates  she eventually remembers and clears half of them  The other half got cleared when my food turned up  Not hygienic or good customer service guys  especially when the food is so expensive   Maybe consider hiring more staff  
neutral; Visited Rayleigh Harvester with my family in October  We usually go to the Harvester in Shoebury  but it was closer this time  This was a bit of a disappointment  The salad bar was half empty  corn very watery  the coleslaw salad spoon handler was full of mayo and it s made my hand covered with mayo  Small roll  especially the brown one was stone hard  We didn t finish eating our salad the main was out already  The main was OK  My chicken was a bit cold  My son s fish goujouns was half unbattered hence the fish was fried and was extremely dry  I probably will not visit again  Sorry 
neutral; I have been a few times in this restaurant and here you can find probably the best non hipster pizza in Shoreditch  There are two types of dough  and I would recommend the Neapolitan one  if you like your pizza thick and soft   However  on our last visit we had difficulties finding a pizza to order as several ingredients were out of stock  including   alas   the Neapolitan dough    
neutral; The service is just OK with OK food in an OK setting  Could be so much better  Needs better service for sure  
neutral; Stopped here for tea whilst staying at the holiday inn just round the corner    What can I say It s a basic cheap eatery    But the service was friendly and a good choice on the menu Food was nice and huge portions xx  You get what you see xx no frills but good food would recommend if you ve had a long day at Harry Potter as the bus stops  mins away X 
neutral; We went to The Saxon Mill last Friday lunchtime and decided to sit on the upstairs balacony overlooking the river as it was a beautiful day  It was empty upstairs but busy downstairs as they had an offer of two pizzas for   in the bar  but we decided we would rather pay bit more and sit upstairs  The tables on the balcony were not very clean and felt a bit sticky probably from the nearby trees  We ordered our drinks which were a little expensive  but fine and then I had the brushetta with tomatoes and red onions  which was lovely and my husband had soup  the soup didn t come with bread and we weren t given any on arrival  as we had done before  but he said it was very nice  Then we both had pizzas  which were as thin as crisps and mine was burnt on the outside and wasn t up to it s usual standard  when we complained we were immediately offered us a round of drinks free  so they knew it wasn t right  We probably won t go again for a while and hopefully it will get back to it s usual standard by then  
neutral; The take away service was good  but oh dear  fish was fresh  potato good  but soaked in oil  all one could taste was oil  Tried to absorb with kitchen towel  soaked in oil  Verdict  only thing that would explain this was oil not up to temperature and therefore absorbed by what should have been good fresh produce  Result  soggy chips  crispy very oily batter  not good at all  What a shame  We live on the south coast  near Hastings  and are used to the most superb fish and chips  This was a huge disappointment  Only went there because of reviews  Perhaps Sunday evening is a bad time  
neutral; We wanted to try more of the menu after sampling a dish of theirs at Sefton park food fest   First impression  spacious but still cosy   Drinks and food order taken in good time and service was warm and friendly   We shared  tapas between the two of us   Would ve liked our food to be a little hotter  but all dishes were tasty  We left satisfied but not overly full   May return for the midweek deal as it was a little on the expensive side for the size of the dishes    
neutral; I wasn t quite sure what to expect from Zizzi  I chose a classic Margherita and it s an average British pizza  Being Italian I can say that there is some improvement to be done  However  my girlfriend s pizza rustica was great  crispy and with good toppings  I liked the place and the atmosphere  We waited a while to order our desserts  All in all  a good choice  
neutral; Treated a friend as a birthday present   We had both heard fantastic comments about the tea room and we couldn t wait to go   When we first arrived everything was great   although we weren t asked what fillings we would like in our sandwiches   we had booked the party menu  The food arrived and looked very nice and we were reminded we could have free tea refills  When we asked for a refill the staff were pleasant and obliged but when the tea came it was very weak as though hot water had just been poured onto the old teabags   The afternoon passed very quickly and my friend and I had lots to talk about   We were sat in the tea room for a couple of hours and we were made to feel as though we had out stayed our welcome and we should finish and go as our table was needed   Not very good customer relations   I will not recommend this tea room to any of my friends   When we left no one said thank you and we hope you both enjoyed your afternoon   If its an issue how long people stay  then the staff should make you aware of this instead of looking over and then offering to box what you still have left to eat   Have been to several tea rooms and had a much nicer experience   Will never return   
neutral; We live in Stow  so pretty much know how good each of the restaurants are  It was a busy Sunday today  so this was the only place we could get a table  so we knew we were likely to have fairly average food  Unfortunately  we got what we expected and also were more disappointed than normal  On arrival  wanting a table seemed to be a hassle for the staff  who really couldn t raise a smile  We were told that they d prefer us to order our drinks at the bar as it was easier for them  previously they ve taken irders at the table  and it took quite some time to be served  The food was very average and we were surprised by the high prices of the food and drink for what you got  even though we d been here before    Others had problems with the service including having to go to the bar to pay as it took too long to wait to be noticed  clearing tables seemed to be troublesome even when they were returning from taking orders and walking straight past the dirty tables  One couple even walked out having refused their roast beef twice  All in all they didn t cover themselves in glory and whilst food is normally average you can typically expect better service here  This hasn t changed our view about the fact that we d only go to the Talbot when we re stuck for other places in Stow  
neutral;We were staying nearby and had researched on the net pubs restaurants close by to have dinner this one was chosen after seeing the home cooked food and extensive menu   Upon arrival around  pm were told the quiz was starting in  minutes but maybe a meal could be sorted out Went straight through to the restaurant part of the pub to find we were the only  people in there but told the lady in charge don t worry we know the kitchen is closing soon but have already chosen from the menu online  her reply was new owners took over  weeks ago and here is our new menu  not impressed  about  items on it all with chips   ok we ate as too hungry to drive anywhere else but would not go back as no variety and presentation only acceptable 
neutral; my wife was put off by another customer scowling sat in the entrance before she had even entered  The bar is cramped when full  We were told they had to shuffle bookings round to fit us in but when we arrived most of the tables were empty and remained so  The food was uninspiring and very overpriced  I agree with comment below  quot pretentious quot  The food on wooden boards  the fries in baskets  but the most annoying thing the service  we were attended by no less than five different staff and they spent there time hovering  cutlery glasses plates all collected in a fussy manner  couldn t have a conversation  We wont return  
neutral; Booked a table on the week day whoever I spoke to made me feel she was doing me a favour and fitting us in as she was humming and arrhing  food choice is good  but again the barmaid same one who took my booking I think  we found to be a little off hand when we asked a question about the bitter they sold and made us feel like we were a nuisance for asking  would we go back  I don t think so  I like to feel welcome  within  minutes of arrival the place was not even half full so don t know what the problem was in booking a table  The food was very nice and the other staff very pleasant I would give it  stars  
neutral; Went to tratoria on Wednesday night with friends for a meal after long day at work  Also we were curious to try another Italian restaurant yet so much  quot better quot   It was not better  sadly  The burger we ordered had a tiny bit of pancetta on it that I needed magnifying glass to see it  Also my carbonara was way over seasoned  so salty I ve ate only pasta leaving all pancetta aside and my friends sea food pasta wasn t great either over cooked prawns didn t give much satisfaction  Putting not great food aside it s worth to mention our server   he was very nice and attentive  Only one thing though   maybe it would be good to let people know that meatball starter or charcuterie board doesn t come with bread  so people would know to order some next time  
neutral; Good old fashioned fish   chips   Good cuppa tea and Kids were happy with the ice cream too    Friendly staff  Nice clean comfortable surroundings  
neutral; food is very over priced but the cafe was clean and tidy   cafe was ok to just grab a cuppa but too expensive to eat in 
neutral; Come here quite often with friends  usually is quite good but disappointed this time  I ordered Ham egg and chips and specifically asked the question if the ham was a roast or boiled gammon joint    proper ham   and requested and that it wasn t squashed Pig pre sliced rubbish   I was assured it wasn t and sadly that is exactly what I got on the plate  My friend ordered cider sausages with mustard mash and she was presented with sausage chips and beans when she said that this wasn t what she ordered the waitress took the plate back and she was given the same sausages  ok fair enough  but on a mound of watery mashed potato a few peas and bad gravy it was supposed to have a flavoured gravy and mustard mash    not wanting to send it back a second time she ate it  It wasn t very good  We did make our point   they were very good and she didn t have to pay for her meal but    I think a little attention to detail wouldn t go amiss    staff were lovely  Couldn t fault them  
neutral;food was ok not the best i have tasted  staff were freindly and helpful very busy would recommend go early if eating in here
neutral; Came here on Monday to sample the new menu with the other half  We typically have  steak Mondays  so were pleased to see the steak on the Lunch Menu  Starters were lovely  I opted for Flat Breaded Mushrooms  they were lovely   you get a lot more then you used to  Boyfriend got Nachos  was rather yummy   sooo many  Main for me was very disappointing  Opted for Mussles   Chips   the mussles were dry  one wasn t opened and you only get a handful  Wish I went for steak as boyfriend was very happy  Since the re vamp it looks loads better in there  hopefully next time I will learn my lesson and stick with what I know  
neutral; We went on a Saturday evening  planning to have a drink before our dinner and had a table booked for pm  Service in the bar was excellent  as were the cocktails  We enjoyed our food in the main: the chicken liver pate and the scallops we had for starters were very good  though we had to order extra bread  My sea bass baked in salt  my sister s swordfish  my partner s steak and my cousins moules were also very good  Unfortunately  the new potatoes I had ordered came late  and were cold when they did arrive  so were sent back  A second portion was also cold  also sent back  and cancelled  Disappointingly  there was no apology  The restaurant has an open kitchen  and the smell can get a bit overpowering as it gets very busy  I could also see straight into the scullery from my seat  as the door was wedged open  presumably for the convenience of staff  but the view became rather off putting as the evening progressed  We waited twenty minutes with the dessert menus and in the end asked for our bill as no one had shown any interest in taking our order  Wine prices are on the high side  and we did have three bottles between us  Nevertheless I was left feeling that the whole experience was not worth the almost   it cost us  and I doubt we will be going back  
neutral; First time here  walked in a small homely place  smiley faces behind the bar  wasnt busy really   asked for table for   sat down got drinks promptly  good selection of food  we chose the roast   lamb for me and beef for my partner  look lush  the beef was yummy  lamb was yummy unfortunately i had a lot of fat on my plate   pointed it out to waitress  chef saif its cause its a leg |  hmm    they were very helpfull   offered a drink i turned it down as i wasnt moaning just poitning out so they knew for future  being a chef myself    the roast potatoes were amazing    so was dissapointed only having  on the plate   the veg was fresh and very nice  we had dessert   i had cheese board   cant go wrong with it  very nice   partner had dark chocolate cheesecake    looked lush and he said it was very rich but lovely   all in all its a lovely little place and serves well cooked food a little expensive though    for one roast dinner    
neutral; The last couple of times we have been to Chiquito the service has been quite slow  It can take up to an hour to get any food if not longer  The service when it arrives is good but they just need more staff overall  I believe it has got better over the last couple of months but I still believe they need more staff due to the popularity of the restaurant  The food is tasty and the prices are not too high so generally a good place to eat if you are willing to wait around for a while  
neutral; Visited here with friends  first it was hard to find a parking space  restaurant very busy  did not like the lay out  tables too close together  and all in a row  not very intimate if you are visiting as a couple  Food to a high standard  but small portions  Waiting staff helpful  Doubt we would visit again though 
neutral;You can t fault the location or the staff at the restaurant  From the moment we arrived they were exceptionally helpful and attentive  The menu is good but sadly none of the dishes matched expectation  There were four of us for dinner and one of my companions had the chicken wings starters which he said were good  The rest of us had the asparagus with poached egg but this was a bit watery  Mains were chicken  which was a bit dry  a homemade beef burger which was a little tasteless and two average steaks  We did have a four bottles of wine over the course of the evening but no one was quite expecting a bill quite as high as    Really wouldn t have minded paying that much for four if the food had been good but that s a lot for a distinctively average meal 
neutral; From the outside the restaurant looks lovely  i visited first for a xmas meal with work colleagues  This visit was ok  food ok although im not a great lover of roast dinner from restaurants  My nd visit was for my birthday meal   i was quite disappointed as was my group  I booked a month in advance for a table of  and was pleasantly surprised when they said they could cater for my large family  most places i phoned would not book us  upon arrival i found we had been squashed in a corner  space was very tight  one of the reasons i wanted to book this restaurant was the size of it  So that is my first disappointment   we wanted to order some drinks only to be told by the waitress she was not looking after our table   we waited a further  minutes to be served    by the most miserable lady   a smile cost nothing  Menu was standard  chicken  pasta  burgers  pizza which is what i expected  another reason i wanted to dine here as pleasing  people   of which are children  is difficult  However when the food arrived on a wooden board i was instantly put off  Yes it looks nice but think of the germs  All but  people in my party did not enjoy their meal  It was weatherspoon standard but at expensive prices   yet another disappointment   My sisters little boy also spilt a drink  which sometimes can happen and its not a big deal   but according to our waitress it was an inconvenience to ask for some blue roll tissue   she rolled her eyes and walked off without saying a word  A waiter returned with something to clear it up with and he was very very nice even got us a replacement drink   to sum up my experience   service was awful  food was ok nothing special and not worth the price  i more than likely wouldn t return  
neutral; This review is potentially unfair as we went on a Monday night but we found it to be very average  The menu was extensive and my view would be to cut this back and focus on a few key things  It felt like the whole dinner was really rushed  The staff are pleasant and the interior is nice enough but the food is just not that great  
neutral; Recently stayed in watford for the Harry potter tour and needed a lunch stop when we d got back from the tour  the pub was in a good location right next to the train station  as soon as you step off the Harry potter bus and just around the corner from our hotel  The staff seemed ok and the food was ok too  nothing special   
neutral; Think we visited in  early and I was not impressed how things were that trip  However I can say we went back  I had chicken fajita and my partner burger  Are meal orders we re taken quick and food soon followed  We give food  out of ten and we would visit again  Best time to eat there is pm pm time later it s just hectic and not enough staff to cover there tables 
neutral; Great to sit outside  however the service left a lot to be desired  You have to fetch the menu s  then back inside and wait to order  Then you are told to collect your own cutlery  condiments and napkins  We waited ages  and the two Fish Pies ordered had to be returned as they were cold  This seems to be a recurring complaint   After we had long finished we had to go inside and ask for the table to be cleared  ready for our sweets  The price of the meals and drinks  are only justified by the superb venue  
neutral; We initially went on a Groupon voucher  which was alright but very uninspiring so  when we reluctantly returned for a family birthday  not my choice  I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt   The decor and atmosphere is very tatty and uninspiring but that would not matter if food was good  And the fish tank is very  s  not in a retro way  My Bruschetta was buttered Ciabatta with cold uncooked cherry tomatoes  a few strips of basil and no olive oil or garlic  not at all authentic or tasty  I then ordered linguine and was not offered a spoon with which to eat it  fundamental to eat that kind of pasta   Not one if our party had a dessert  most unusual but nothing inspired   There was some reference on the menu to  Eccy Road   never would a Sheffielder refere to it as that  always Ecclesall Road  so again  a point against it   Most of my party thought it ok but will never return 
neutral; On a lovely June evening this  Gastropub  promised much with it s position by the river and pleasant interior but unfortunately the food did not match either of these  The menu recommends that the rump steak tastes best if you have it cooked medium rare so when you order this dish and ask that it be cooked medium rare you expect that the steak you are served will be medium rare  The fact that the steak presented was more medium to well done meant that it was no where near as good as it should of been  If someone had bothered to check how happy we were with our meal  we could of passed on the comments directly  
neutral; After a long walk down and then back up from the beach at the base of the castle  we found this cafe a welcome retreat for a rest  Situated in a most lovely location  we entered the cafe which was deserted of staff at the serving hatch  After taking a seat  we had to endure a few minutes wait before one of us had to ask if anybody was serving  The assistant cleaning the tables had to call for somebody  who then appeared from the back  Despite this delay  the tea and cheese scones we had were really lovely and people could also access just water if they wanted  We did also notice however that people generally did have a fairly long wait to be served when the queue got longer  
neutral;This pub is full of character and charm  On the downside whilst the meals are nice hy are vastly overpriced an there fore we would not reurn here  We went at lunchtime and it was quite crowdedThere is a large free car park at the side 
neutral; My husband took me to this restaurant for a Valentine s meal  Despite the fact that we had booked we waited for an hour to be seated at our table which wouldn t have been so bad if there had been any kind of acknowledgement  The staff were very friendly but some seemed a little out of their depth on such a busy night  The food was good but we seemed to be forgotten when it came to service  I had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant so believe it may have been a victim of its own success  I would like to try again on not such a busy occassion  
neutral;Food was really nice  lovely restaurant but staff rush you through all the meal and you don t feel relaxed    Would not recommend it s like going to a fast food restaurant 
neutral; We treated ourselves to a taster menu at Benedicts for a special birthday meal after seeing The Great British Menu  I had emailed regarding the reservation and requested a pescatarian menu  The communication via email was good and very helpful    When we arrived at the restaurant the welcome wasn t great and we were left waiting a short while  The staff seemed unaware that we d pre ordered the pescatarian menu and bought over the main taster menus including the meat dishes  I then mentioned this and was then brought the vegetarian  not pescatarian  so again had to request this  For some reason both vegetarian and pescatarian menus are both labelled  vegetarian  hence the confusion  After been given the wine list we were left waiting for another  minutes  and still no one came over  In the end I had to call one of the waitresses over to our table who seemed very put out   The meal started well  with the Butternut Squash VeloutÇ¸  which was very tasty  The second dish was spaetzle  something I d never heard of    this was my least favourite dish and seemed very bland  The two fish courses  river trout and skate wing  were both very good  as was the famous Nanny Bush s trifle   So all in all the food was good  and the wine too  But for the money I would have expected better service  It just seemed like the restaurant needed a good maÇ©tre d   rather than being run by too many  unorganised young staff  
neutral;Very dissapointing  Have been to the actual Hotel several times in the past  This was our first visit to the Beach restaurant  Not at all what I expected from this venue   Very limited menu  Mainly fish  The meal itself was nothing special  It was however very expensive    In my opinion this venue is probably more suitable for a coffee and cake stop    We will not be returning 
neutral; For some reason the Lakeside have changed the house wine from Hardys to Three Mills and it is absolutely disgusting and can be purchased at Tesco for    a bottle  It is a British wine and of very poor quality I can t understand why they are serving such rubbish and why I was not offered any replacement without charge  Instead I had to buy another  bottles for the friends I was with  The oldest waitress was  as usual  very unhelpful However the young waitresses were very efficient  
neutral; Love the outside sitting space and the conservatory but the food is average  We had the Fish and Chips  its a huge portion but the fish was really tasteless   disappointing when your right next to the sea 
neutral; Booked a Christmas meal for me and  friends from college on the th of December  As we are   we don t have a lot of money and want the best from it we can get  We pre ordered the meal and asked for special prep we did get them We arrived at the restaurant and we were seated and left for over  minutes not even seeing a waiter  So I asked for our free glass of prosecco  which took even longer as we went away and came back asking if we wanted drinks  which we would have asked for before We got our prosecco eventually and asked for water which took another  minutes  Our starters arrived which was antipasti to share  didn t even get a check back or anything  They cleared our plates and mains arrived after a lengthy wait  must say was lovely and didn t still get a check back  The desserts were disappointing I had a lemon tart which was ok The tiramisu was to strong and sloppy and the chocolate pud was alright  The service was awful again and asking for the bill took forever  The bill eventually came and they had only take p of when I paid a   deposit   we paid and left  ok when quiet but when busy appalling  
neutral; Well when you order a takeaway you expect to get what you ordered dont you Well in my case i did not being on a weight loss programme i have not had a carry out for months but been as i was just back from hols thought i would treat myself really shouldnt have bothered With my meal which was really greasy i had ordered and paid for pashmari nan bread what i got was a cold plain nan bread petty perhaps but this was in effect my last supper 
neutral;We were looking forward to this  as we hadn t eaten in Chelsea that much and we heard great things  First of all  it took an extremely long time for them to bring us the drinks  got them after two of our starters   Then we all started feeling ignored   even though we were basically sat in the middle of the restaurant   Second of all  service in general took a very long time   too long for the amount of money we were paying   Positives: The food was very tasty and of high quality    The restaurant itself was so lovely and beautiful   In the end we refused to pay the service charge as it was a ridiculous experience   will not be venturing here again soon : 
neutral; It was a lovely hotel and the staff were lovely  however the room itself was situated on the main road so from am lorries  buses etc were full on and it was SO noisy  For   a night I think it was a lot of money when I wasn t able to sleep really  
neutral; Heard so many bad things about this but never had any bad experiences  Staff always helpful  food is tasty  great ppace to take your kids as they have soft serve ice cream only bad thing u can serve urself wit the soft serve machine and some children go wild Depending on how busy tables dont take to long sometimes u dont have to wait for one  Overall lovely atmosphere great view of the boating lake and fine food  
neutral; went here for breakfast this morning  was greeted quite friendly and took a seat on the comfy seats further to the back of the cafe  i asked if i could change the black pudding for an egg or something else the waitress just responded with NO  how friendly the breakfast was ok but i would say only the beans could be described as hot  to say we paid    i think we would have been better to have paid    and gone to the weatherspoons across from the hotel  i dont feel i should have been charged the full amount for my breakfast either since i didnt have the black pudding and nothing was given to make up for the amount of money i had removed from my plate   yesterday we came here for a coffee and a cake i think save your money from the breakfast and go elsewhere but for a cake n coffee it would be ok  
neutral; We counted  Porches winding their way around the narrow streets of the very pretty harbour village of Rye and the Mermaid Inn is the kind of restaurant their owners would probably frequent    There are some very good things about it  The building itself is beautifully historic with black wood beams and stone fireplaces  spoilt slightly by tacky silver mirrors and a gas fire instead of real wood   The food was also good and well presented  However  given the formality of the setting and the price we paid  there was also some disappointments  We felt rushed through our courses   one plate cleared before we had even finished eating only to have the next course slapped down immediately  The service also felt stuffy  occasionally pretentious and at times almost sarcastic  We were also mislead on what was included in the price we paid    For such an expensive meal I expected something fantastic  and I am afraid I came away a little disappointed  
neutral; We ate here on a Friday night  We chose the daily specials which were fine although the prices were not advertised and they proved to be quite a bit more expensive than we expected  Nothing to complain about really in terms of taste and presentation  The desserts were not so impressive  My wife did not enjoy her tiramisu but to their credit they did not charge us for it  I thought this was excellent public relations  We would eat here again but would take more care about what we chose to eat  su 
neutral; Don t really know where to start with this review  Booked here pre theatre   There was a theatre menu which my partner had  Food was alright but sat down at   and by   had eat  out of  of my courses  Being honest thought it was pre cooked and warmed in microwave  Atmosphere and staff were lovely with food standard aside as was the bar side was really good  I would recommend for a drink but unfortunately not for food  Regret that I have to give a bad review because everything was good  decor  staff etc  just food was a let down  
neutral; Very nice food  the double cream mash potato left a lot to be desired but all in all it was a good meal  My only major gripe was the fact that this restaurant doesn t have a baby change   The children s meal was huge and there was no toddler or baby meals on offer  The high chair had no straps so my daughter was constantly trying to get out and explore the fascinating items on the dinner table  If you are out as adults then I would recommended but not if you have a baby or toddler with you  
neutral; My wife and I like Froggies  The atmosphere  the super food  and very friendly staff  However  the very friendly staff do not really have much of a clue when it comes to service  We were shown to our table and left  No menu  no enquiry as to whether we would like a drink  Meanwhile some people who arrived after us were receiving great attention  I had to ask for the menus which came  but still no offer of any drink or the provision of bread rolls etc  I went to the bar to ask for a couple of G Ts which the waitress then tried to deliver to another table we felt somewhat unwanted  Anyway the Sunday lunch was gorgeous and my pudding supreme  The welcoming owner needs to get a grip on his staff and tell them how a restaurant should be run  
neutral;The pub is amazing  very beautiful  But the restaurant which serves Thai food is very disappointing  I know because I am Thai  I ve been to a lot of thai restaurants in london that serves much better food than here  Everything on the menu is westernised and super sugary  Would not recommend eating here if you want authentic thai food  The waiters were all Thai so i was surprised they didn t serve something more authentic 
neutral; Nice place to eat and shopping availiable such as cotton traders I shop here often and my grandma buys most of her plants from here   
neutral; The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere  It s very small and intimate and has a great vibe with reggae music playing  The booking system is not great  You can only add yourself to the waiting list via the app and maximum table is   You can t ring and book a table  If the app shuts down   which happened to us  they tell you that you have to go back on the waiting on list again from the start  Being from the Caribbean the portion sizes for the mains weren t that big  Some dishes are overpriced and others are reasonable  Had an enjoyable time but won t be rushing back there anytime soon  
neutral; went for tea on saturday although there is still a lots of room for improvement the food was hot  the staff were friendly and smiles thats a plus for me  i think the managers name was andy he was very proffesional  friendly and nothing was to much trouble thats another plus  i do feel the pub needs a paintover  i have read some of the reviews and feel that some are a little harsh  dont we need to support or loose our pubs  anyway i feel there is only one way to go and that is upwards so here is for more improvements  i am going again in a couple of weeks so i will let you know how i get on  cheers chesney 
neutral;A really bustling atmosphere and reasonably priced drinks  Very convient as we were going to the empire theatre  Managed to get served quite quickly despite there being a lot of people around the bar 
neutral; Certainly not the best Chinese I ve eaten  Kept thinking wish I hadn t bothered  The fried rice was more like boiled rice with some strands of egg sprinkled in  And I ve woken up with a nasty migraine which must be from the excess use of MSG    Staff were friendly  You win some you loose some  
neutral; me and my family live in the area and visit here fairly regular  food is great  however there is never enough bar staff on duty  there is one duty manager who i care not to mention who is very rude to there staff  i found it very off putting  
neutral;My husband and I visited this restaurant while on a short business trip  It was on what seemed a busy Thursday night  although we had not pre booking the host Rod was very accommodating and made us welcome by providing a table in the bar area In order for us to eat  although not perfect he really went out of his way to assist and even provided bread and olives free of charge while we waited  We found both Rod and Aly the hosts of this establishment very sociable  Rod providing sample tasting prior to buying ad Aly filling us in on her bag and jewellery nights  I must say however  the latter not to my personal taste  I chose not to have a starter  my husband had the garlic mushrooms  unfortunately he found them to be very bland in fact just like fried mushrooms without the garlic on a bed of lettuce  I chose the fillet steak cooked medium  sadly when it came it was well done at one end and med well at the other  the peppercorn sauce was cold  My husband chose the seafood platter rather greedily for  unfortunately when it arrived it was more like a portion for   he found it a little disappointing  not really the seafood you normally get other than the  mussels  plenty of lettuce again and quite a lot of smoked salmon made up most of the plate  Our desserts were caramel and the chocolate gateaux  both average  The presentation of the food could be improved  however the overall very affordable cost does reflect in the quality  you do get what you pay for  if you want high class cuisine then you need to visit a different establishment  I have read all the complimentary comments which have been written regarding this restaurant and do agree with many  however I have tried to give and honest and personal view of our visit and hope this helps other travellers ad visitors who frequent the restaurant 
neutral; It was nice food  and the ramen was lovely and filling  Found the staff a little off putting  saying we couldn t have a table because we hadn t booked and then asking another member of staff who showed us to a table straight away  If you get little bits and bobs off the menu  you can easily spend   for two people  Drinks are a bit limited and the quite pricey for just bottles at Wouldn t rave about this place  yeah it s ex masterchef winner but it s not revolutionary  
neutral;Liked the hard working waitress for whom nothing could be too much trouble  Whitebait starter was good as were the nachos  Decor upstairs is very dark and pictures lack character 
neutral; went with a friend and her two granddaughters  Plenty of choice  but very disorganised   missed salads and fruit  Very busy Saturday lunch time   would be easier to make choices after a first experience  Food good quality and quite well cooked  Buffet good idea as teenagers with us faddy eaters  DÇ¸cor basic  bout place clean  Basically good value for money  
neutral; Visited for Sunday lunch  Be aware that there is a small charge for parking  There is a sign in the car park indicating that you get a refund with your first order  which we did not see until we were leaving  No refund was voluntarily offered by the staff   so don t forget to ask   Telephoned to book in advance   waste of time   had a booking for pm but was treated like a  walk in   There was no point on booking in advance  Waited  mins for a table  Once you get a table the service is rushed  They are clearly pushing for a quick turnaround and don t hide this   If you choose soft drink with unlimited top up your empty glass will be plonked on the table and you are directed to a self service dispenser   they don t even do first fill for you  Food is good for a chain carvery  portions generous  vegetables were well cooked  Good service is important to me and I did not find it at Toby Carvery Cleadon  
neutral;This is the second time we have been to Noori s and unfortunately the last  The first time people were queuing out the door and when we got a table we waited  mins to be served  By this time we decided they couldn t cope and we went up the road to A very quiet Jazz Indian restaurant  oh how the tables have turned  We booked on table Pouncer for Friday night  Food was really good  bit limited on choice and nothing out of the ordinary was on offer  What we ordered was tasty  Not many people in there which was a surprise based on our last experience  Got the bill and they hadn t discounted the tablepouncer offer  Then I saw the price of the wine a glass and a tiger beer was WOW we don t mind paying for a nice glass of something and have paid more  but in a little Indian restaurant it s clearly a RIP OFF I questioned how they can justify the prices and he said it was the managers decision  It s clear that they can t keep up with competition and inflate the drink prices to cover their losses  In the words of Jessie j   it s not about the money money    It s the principle 
neutral; The pub had a good atmosphere and was very interesting  However my partner and I thought the food was a little overpriced  We both had fish and chips which was around   but the batter was very soggy  That was the only complaint otherwise it was very nice  
neutral; Hmm  Not really impressed on first visit  All tables needed clearing when we looked for somewhere to sit  Staff were pleasant but the meal was well below par  We didn t have a cheap special offer but my fish   chips was definitely on the small size   my husbands steak was full of gristle  We didn t hang back for pudding or coffee   wouldn t visit again 
neutral; First visit with friends to celebrate a birthday  Car park was packed with many badly parked cars making it hard to get in and out  Although we were called to our table as our starters were ready they didnt arrive for at least another  minutes  when they did arrive  they came is dribs and drabs so by the time everyone had theirs  my soup was cold  although very tasty  Main courses looked very processed and not much sign of freshly cooked local produce  although on the whole they were tasty and not much was left  My desert was meant to be chcolate sponge although it did resemble remarkebly the chocolate brownie only difference being one was round the other square  Both were dry and the sponge was in no way spongy  Not sure I would rush back but its a nice location and ambience  
neutral; Went here for a family Sunday lunch  Being a family of  we were seated at a table in the dining room  within a few minutes we were moved to a different table that was occupied by another couple  and they moved to our table  A little odd  The carvery was nice but would have expected better to be honest  I will go back again to see if there is any improvement and If the service is better  Who knows they could of just been having a bad day   
neutral; They managed this quite easily   Was looking forward to a special mum and daughter evening  chose Napa to have dinner and cocktails only to be refused a glass of wine with my meal as I didn t have any I d    Despite being  and out with my mother who could vouch for my date of birth the manager was adament I was not   the legal age to drink wine with a meal and an adult   We decided to stay and I ordered a glass of  fresh orange  only to be served concentrated orange juice  The meal was nice  despite being able to relax with a drink or have cocktails afterwards as planned    Had I been out drinking with my friends I would have taken ID but as it was dinner with my mum  they were being far to zealous and it did spoil the evening    Also they try and sneak in the gratuity on the card payment machine    They didn t really seem to care that they lost out on a bar tab and a tip    
neutral; We had quite a large group  around    which they did accommodate which was nice  When we called on the day to confirm they said that we needed to have a set menu which we were all okay with as it would ve been a nightmare trying to have everyone order different things  It was also BYO which suited us all  It was a nice evening but the amount of food we got for what we paid was incredibly disappointing  We all paid   each and I swear I had just a few bites of curry  The only things on the table that were plentiful were rice  naan and poppadom  There also wasn t much flavour to anything  The waiters were all really nice and did put up with our drunkenness but it overall there was just a lack in amount of food and flavour and it made me feel like we were being a little bit taken advantage of  Perhaps it would ve been quite a different dining experience with a smaller group  
neutral; The Cafe Rouge in Brighton itself  which is in The Lanes  is better  At the Marina my salad was tired and the steak a little cold  although sufficiently rare  but with floppy French Fries  However the restaurant overlooks the sea and is very pleasant in itself  The service was good  For better food go to the one in town   but for the atmosphere and view this one is better  
neutral; Sat by the window with a great draught coming in  Service v slow  Food terrible  My friend who had booked it was v embarrassed especially as she had had a good experience before Christmas  Perhaps we were just unlucky but it wasn t even a particularly busy day  Ironically it even took ages to get the bill  
neutral; Recently visited as we had been given a gift voucher  The waiters lacked interest and knowledge when asked advice on the dishes   we asked  times for a jug of water  which we were charged for  and when the bill arrived we were charged for a beer  priced    which we hadn t even had  Not impressed  won t be re visiting any time soon  
neutral;I was very disappointed with this the place looks lovelly from the outside but once you get inside the decoration is not in keeping and very bland  The food is ok but not great  The staff are very good though 
neutral;Have only popped in here for a drink  the bar was pretty empty  but it was a tedious and slow process ordering the drinks   Staff seem more intent on chatting behind the bar   The food I did see  looked typical of chain pub pies burgers and chips   Nice beer garden  though  with a kids area  that looked quite good 
neutral; When this place was first open the service was terrible  We though   they justr opened this place and staff needs a bit more practice  Year or more later   the service is still TERRIBLE Firt  you wait to be seated for min  then you wait another min for your order to be taken  then another min to deliver just coffee and cake  and then another min to pay you bill  This is trully anoying and irritating  The only reason this plase got  stars from me is food   I had the best Bendict eggs ever and cakes are also damn good  But if you there just for a cake buy to take out  You will pay less and won t have to wait ages to be served  
neutral; Read the reviews and was expecting better than we got  Some of the courses were lovely eg shrimps and pate but hotpot looked over cooked and unappetising   did taste nice though  Lamb chops excessively fatty  Overall nice but won t be returning 
neutral; Me and my boyfriend decided to go here for a meal last night as it is relatively close to where we live  When we arrived we stood waiting at the door as various waitresses ignored us until someone  who I didn t realise was actually a waitress because they had no uniform on  came up to us and told us it would be a  minute wait  She then gave us this buzzing device that would buzz when our table was ready  We were very confused as she poorly described it to us but after  minutes we were seated at a table  The floor was extremely messy and we had no cutlery  salt or ketchup on the table  We already knew what food we were ordering as we had  minutes before being seated to decide  but we had to wait ANOTHER  minutes before our order was actually taken  To be fair  our food arrived pretty quickly afterwards and the quality of the food was pretty good  I was impressed with the furniture and layout of the restaurant but there were so many things that didn t need to be in there that made it look tacky  fruit machines  claw machines etc    Overall the prices of the food were relatively cheap and the food was of a good standard but I was extremely disappointed by the quality of the staff and the messiness off the restaurant inside  I recommend that you definitely should book a table before going  
neutral; Spent nearly   but didn t live up to the expectations  I ordered a chicken biriyani dish and the rice turn up to be bland and taste like plain Chinese boiled rice with chicken  They even offered a side dish which was more like left over vegetables in watery soup    Husband ordered grilled lamp chop but were not properly cook they were hard to bite and again taste wasn t greatest   A bit disappointed  
neutral;We visited here on Easter Monday after reading the great reviews but left disappointed  The staff were very friendly and could not do enough for us but the food was just average pub grub  Not great portion sizes and way over priced for what it was 
neutral; Visited Loch Fyne with my boyfriend on Friday th July  Meal booked for  pm arrived a little early but was quickly seated without any trouble  Lovely relaxed atmosphere and waiter was very friendly  My boyfriend ordered the Angus burger which looked and tasted amazing  chips were cooked to perfection  I ordered the seafood tagitelle which mainly consisted of mussels there was only  tiny baby squid and  prawn  which was a little bit of a let down  Other than that it was lovely  would I return again  Yes  but I would order something different  
neutral; We visited The Chase Gate today for lunch  It was quite busy  Its table service which was nice for a pub chain these days  Our waitress was polite and smiley  Ellie i think  The food was ok  Although it was a fair wait   but the place was heaving  Nice and clean  Pleasant little place  Worth a visit  would deffo visit again  
neutral; Have to am slightly disappointed with my last  visits  Having been since they opened the Deansgate branch   am familiar with their offerings   The whole experience is one that you should definately try  its fun  different and usually lots of different food to try   Last two visits  we have had to ask  remind and almost nag for service  You see the meat men wandering round with the lovely food   they serve one or two tables near by then walk away from everyone else   and the whole leaving the dining disc on green or red seems to have fallen by as they totally ignore it    Its a lovely venue  with lovely food   when you are actually served   so please sort out the service   Its not nice to have to ask or be ignore when the concept is table serve   Plus they have recently changed their lunch prices at the week end and during the day they now only offer  different meat choices unlike before  To have to whole experience you need to pay the evening price  Which is fine if you can actually eat what you have paid for    
neutral; Very friendly staff and our waitress was lovely  however the menu docent tell you that all the gravy is onion gravy    slight problem if you hate onions  Not overly helpful with a solution    Starts and deserts were delicious but pricey for what we had  
neutral;Been here a few times and after visiting for my annual birthday christmas meal  which was brill decided to re book  but wish we hadnt starters were lovely but then an hour wait for mains  very poor quality and couldnt wait any longer for pud so cancelled  Real dissapointed
neutral; Food was good  service was quick but waitresses need training and some manners  I don t blame the staff  they were super busy  but the owners need to invest some time and money in a little training to make your visit a little better  after all when you part with   for lunch some finesse and manners wouldn t go a miss  
neutral; The servers were lovely and could not do enough for us  The pizza I had  Neptuna  was dry  the squid was chewy  and the muscles still had their bead attached so I ended up with a mouth full of rope fibers   The week after eating at Kardomah   I saw one of the chefs outside the restaurant smoking in their chef whites  This has definitely put me off returning  
neutral; Have visited here twice now with family but won t be rushing back  The refurbishment is pleasant and the staff friendly but the food lacks finesse and in some cases was inedible  I had a prawn baguette which could have done with addition of some salad instead of the potato wedges dripping in fat which looked disgusting so I didn t attempt to try them  The one positive was the choice of portion sizes which was a good idea for those with a smaller appetite  
neutral;Had I been to Circo before I m sure things would of started out somewhat smoother  However it is unlikely I will again    My daughter and I went to the restaurant about pm on a weekday  Found a table and waited an appropriate length of time   Realising nothing was going to happen I went to the bar and queued  Got our drinks and was then informed all orders come via the bar  Returned with drinks only to find no menus on the table  Asked a waitress leaning on the end of the bar for a couple of menus  and was pointed to a box halfway down the restaurant  At this point  knowing I ve got to join the bar queue once again  I m really NOT getting the whole restaurant experience   In fact we re only a step away from one of those god awful places that gives you a pager  Right  on to the food  My daughter had a spicy chicken burger and fries  Burger was very nice  chips underdone and pale  I had gammon  eggs and chips  The gammon was superb  the chips claim to be triple cooked  which they might have been  but clearly not recently    To summarise  started off badly  never got going  was pleased to leave  
neutral; Having I checked in advance there were choices for vegetarians  I was assured that there would be at least two  There were just two    The curry was lovely  as was the goats  curd salad with beetroot  an inspired combination   The tomato sauce with the cannelloni had a charred flavour   perhaps it was meant to  but we couldn t eat it   The puddings were delightful  and the service was charming  A pleasant  but not a stunning  evening  
neutral; The food was very good value for money  the only down side was it was very warm in there And we seemed to be forgotten quite a few times 
neutral; Nice food  first time I have been to a sushi resturant and it was good  Usual pricey sushi but not actually too bad  Was a little miffed that they added an   service charge onto the bill when they didn t do much for service  the preparing kitchen part was two feet from us so all they had to do was pass it over  Everything prepared fresh  
neutral;Dont go in there anymore because there are far to many dogs  it is more like a kennel than a pub or a restaurant  I have heard the food has improved since the new owners stepped in but when i entered and sore the chef rubbing the dogs belly in the middle of the bar area I was very put off  Pub also smells bad  combination of damp and doggy stench 
neutral; Nice building  reasonable facilities  The food is edible and the staff pleasant  It won t win any awards but for a cheap evening out or for a Sunday lunch its fine  
neutral; Came here before seeing a show at the point with my friens  Wasn t busy which was nice  My friend and I ordered diet cokes which came out flat  we said we didnt want them in the end and just had water but they didnt charge us  All the food came togther and was lovely and filling  I remember it being slightly less tatsy than when it was Nashaa but still enjoyable  The staff were lovely as always though  
neutral; Couple of quibbles here   justified I think as this is a pricey venue   Very noisy probably due to abundance of hard surfaces   lack of curtains  No indication at all of gluten free options and choice limited   particularly in the pudding arena   if one has to avoid gluten  Food good but not exceptional and over priced  
neutral; Having had an excellent meal one evening I met up with a friend for lunch  I wasn t very impressed  The service was ok  The staff were pleasant enough  apparently too few  we were warned  Had to ask for the cheese on my feta and chickpea salad  The extra hot water with tea was forgotten as well  Seems to have had an off day  We can all have one and I would give it another go because I still remember that other meal  
neutral; Went here using a voucher allowing us to have   of food for   so was very good value  That being said the food wasn t anything to shout about  It was okay but not brilliant  The selection was good but the food wasn t piping hot and didn t feel fresh  Wouldn t go back and pay full price  
neutral; I have visited here several times since it s opening and enjoyed a couple of decent meals but on my last visit I was left disappointed  Not only was the food below par  the service was incredibly slow  Waited  mins before even our drinks arrived  
neutral;Went on a sunny evening and sat out the front for a drink  which was nice if a little noisy  I had asked to eat in the garden but we were shown to a table inside  The room was large and airy though  Service was friendly but a little slow  The food was variable   steak was good  a starter of stir fried vegetables didn t have enough flavour  We had a nice evening but it wasn t memorable 
neutral; This place does what it says on the tin    When you enter  the waiting staff advice you  that the food will not necessarily come out in order  Fair enough  Its good healthy fast food and somewhere you just pop in and out of    The waiting staff usually have everything organised and under control    Somethings are a bit pricey  especially starters   They do take away at the same time   which could be a good concept   but whenever i have ordered it    its never ready on collection   I enjoy eating here at least once a month    
neutral; We ended up visiting this restaurant twice during our stay in St Ives as the first experience was lovely   Our first lunch at the Ocean Grill was amazing   great service  good food etc but when we returned the next day  the experience was the complete opposite  The service was slow and confused and the food was not half as nice due the slowness of the dishes arriving and having been sat out    Overall  I wouldn t know whether to recommend this restaurant at all as the two experiences were completely different  However  plenty of other places to eat in St Ives if you don t want to take the risk  
neutral; The food was slightly dissapointing  had a better meal at The Swan  
neutral; Nice cake and coffee with a mixed clientele   couples  families  male bonding over a lager   Sandwiches and hot food  Toilets spotless  Appears to be a popular meeting place   but  not many places to meet in Saltburn  Appears to occasionally have live music   folk 
neutral; I strongly recommend the set menu  which allows to try a variety of Greek delicatessen  We were not able to try everything since we were almost full already after the starters  The place is not easy to be found since it is quite small  but the atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly  Recommended for couples  
neutral; This cafe could be really good  It s a shame some of the ingredients they use are cheap  For example the sausages  The milkshakes are served in small nasty plastic glasses and are just milk with a bit of flavoured powder stirred in  The milk wasn t even icey cold  The pastry for the pies doesn t taste good  very bland  The chips are good and the carrots tasty but the peas are rather hard  The offering of orange juice is also a bit of a letdown with the small size option not being much bigger than an egg cup  Standards of hygiene could be improved  The tables are not cleaned properly and feel sticky  The menus are the same  Attention to this detail I would recommend  Also the cutlery they bring to you is not very clean looking and the condiments on the table  again could do with a clean  Another problem is the seating arrangement  It is very cramped and you are on top of the other diners  Do not sit by a door or you will constantly have to move  A few minor and basic changes would be all this cafe needs to go from average to fantastic  Such a shame  
neutral; I ve been here a few times over the years  I think it has become somewhat faded and overpriced  I imagine it relies on its history and reputation to draw in the customers   The food was good but not amazing  It was over fussy rather than concentrating on simple  good quality ingredients   Serving staff seemed really unknowledgable  For example  it was a struggle to find out what wine came by the glass  the answer that eventually came was very little   just  choices of low quality red and white   or what cheese was served on the cheese board  I was told  quot well you are pregnant so I wouldn t recommend you eat any of it anyway quot    I heard another customer ask if the chicken was free range   the waiter wasn t sure    The atomsphere is also a little bit cold  There is no background music and a lot of waiting staff standing around    The food is good  this place just doesn t hit the spot   Finally  the toilets are pretty grim and need a good clean  
neutral; In a convenient location and offering decent food there is nothing wrong with Fleur Cafe  but it s not great either    We ordered a panini  bacon and brie  and it was quite nice however it took longer than expected to arrive    The cafe is clean but the interior is dated and tired looking  however I do not know if this is due to the recent weather conditions   If you are in Looe Fleur Cafe is convenient and reasonably priced  
neutral;My Partner and I visited here for our Valentines weekend meal after numerous good reports from our friends raving about how good it was  On arrival  I loved the decor  its fab  young  modern and the place has a good atmosphere  We were seated immediately  and offered drinks  Note that most the chairs are what you would expect to sit on in a Year  primary school classroom or a wooden bench  so if your after comfort  this probably isnt your place  we didnt mind  Our order was taken quickly and the food was delivered quickly   almost too quick to make you wander how well the food is cooked and prepared  microwaved    Unfortunately my order was wrong  having cheese allergy and asking for no cheese my meal arrived with cheese  The waiter seemed a little clueless to the previous conversation we had had about my allergy but managed to get me a new meal quite quickly  Dont waste your time on desserts unless your going all out and having the big one   we shared a cheesecake and it was a poor attempt at a pudding that cost  I could go to a shop and buy a cheesecake  cream  sauce etc for that much   definitely not value for money  Also be aware of hidden extras  as I had asked to have the cheese removed I was offered the chance to swap for something else  so I thought  and selected bacon  and also  swapped  my ordinary fries for sweet potato ones  to find out I was going to be charged extra for these at the end  Overall  a nice experience and worth a visit  food was nice when it was correct but not sure if I would make the effort and spend the money again as I could have had nicer meals for cheaper and closer to home  A shame really as I was really looking forward to this 
neutral; We went as a family of   which included a  year old  for a special birthday occasion lunch  The staff were really nice and friendly and brought colouring things for my daughter to use to keep her occupied which was nice   The menu was good for meat eaters but poor for vegetarians  I only had a main of sage  cheese and chestnut ravioli   I did ask for the chestnuts to be taken out but they were an integral part so couldn t be  And my dish of food was very bland and boring  The meat eaters enjoyed theirs   although one steak was quite fatty   Overall an ok experience   not the best but not the worst  
neutral; visited several times throughout the past year  when its quiet  its good  when its busy  I would avoid it  I actaully went here last night with my family   of us   Seated on a small table right in the walk way  Ordered our drinks and waited about  minutes for them  Took our orders straight after  Our food had then come out and I must say one of the waiters shows no emotion or any care in the world  muttered under his breathe what the foods were and instead of placing it on the table he just handed it to us  walked off without asking if we would like any sauces ect   minutes later I had asked for a large pot of tomato sauce  A tiny pot the size of a p arrived and was used by just  person  so had to ask again  food was average  i would say our chips were all left overs and just recooked in the fryer for  adults and  child with appaling service and food  not sure if i would go back  
neutral;This was the nd time we visited this pub   Restuarant   We were very disappointed with the staff in this venue  they were very disinterested when we stood at the bar we were told by other customers that the barman was upstairs  When he did appear there was no welcome   I told him that we had booked for Sunday lunch  We were told sit where you like  We waited   waited no one came to take our order  We had to ask in the end  When the food  starter  arrived it was pate served on a wooden chopping board with  tiny French toasts tiny paper pot of pickle    slices of cuecumber  The main was a choice of roast meat  Plonked on a plate   We would loved to make this quaint little pub a regular haunt  Sadly not again  
neutral;Atmosphere and ambience vibrant but food average  I really wanted some authentic italian food but it was very much the same as everywhere else  good enough but nothing to get excited about 
neutral; Been going here since it first opened  and whilst I love the venue and view  the food never quite hits the spot  The menu is quite extensive but nothing is really good  all just average with several things being poor  Staff friendly but service is slow  Apparently children are not allowed in the restaurant after pm but we did have two  very well  behaved children with us after pm because we had sat down at :pm and were still waiting for our main course to arrive at pm  For dinner they should cut the menu down to a much smaller menu but do it really really well  Unless things drastically change  won t be eating here again  
neutral; It s was ok  decor a bit dated  Staff didn t seem that interested in us only people big parties  they seemed to come across as abrupt  Food ok not bad but not great seemed bland and pizza was soggy  Wouldn t really rate it  It also seems that the manager can t seem to take critisium going off not great reveiws  mabye this is who trains staff   I think they should mabye overlook the automatic service charge  Overall an ok restaurant  
neutral;Have been going to this Toby on a Sunday for two years and have always enjoyed it  however four weeks ago when we went and had the beef it was so tough that I had to get the waitress to take it away and I had pork instead  the veg was not as nice and lumpy gravy to go on top  thought it was just a one off but have been twice more now and it was the same  what has happenedTtoby  you just lost two loyal customers 
neutral; Fisherman s retreat used to be our weekly joint for food  we used to love the excellent home cooking especially the chips  large portions and cosy atmosphere  for the last few years being a family of foodies we have tried other pubs and restaurants for  and decided to revisit our old favorite  the fisherman s retreat  upon arriving we were initially impressed with the renovations which were very striking  we were seated quite soon in the waiting area which used to be the main restaurant  when taken to our table which was in the new extension that s where the atmosphere ended  we felt like we were at a cooperate day out with a business  not a cosy pub restaurant that it used to be  the  steaks we ordered were overcooked and dry despite asking for rare  and the portions were half the size they used to be  whilst eating the meal we were not asked if everything was OK  at which we would have stated our concerns  at the end of the meal when they came to collect our plates we then had the chance to discreetly say that the steaks were over done  to which she told us she would mention it to the chef manager and that was it  at the time of paying our bill we mentioned again and the waitress shrugged her shoulders and didn t really know what to say or do  overall the service was OK and food were OK  but is overpriced and the atmosphere is almost non existent compared to its former self  disappointed and will not be returning unfortunately  Gutted  
neutral; Service was good  friendly staff  nice decor and the ribs were really nice but the chicken wings were a big let down   quite bland and not spicy whatsoever  Would probably go again but would get more ribs instead of chicken  Overall decent food but a tad overpriced for what it was  
neutral; Me and my partner hadn t planned on dining here we stumbled across it  I found the menu slightly disappointing as all that is available is chicken hot dogs and burgers mainly  but I guess it s that style of place even though I thought the selection could have been larger  the service was good and staff attentive  it s basic inside but with a slightly quirky feel to the place  I ordered a chilli burger around    and my partner ordered a steak baguette again similar price with fries included which I might add were home made and delicious always a winner with my partner  unfortunately they don t sell coffee here which I found quite a shock   not many restaurants don t have coffee facilities  Both meals were huge and surprisingly very well cooked we both enjoyed our meal  the floor I found to be slippery and the toilets nothing more to say apart from DRAB not very nice at all  The price of the food was reasonable for  meals and a side of coleslaw a large red wine and an orange juice in a jam jar    not a fan of kitchen roll dumped on a table to be used as a napkin nor the fact the menu was covered in some one else s lunch  I won t hurry back but I will say good value for food just a shame the rest doesn t meat the standard   
neutral; We went at  on a Tuesday night  it was surprisingly busy  there was no queue at the carvery and the gentleman serving was jovial  I had the no meat option whilst my partner had the beef and turkey  The veg was bland and the hottest thing on my plate was the gravy  My partner enjoyed his but agreed that it could have been warmer We were testing ready to take fussy relatives  Not good enough I m afraid  
neutral; Great decoration  ideal for a date  The food was not extraordinary but the environment made us have a great time  Don t be shy and order one of the Moroccan red wines  
neutral; We hadn t eaten at the York for a while since moving to a different part of Sheffield but decided to go for brunch after receiving an email about    brunch  on getting the bill we were told we weren t allowed the    offer as we didn t book in advance  although this was really not made clear in the email    We both had eggs Benedict as we always love it at the York when it s made with shredded ham hock  however we were so dissapointed to see that it now comes with thin slices of sandwich ham instead and is not nearly as good as it was  Service was also poor with our drinks arriving after our food and the staff are nowhere near as knowledgable and helpful as they used to be  Such a shame as the York was once my favourite restaurant but small errors are making it slip considerably  
neutral; Food was very ordinary we found the food quite bland we left early and had dinner at a small Italian bistro  
neutral;I booked a table for my son and I before heading to the theatre  The restaurant is light and airy but the chairs and tables are hard plywood  not the most comfortable  Also no clothes stand  and as the chairs are short  you end up with your coat trailing on the ground   So  the food  We both had burger and chips  They were nice  but not exceptional and the portion sizes were adequate  The chips were fries  very salty and thin  The burger was well cooked and loaded with fresh salad  A good burger but with chips costing extra  just shy of  quid for burgers and chips seemed extravagant   For pudding  my son had a knickerbocker glory which was well presented and used home made jelly  He was impressed and this was reasonably prices around five pounds  I had a baked Alaska which was mediocre  Very sweet and bland tasting    I also had a coffee which was strong and well made  but the cup was tiny    Service   friendly staff  but a long wait for desert    In summary  for a one off it s fine but it s certainly not exceptional  The menu is very limited and for basic fast food  on the expensive side  I wouldn t go back  The food was no better than chains such as Giraffe  and the price wasn t justified 
neutral; Booked a table here after visiting the website as looked beautiful and we were not wrong  Was busy when we came   only seemed to be one waitress which then lead to a slow and disjointed service  Despite this the waitress was very nice   helpful  There was a distinct lack of vegetarian starters though  Mains were lovely however I was dissapointed with my pudding  I was warned by the waitress what to expect but thought the puddings seemed to  posh  for the rest of the menu  
neutral; Had a chocolate afternoon tea  not enough sandwiches and refused when asked for more  Too many sickly chocolate stuff  would have preferred more sandwiches savouries which were nice and less cakes  we were given only one scone each  We were not too keen having a cocktail included in the price  this could have gone towards more food and tea  We were not checked to see if we wanted more tea  I think alcoholic drinks should have been an extra option as in other venues    The afternoon tea is held in the bar area   big mistake   it was so noisy with rowdy crowds of men sitting at tables near us  we had to shout to hear each other  in the end we just stopped talking  finished our food and could not wait to get out of the place  As the restaurant is empty during this time  surely it would make sense to have the afternoon tea downstairs at more comfortable seating where it is quiet  It felt so unrelaxed  It is also quite dark in the bar area   Whilst the staff were pleasant  we did have a few hiccups: we did not have enough cutlery on the table  we had to ask for clean plates for our scone as chocolate stuff made plates dirty  no clean cutlery replaced for further use and for the triffle like pudding in the glasses  had to wait  minutes for a clean plate after asking for it  in the end used our napkins  had to wait ages for the tea and wrong tea was given to one of us  and would have liked to have it with our food rather than the cocktail first  even though I requested this   Then when asked for the bill  we noticed we were charged an extra    after one of us had paid by credit card for their share of the bill  The waitress had to go and check this out with the manager and took about  minutes  This could have been sorted at the table there and then by adjusting what the rest of us were paying with cash  then one of us were not given enough change back  which led to more delays  Definitely not coming back to this place    
neutral; Food is very poor quality given the price and they seem to have a high staff turnover  Brilliant service though and a comfortable interior  
neutral; The cocktails were disappointing  The food was ok but nothing to write home about  The food miraculously appeared within a couple of minutes of placing the order and we were asked to vacate our table as soon as we d finished  Won t be making a return visit  
neutral;I stopped off at Rita s on a Sunday morning after a walk along the prom as it was raining heavily as I was passing so decided to shelter  I have to say that I had to fight my way through the smog of cooking before getting to the counter  Two young lads in front of me ordered full English breakfasts and I ordered a milky coffee  There were only seconds between their order being taken and my own order and yet I was dismayed that their breakfasts were cooked and served to them in the same time it took for my coffee  The smell of the cooking was a little off putting along with the smoke from it so I didn t order food  The cafÇ¸ is exceptionally basic and I didn t feel there was any real atmosphere to the place  I cannot comment on the food as I didn t have any  and the coffee I had was OK  but it seems a very popular cafÇ¸ to be honest so would guess the food is OK  From the prices I saw  they are reasonable but it really isn t my kind of cafÇ¸  The staff were pleasant enough and it was clean but not for me I m afraid 
neutral;We came here because every other restaurant had a queue on the hottest Saturday in London  The staff were very nice and welcoming  the decor was sweet but not over the top  We ordered  Tapas in total  but there were a couple of orders wrong  I will recommend the Beef Croquettes  the kind prawns too if you like spicy  Everything else was very   oily    It took ages to pay because they only had  card machine  Otherwise  service was ok 
neutral; Visited Cleaver for the st time over the weekend  The menu is very sparse   no starters and small selection of main courses  So your expectation is that the food will be excellent   it should easy for the kitchen to manage the small menu  The food was reasonable  but no better than a decent pub   the only difference is the price  Main courses don t come with anything   so if you want salad chips potatoes etc you have to pay an additional    per side  My husband had a burger   it was   just for that  With chips and onion rings on the side  it ended up being very expensive for a burger that was no better than standard pub fare  Good atmosphere  Reasonable food  Hugely over priced  
neutral; We called here hoping to get a meal place was packed solid only small table by door available  we just stayed for a drink  then went elsewhere staff very friendly though will go back again when we go back to isle of wight 
neutral;Hobbs Boat is a very nice place  food is good and the people are friendly  yes i would go there again 
neutral;I visited this restaurant with clients and had quite high expectations having read the website and I was a bit disappointed  The building is located on Bournemouth sea front near the Aquarium   We had booked a table and were seated by the window which was nice as it was a very hot day and the breeze was welcome  There is outside seating overlooking the beach and sea  although the beach was absolutely packed   The restaurant was also packed out for a Monday lunchtime and the staff seemed to be tearing around trying to serve everyone   We were welcomed by a very pleasant waiter who took our drink order and brought us menus  There was also a specials board  However they had run out of a lot of things including  turbot  oysters and gnocchi   As we were time limited we decided on some appetisers rather than starters and ordered pitta bread with houmus  taramasalata  anchovies  oil and balsamic and some artisan bread  This came reasonably quickly and was quite nice   For mains we ordered fish pie with vegetables  half a lobster and chips  lemon sole with veg and lemon sole with salad   We waited a fair time for the main courses and I was disappointed that the vegetables were swimming in butter  the carrots were al dente but verging on hard and the green beans were limp and horrible  I also felt the fish was over cooked and was quite hard on top whereas underneath it was better  I would have expected it to be cooked perfectly for We decided to skip pudding and just go for coffee and almost had to leave before it arrived as we were being picked up  As we were leaving a child started screaming and I thought it was the fire alarm it was so loud   I also didn t like the fact that people were wandering in off the beach in their swimming costumes and really thought the place would have not allowed it as it is portrayed as quite a high class restaurant   Total cost for  people including  bottles of water and a small carafe of wine was   which was relatively expensive for what we had   I wouldn t rush back based on this experience
neutral; Called in last night and admit it is a lovely place  very cosy  However the food left a lot to be desired  We both had the small portion of haddock  chips and peas  which was a good size to be fair  But everything was completely tasteless  chips  fish and peas  I cannot believe everything is fresh as we only waited about ten minutes from ordering to being served  I wish i d simply gone to my local chippy  it would have been far cheaper and couldn t have been any worse than the food we had  Sorry  
neutral; After being unable to get a carvery elsewhere we opted to come here for some dinner  The food was ok  but after having to wait  minutes for food we d gone past hungry and we didn t really enjoy our meals  Its not the first time we ve been here and had to wait this long for food  which is why we haven t been back in a while   Hopefully things have improved and we won t need to wait so long on our next visit x 
neutral; I m not a fan of fried food but I do like the very occasional glass of mead so its worth a visit for this alone  Also I went with my  children who love the place  fried food included  They loved the atmosphere and the costumes worn by the servers  Can imagine it gets busy at certain times with the heavy mead drinkers  
neutral;This is a new addition to the culinary scene in Swindon  I have never visited a Carluccio s before so didn t really know what to expect  We went for an early dinner sitting at  pm  the staff were very friendly and their service throughout was excellent   As this is a new restaurant it is light and airy  basically its a nice place to be  However  the main event with any restaurant is the food  This is where Carluccios started to fall down   I had the typical starter of Bruschetta  for    I felt like I had been cheated  It was alright but nothing special  The real let down was the mains  I had the Spaghetti polpette  meatballs   The spaghetti was overcooked and bland  the polpette looked as insipid as it comes  The whole thing lacked flavour  The overriding flavour was garlic  This is the level of Italian cuisine you could get a Pizza Express or Prezzos at a cheaper price   The only saving grace to this meal was the ciccolatta Fiorentina and Tiramisu for dessert  Both were rich and tasty   Will not be returning to Carluccios in a hurry  Within Swindon the local Italian restaurants have much more to offer in terms of flavour and cost go to Fabio s or Gaetano s 
neutral; Visited midweek and the restaurant was half full but had a lovely atmosphere  Service was very good  but unfortunately the food did not live up to expectations  My friend had fillet steak which she said was very nice  but so small she had finished it before I was half way through my main course of duck  I requested it pink  which is how it came  but it was so tough that it was almost inedible and was covered in what seemed like a jar of heated up  course cut marmalade   very bitter  and did not compliment the shredded greens or the duck  We didn t bother with dessert  For bread  two mains   small glasses of wine and a bottle of water  the bill came to Pricey and I felt the quality of the food let this restaurant down  
neutral; I took my husband here for a cream tea  The scones were nice but the atmosphere was not  I expected china plates and cups  not cheap stuff that would look at home in a greasy spoon cafe  Tablecloths would have been nice  I would not go again  
neutral; Visited on  September  and am sorry to say myself and my partner were disappointed  It used to be so much better before the refurb  Reminded me of a school dinner hall  My partner s baked mushroom starter was bland and small  I had a  new  starter which was pleasant but not really restaurant standard  My main of chicken and tagliatelle with creamy mushroom sauce was watery and lacking in any real flavour  My partner had the lasagne which he did enjoy but thought it was on the small side  And our initial waitress was brusque  abrupt and unfriendly  The second waitress was warm  friendly and polite  
neutral;We took our god daughters for lunch yesterday and had booked a table  The decor is lovely  the staff smart and the menu caused tough decisions   in a good way   minutes to take a drinks order  Another  for the water to come and our food order to be taken  An hour and a quarter for the food to arrive   The food was sublime for all of us  A real delight   When we had finished our food  out of  plates were removed and mine left for a further seeming age  It took so long for the desert menu to arrive we abandoned any idea of pudding or coffee  by this stage we had had one course in  hours   It then took  seconds for the bill to arrive and a a few seconds to retrieve my card but  minutes to come back with the card machine  By this stage it was approaching  o clock and the restaurant was almost empty before the tea crowd   Really disappointing when the food is so good  the venue superb and brilliantly situated to meet up  I m in two minds what to do again 
neutral;My bill totalled    and a gratuity of    was added to the bill which I did not spot until I had pressed the  quot Enter quot  button on the card machine  Be wary of this when paying your bill  I don t mind leaving a tip but this is extortionate 
neutral; Visited this pub restaurant in its infancy  Building lovely  staff friendly and service good  The menu was fairly limited and much too expensive for what it was  The wine was also very expensive  There was nothing surprising or different on offer and bearing in mind there are a few other good restaurants in the surrounding area there was nothing to make me recommend this to friends or family  Also paying for separate vegetables is not really pub style food  It needs to move up to restaurant or cheapen down to pub grub  
neutral; This was my second visit with friends  The decor has been upgraded and looks nice although the chairs remain old and mismatched  The service was friendly and good but the food wasn t great  The veg wasn t cooked through and the chips were hard  Also a bit overpriced for pub food for fish   chips   the mixed grill was over    Would we go again  Probably not 
neutral; Went here yesterday as a group of  for a birthday  I found the seating extremely uncomfortable in there  a few of the other people also commented on this as well  Me   my partner got a starter for  which was priced at  which was ridiculous as there was practically nothing on the plate  A few olives  a meat ball each  a bit of salad   tiny meat things and cheese sauce   do not get the sharer platters absolute waste of money  BUT it did get better with the main  we ordered duck fajitas which were delicious  we had  pancakes each which was just about enough  I still think nearly  pounds is still quite pricey for what it is but the duck was lovely  You can refill your wheel with salsa  cheese etc  for free which was good because a table of  quickly ran out  My friends told me the Burritos were really nice  Drinks were fairly priced  Staff were ok  Nice mexican but over priced  
neutral;Costa coffee always take ages that s a given as it s fresh coffee  but the Congleton branch take it to a new all time slow   Staff are to busy chatting to each other to serve customers   plates stacked high on tables and a general do I actually have to work attitude    Shame as other cost as up and down country actually value customers 
neutral; We had dinner there at the weekend and the food was brilliant  a nice selection on the menu and was very good and worth the money  The Whalebone has a very nice atmosphere  What was disappointing was the waiting staff  they were not very good at all  it was being run by  younger staff  that had lack of customer service and motivation  and it was very much the customer approach the waiting staff  The Whalebone has always had a very good name for itself  being a pricier boutique pub restaurant  but i feel it has gone down hill a bit  
neutral; Starter was OK  dessert was nice  main course was very disappointing  What was billed as leg of lamb arrived as one slice of lamb with some dry roasties  one piece of broccoli and one piece of cauliflower  Overpriced for what it was   there are other pubs in the area offering better food for the same price  The staff were friendly and nice  
neutral;Great food  as always at Jamie s  But didn t like the downstairs at all  dark  noisy  we could barely hear one another  Service was poor  the table next to us got all the attention  we were ignored 
neutral; They ve obviously done a LOT of work on this place: the car park is now very smart  and nicely signposted  the garden looks very inviting  the dining room was sadly empty  We had reserved a table  and the rather diffident and quietly spoken  but perfectly polite  young man pointed it out to us immediately we mentioned that we were the advance party of  of the eventual   He offered us menus so that we could begin to browse  which was a nice touch  The menu hadn t changed much from the  quot Spring Menu quot  on the website  which made choosing a little easier    I had a nice choice of veggie options  going for the Leek  Stilton and Hazelnut Crumble  which was very tasty   Oddly  though  it contained peas  and was served with peas   would ve liked a different vegetable for one or the other component   The  quot herb and vanilla pannacotta arctic roll quot  was interesting   we couldn t actually place the herb  we thought it might have been rosemary  but the taste was SO diluted it was hard to be sure  in the pannacotta  and the arctic roll sponge outer had a very odd  dense and chewy texture  The filling was nice  though   a sorbet which was nicely chilled and sweet   Couldn t tell you what flavour it was  but the temperature and texture were nice enough for it not to be a huge problem  My dining companions were very pleased with the seafood risotto  although those that had the lamb said it was a little overseasoned salty  The toffee apple crumble disappeared VERY quickly  The tea afterwards came in proper teapots  and the coffee was in generous sized cups  For six of us  with some having starters and some having desserts  the total was under    which is not bad    Shame that there were so few people in the dining room  it made it a bit echo y and atmosphere free  but it WAS a Wednesday  and there was plenty of evidence of a bit more life to be had at the weekends  with live music and exhortations to book for Sunday lunch etc  They need to look at why when the cd stuck annoyingly for several minutes   white noise loud enough to drown our conversation  nobody behind the bar could hear it  Other than that  it was a perfectly ok evening  Perhaps we should try the Sunday lunches  next  
neutral;Nice place for a pub meal  Very helpful and accommodating staff  Food was very nice pub fayre  If you wish for a more special eating place try the Cove Inn at Lulworth or Weld Arms  East Lulworth  Very good but best to book especially for the Cove Inn 
neutral;Looked forward to eating here as I knew the beer good  Oh dear  We ordered  starter as I wasn t that hungry they brought out the starter and main together  apologized and took main back  Mains arrived my order was incorrect  By this point I gave up as didn t want to cause a fuss  I am sorry but the veg was an embarrassment in size I had  carrot slices plus around one forkfull of cabbage  Pie was excellent and gravy   Please do consider this as constructive criticism as I eat at Chester regularly and wouldn t like such a good pub which is starting out in such a difficult and competitive area loose out  I know you class yourselves as a gastro pub but maybe consider the everyday clientele  
neutral; I m a real fan of fine dining and trying out new places  but for me the Ledbury totally lacks in atmosphere  It s a real treat to go to somewhere like this  so to have a mostly disinterested staff  badly laid out tables so you re too close to others and food that isn t particularly wow factor was disappointing considering its reputation  The one excellent thing was the sommelier  who had a great personality and was so interactive with us   very much saved the whole experience  It s clearly the place people feel they re  quot meant quot  to go  as there were lots of people who didn t seem at all bothered to be somewhere that up market   lots of business   client meetings going on  The food was good  but I definitely wouldn t go back  
neutral; Nice  big and spacious  the food is typical pub grub  handy for a quick  cheap meal  Service is ok  lots of menu choices  didnt have to wait long for our food  would go again  
neutral; As a family meal for   we visited here as my nanny highly recommends it   If you get claustrophobic this isn t the pub for you  lots of niknaks  trinkets and tables very close together  Lots of chalkboards everywhere and low ceilings  But very quaint and country styled pub  Seated immediately and given menus which are more like a small novel rather than a choice of food   Ordered at the bar and food arrived within minutes  Very large portions  good quality food and very filling  Seafood lasagne was amazing and homemade pie was very tasty  Could of done with a better sauce selection to match the extensive menu  Dessert of treacle sponge was the best I ve tasted  Overall good food but in a bit cramped interior  also could do with an outdoor sign from Norwich to crostwick to alert drivers the white horse is coming up soon so makes it easier to see round the corner  
neutral; We booked a table here for a family meal having been taken by a friend before  The first time we visited we ordered at the bar   the food was delicious  This time when I phoned to book a table for  plus space for a highchair at   I was asked if I could make the booking for    sure no problem I thought  When we arrived we had to wait a bit to get a table still no worries it was fathers day  however the table we were taken to was for  with a chair put at the end  no space for a highchair we complained telling them that we were asked to move our booking so we expected a suitable table they eventually moved us  The food took a while to arrive but it was nice  until my husbands desert arrived caramel apple pie it was cold in the middle so asked for another one that took some time to arrive so he ate his desert after ours  Then when we got our bill we were charged for  apple pies no the  we had in the end they took  pies off the bill after we pointed this out   also the problem with the cold pie  I would try the Grange again however either reinstate people ordering at the bar or get more staff in  
neutral; Ok so we have not been here for a couple of years but when we did go it was regular and we loved the food and atmosphere    Today I was disappointed  The staff were very helpful  Drinks were fine    When it came to the food  My husband had steak and ale pie with fries which he said was very nice    I ordered the sirloin with fries and calamari  When it arrived they had forgot my calamari I mentioned this and it was rectified instantly  Next the chips were very nice  The steak was cooked raw to medium but it was cold  the mushrooms were cold  The calamari very hot    Very disappointed and not sure will return shortly  I would say you should try it at least once  
neutral; Stayed at this hotel for one night whilst on business  Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful but some aspects of the hotel were disappointing  There was no hairdryer in my room which I find unusual these days  Breakfast was just average although it was great to have fresh fruit  I used the pool in the spa  It was lovely and warm but the area had a  tired  feel to it  
neutral; Family Sunday lunch   a little confusing as to the way it works  not having been before  Queue to get drinks at the bar and to order pay for carvery  People milling around a lot  watch out for waiting staff flying around and the kitchen door opening right into the walkways  Could do with a better system for the carvery as several people managed to get served without paying first  as they hadn t realised they were supposed to   staff didn t check receipts before serving  Food was fine  plenty of veg gravy etc   no worse or better than many carveries  Large building  took ages to find the members of our party who had arrived first and been seated  as there was a whole area I hadn t realised was there   don t be afraid to explore if you re looking for someone  
neutral; Popped here as staying at the Premier Inn  Went in at pm shown straight to a table  Was very quiet  Lady took out meal choices she was lovely and friendly  The salad bar was a big let down hardly anything left and looked like no intention to fill again  When our starter arrived we ordered chorizo and garlic bread  There is no way they were chorizo  When the main came out the coleslaw looked a bit iffy  Meal was alright nothing to shout out but it s harvester so we never expect amazing food  The place all in was ok don t look at the lights though full of cobwebs  Don t think they ever been cleaned  Good job had a voucher giving us % off because would have been even more disappointed  
neutral; This is a classic case of something not living up to the hype  Perhaps I d be writing a better review of Carlo s had I not read the Trip Advisor reviews beforehand  Anyway  last night was date night and my boyfriend and I went out for dinner to Carlo s Trattoria  As I ve mentioned in other reviews  I m on the hunt for Surrey s best Italian experience and I was really excited to try Carlo s Trattoria  especially based on all the rave reviews I d read on here  All I can say is  I wish I knew what those reviewers ate SERVICE Let s start with the positives  I thought the service was good  The waiters were polite  attentive and informative  I ve been learning basic Italian and I even had a chance to practice a little with our very patient waiter  No complaints here   ATMOSPHERE Carlo s is not what you d expect from a traditional Italian trattoria  It s not cosy  I wouldn t say it s romantic  Inside it s very white and sterile with strange dated decor on the walls  I ll be fair and stress that this is very much personal preference  Carlo obviously has a particular style and who am I to say he should do otherwise  It just wasn t to my taste  There were actually some lovely photos of good times in the family restaurant on the wall as we entered  I d have loved to see more of that in the restaurant   FOOD Now he s where I felt disappointed  Not upset or disgusted  just disappointed  I judge a great Italian restaurant by the quality of it s produce  Eating in Italy is an experience you never forget because produce grown in Italy simply tastes different  The tomatoes explode with flavour  the prosciutto is moist with an intense salty  flavour  From what I d read about Carlo s I expected flavours from Italy  but that s not what we got   I had the prosciutto e melone for starter  I was disappointed with the prosciutto  It was dry and the flavour was    lacking  I actually wondered off hand if they d simply peeled it from a pack bought in Sainsbury s  We ordered the bruschetta  usually my boyfriend s favourite part of any Italian meal  The bread was burnt on the bottom  The melted mozzarella on top reminded me of cheese on toast  And once again I wondered if the tomatoes  bland and watery  had been bought from Sainsbury s  Where was the explosion of flavour  On the plus side  my boyfriend quite enjoyed the chicken liver pate   For main  I had the Tagliolini Tartufati  This was lovely and creamy but not overwhelming  I loved the subtle hit of white truffle  Boyfriend had the Penna Lucanica and couldn t finish it  I had a bite of the sausage and found it grainy and chewy  Not pleasant eating   It was just our first time  but sadly I don t think we ll go back  But if you re looking for a restaurant that does decent Italian food with British ingredients  it s okay  We paid a lot and walked away underwhelmed  
neutral; Went with some friends for a Saturday lunch as we couldn t get into Tom Browns at Gunthorpe  Had been here before and had a nice Sunday lunch so thought it would make a good alternative being owned by the same company  The staff were polite and attentive  however  when the starters arrived one was missing  we all sat for a good five minutes letting ours go cold while we waited  We asked a waitress to see what had happened to it and she shortly arrived with the missing starter  Apparently  there had been an accident in the kitchen but no one had thought to tell us  The waitress was extremely apologetic  The starters were all good  although  were a little cold from waiting   We didn t do quite so well with the main dishes though  I had a poached salmon dish with beetroot  The dish lacked taste and the salmon was dry and bland  I did not enjoy it at all  My partner had the pork which he also said was dry and bland  The cheeseboard was a little boring too and the Pinot Grigio we had wasn t even very nice  And I must say I have never had a bottle of Pinot anywhere that hasn t been nice before  Maybe we just got them on a bad day but   for  people for lunch isn t cheap and we expected a much higher standard  Having said all that  the company was good  but then you choose your friends  
neutral; Visited on Sat th April  arriving at  am  Had a long wait for our order to be taken  Ordered pot of tea and a mint tea  and had another wait before this arrived  Staff friendly but appeared disorganised  Nice decor  
neutral;Visited for a pre Christmas get together with neibours   Lovely atmosphere staff very professional and efficient our starters were the scallops very tasty but a little on the sparse side for the money one person got Main course very well seasoned and presented   And then we all ordered cheese what we got was slithers of cheese and at    a portion seemed someone was being rather to economical and to present a table of  with the huge slate stands piled up seemed a bit like a circus trick   We love the place and hope one day the chief may comes out for a few comments in a nice way please give us value for money on the night we eat vouchers are not going to bring you back if the portions stay so small
neutral; We went to La Tasca for my husband s birthday  It was a very busy night and it seemed that kitchen couldn t keep up with orders so we waited long time to be seated and even longer for our food to arrive  Once the food did arrive it was good  especially the prawns and calamari  The really positive thing was service by Kamil  our waiter who was very attentive and helpful  
neutral; took a very long time to cook and it came in stages so we all ate at different times  didn t like the bun with my burger  those horrible flour buns  but it was ok they over cooked my onion rings as well would use again if I couldn t find anywhere else to eat 
neutral; I ve visited here a couple of times over June and July and have had a pleasant time at both outings  The first was for dinner  where the pizzas were all right if nothing special  and the second for a full breakfast which was again all right if nothing special  though the coffee was really  really good   Both times I found the prices to be reasonable for the amount and quality of the food  What s particularly lovely about this place  though  are the friendly staff  the excellent location  and its suitability for all sorts of groups  be it couples on a casual date  solo diners  groups  or families  Do sit outside if the weather permits  I ll be back  not especially for the food but because of the excellent feel and atmosphere of the place  
neutral; last night we decided to go out for tea  i decided to have the fish plater which wasnt on the  for one When it came i had  very small fish cakes and  very small pieces of battered fish lots of lettice with a few prawns on it  pototoe wedges and a spoonful of mushy peas it sounds a lot but wasnt  my hushband had steak with  drinks it was   very disappointing 
neutral; We don t eat beef but were persuaded by rave reviews from vegetarian family and carnivore friends to ignore the name and try this place  Sunday lunch  at    is steep compared to our favoured  Michelin starred  restaurants and the food is not in the same league but it was fine  What made it for us was the staff  They are great and we left with huge smiles and a spring in our step   The clientele seemed to be majoring in the roast rib of beef and good for them but sadly for us it is too  quot family quot  with lots of babies and kids around to make us want to come back  At just under   for non meat lunch for two  I don t want to have to compete with crying and adults indulging kiddies to be heard   So  if you ve got the dosh to spare  love beef and kids then you ll love this place  
neutral; After spending a nice day in Lymington  decided to eat at the ship  I ordered smoked haddock fishcakes  which was very disappointed at the size of the portion which was more like a starter than a main  Looked like two small meat balls with an egg  I don t eat much but this was just ridiculous  
neutral;visited today and yes the place is lovely a nice farm shop and cafe and i thought the play area was lovely   however the food prices put me off  for a ham salad   its not london and it hasnt got a Michelin star  the coffee was nice but my daughter decided to get some wedges as she was so hungry and they were   something for  fat wedges   they were lovely granted   but its one large potato its such a shame as i think the price is a little greedy and will limit the place  to the middle and upper classes or middle to high earners that can afford those prices   il stick with the coffee   
neutral; The restaurant as a canteen feel about it  which didn t matter before but I feel the quality of food as gone down  Most of what I ate tasted Quite bland  staff have never been over friendly  Maybe I am more into quality rather than quantity  Won t be rushing back  
neutral; Really great customer service but I just found the food a bit expensive for what it was  Don t come here if you want large portions for your money  
neutral; Had a carvery which was priced well  Due to late afternoon not all food was still warm and limited variety compared to other places which are priced cheaper  Meat was good though and my daughter ate a lot for her  Kids get a free ice cream too albeit only one scoop   atmosphere was good and the enclosed play area is brilliant for children  Would definitely come again for that aspect alone having two children  Definitely good for a few hours in an afternoon  
neutral; We had to urgently request the dessert we had ordered be served   they were so busy we had to wait sometime  They reacted swiftly when they realised we had to complete our meal  and attempt to return to our lodgings before it was completely dark  we didn t quite manage it   Parking was a nightmare  
neutral; This is lovely old pub  great atmosphere  warm and cosy  and friendly staff  but the Sunday carvery is misnamed   the meat is pre sliced  very thinly  and put on plates with gravy which is then put on the carvery counter covered in tin foil  Our meat was so thinly sliced and covered in gravy that you were not sure what meat you were actually eating  The veggies  Yorkshires  gravy and sauces are all fresh  local and beautifully cooked but the whole experience is let down by the meat  This is such a shame because two or three properly cooked joints  carved at the carvery counter would make it really great   come on MT Inn upgrade your meat to a proper carvery and it would be so good  
neutral; Came here for a team meal  Restaurant suggested set menu  then when it came to ordering  one of the puddings was sold out  Very slow service  and waitress opened new wine bottles and refilled without asking  Colleagues told me their mains were lovely  my vegetarian main was average  dumpling nice  but not enough  too much sweet potato  and slightly burned  and the scorched lettuce was just yucky  Panna cotta was nice  But over  hrs to serve  courses   not so great  
neutral; I m new to Worcester and have been using trip advisor to try new eating establishment   I tried another Italian last week and thoroughly enjoyed it  Unfortunately I didn t enjoy this place as much  Its not that it was bad  it just wasn t great   I had a pasta dish that wasn t great although my friend said her pizza was good  Service was good nothing bad there   I m not saying I wouldn t return because I may do one day maybe just for lunch     
neutral; My mum loves this place  so do take my review with a pinch of salt  But every time I eat here  I go away thinking that I could have made the meal myself  Lunch this week was no exception   after waiting for  minutes for a table  we sat down and ordered  The menu is relatively sparse   no bad thing in itself   and the vegetarian option was a chickpea and cauliflower curry with rice and an onion bhaji  My friend had a lettuce salad with cucumber and lentils   huge plate  lots of lettuce  did not come with anything else and we were charged extra for the bread she wanted    all in all  I found the food a bit dull and once again left thinking that it was basically ok not wonderful home cooking  The bhaji was rather sorry looking and the chickpea curry was kind of reminiscent of the canteen at work  Sorry  I guess there is a place for it  and it wasn t an extortionately expensive meal for the four of us  for a drink and main course and pudding   Pudding was the really exceptional course  so credit where credit is due  The praline and caramel parfait was to die for  and the warm brownie and ice cream seemed to disappear really quickly too  all with lots of smiles   The service was great and our lovely Iranian waitress was friendly and helpful   I would probably come back and just have pudding and a coffee    
neutral; Have now been twice to this restaurant  It is a good location to meet friends after work for dinner  Love the location and the restaurant is beautiful and effortless   Service is attentive and friendly  Food is good but I ve never had a  WOW  moment here  For the prices here I ve surely had better food in London although it has always met expectations  Barbecoa just next door is a different restaurant  but if you are after red meat you are better off heading there for impressive food and a wonderful view of the cathedral  Having said this I will be back again as the restaurant has its own draw of good ambience  decent cocktails  fab location and fish on its menu  
neutral; We visited the pub last Sunday   I hadn t been there since it first opened many years ago  A nice friendly welcome with a good log fire made for a  lovely warm atmosphere  We chose the Sunday roast which was excellent with a generous portion of roast beef which was very tender  the vegetables were cooked just about right   not too soft and not too hard  We chose Baked Plum Pudding for afters and I expected plums topped with sponge but when it came  Yes  it was a light and delicious sponge but with what looked like thin downed jam over the top  not really like I envisaged Baked Plum Pudding  it would have been nice to see some actual Plums  Perhaps it would have been better to describe it as Baked Plum Jam Pudding   Apart from this we received warm and friendly service and based on this visit  worth a recommendation  
neutral; Clean and tidy pub   slightly expensive but this is Padstow after all  Possibly too many televisions which detract for the surroundings  
neutral; Drive Thru on the Gosport Fareham Road  KFC to me  but some people have commented that they prefer than the one in Gosport 
neutral; We tried eating here again after the last disappointing visit   decided to give it a go in case they had had a bad day previously  Unfortunately  It hasn t improved   We were left standing waiting for a table for twenty minutes  in spite of having booked  Several Barstaff walking about telling us someone would be with us in a minute  But there only appeared to be two waiting Staff in the whole restaurant  It was too late to go to another restaurant  so we decided to wait   along with a queue of others behind us   Upon being seated  our drinks order took  minutes to arrive  Starters were Ok  but they did not have any potato options available for the main course  with the exception of chips  So I changed my original order  Mains were OK   we both had the flat iron steak salad  It was edible  but not the greatest    We asked for the bill and were surprised to see they and included an extra main course  overcharging us by    It was rectified quickly  I love eating out normally  but didn t enjoy the experience here  We had a voucher to use  so it wasn t too expensive a meal  but would have been vastly overpriced if we had paid the full bill   Won t be visiting again anytime soon  Such a shame  as the setting is lovely and the menu looks great  
neutral;I have wanted to try this place since it opened  on arrival we went up to the restaurant   great ambience and fairly informal atmosphere  When greeted  I gave the host my reservation details to which he then just pointed at my table and walked off  That started things off badly for me  you should always show a customer to the table in a restaurant in my opinion  If it was in the pub  I wouldn t be too bothered but other diners were shown to their table  I m not sure why we weren t  The second waiter was great and very attentive throughout our meal except the wine wasn t poured to check if it hadn t corked  we had to do that ourselves    Starters were the best part of the whole meal  I had scallops and they were great and wonderfully presented  The mains were pretty large portions but somewhat disappointing compared to the standard of the starter  What bothered me the most was the inconsistency in the quality of the service  the rude waiter who hosted at the beginning of our time in the restaurant hadn t approached our table throughout the meal  when we left a tip  he was there in a flash before we had even left the restaurant which was extremely disappointing to see considering it wasn t there for him    Overall  the meal was nice   I m not sure I would go again because the service isn t consistent throughout all staff members which is a shame considering the food was good and the beer selection is great  It was a quiet Friday night and service from all  except Lloyd our waiter  was pretty poor and definitely needs improving to keep people coming back 
neutral; been here many times mostly with friends and most of the time its ok but when i went last night i was really dissapointed in the food and it was really pricey for what i got  the staff were miserable   its a bit sad because i usually like it and its put me off   
neutral; I had expected a little more from this cafe  We had planned on heading here for breakfast as we d been told it opened at :  Turned out this was more like   when we went back in for breakfast   The baileys milkshake isn t a thick shake with ice and ice cream mixed in   It s milk and baileys with ice cream on top A little disappointing   The burger and salad we had were more hearty and tasty than anticipated though  
neutral;We had a table booked for  people on a Wednesday night  WE went for the live music which was rather nice to have whilst sitting in the picnic lounge  However although the staff were very nice to us the service was a joke  It was extremely slow considering its a small place with not many table  Each time we ordered drinks it would be  minuets before receiving it and had to wait  hour and  minuets for food to come  but even then it came out so staggered we didn t get to eat all together really  The atmosphere was nice and food very average I don t think I wouldn t recommend this place as I wont be rushing to go back myself 
neutral; I cannot really understand the reviews that only gave this place one or two stars  I admit is it not a gourmet place and is pretty average but I guess the prices also reflect this  I cannot say I am taken by the decor  very bright and plasticy  However I have found the staff friendly and although the decor is not to my tastes it is clean and warm in there  I have only ever had a soup and a sandwich at Fourboyz  although it is not the best food I have every had  the soup was tasty and homemade  the sandwich was just on ordinary bread but had plenty of filling in    for soup and a sandwich in York is pretty good value though  I got a coffee which came with a tiny cone with ice cream in which I thought was a nice touch and something a bit different  
neutral; Visited for brunch for my birthday  I have quite a lot of restrictions in terms of what I can and can t eat  I figured a place like this   raw  vegan  etc   would cater for individuals that may need that extra attention to detail specific requests   I asked what fruit the crepe contained  On the first occasion the waitress came back and told me what the Fruit salad contained  So I relayed my question  She went to the bar and didn t return  Then my Husband had to get up go to the counter and ask her again    We ordered our smoothies  At    each  I was disappointed to have them served with ice  Why on earth would you serve a smoothie with ice   In February  when it is COLD  We aren t in Australia  And I don t want ice taking up space and ruining my   smoothie  Pathetic  I couldn t be bothered asking for another  where I normally would  as the waitress seemed incapable of basic service   The food was good   but the service ruined the experience  None of the staff smile  seem really stiff stressed and miserable  Tanya needs to get them to read her motivational boards she is such a fan of   The atmosphere is odd  Strained   bit boring  Needs something to make it a bit more lovely pleasant  
neutral; Am never fully satisfied when i choose to go here and always ask myself why i choose to keep going back  Answer is i guess the food is good  Sometimes its better than good but the cleanliness is poor  or the food is average and theyve actually emptied the bins and cleaned the tables  Always hit and miss 
neutral; Nice pub  lots of choice on drinks but very disappointed with the Duck main  nothing like the menu description  the roulade dessert ended up being a thick buttercream swissroll which made my teeth itch  Staff were lovely and friendly  
neutral;Disappointing  I had made reservation well in advance  Requested not under stairs and would like a window seat  On arrival  directed to table under stairs   However  we were quickly found elsewhere to sit  Not by a window  Complementary champagne received  Menu lacking excitement  presentation could have been better  Dessert menu also very boring   We had not been to this restaurant for a while has our last experience had not been good   Unfortunately last evening even with the kindness shown by the manager I am afraid the the menu really let them down 
neutral; I visit here every now and then not because I like the coffee but because it is at least consistent  I have visited many independents that seem to offer a better quality product but I find they are sometimes inconsistent  At least here if I order a latte I will get a latte despite the coffee not being exactly to my taste 
neutral; Come here fairly frequently so recommended it to my relatives who were visiting  Sadley disappointed this time   Our waitress was lovely and the drinks arrived promptly  but the meals took over thirty minutes to arrive  and the place wasn t busy   By this time we were pretty hungry  My husband s Shepherd s Pie was sloppy and was mostly mashed potato  My Thai green curry  which I d had before  was this time tastless  with hard  dry chunks of chicken on skewers  My poor mum couldn t even eat her gammon as it was so tough   To be fair  the waitress offered to replace the meal but we declined this as it meant mum would be eating after the rest of us had finished  She filled up with the sticky toffee pudding dessert which was of a good size and nice and hot  Maybe we should have been offered this as compensation for the poor quality mains  Will return here again in the future as we like the ambience of the Springwood  but not for a few months  when hopefully they ve sorted the kitchen problems out  
neutral; The service was good  My husband and I both had the steak in pepper corn sauce  My husband paid slightly more for the larger portion  When they came they both looked the same size  Asked the waitress but she couldn t tell which was the bigger  Said it went by weight  My advise for the future would be don t pay the extra  However  the meal was cooked beautifully  One small point  we were there at   There is a sign asking that under s leave by   We saw at least  families with children  At  the waitress approached one family to point out they should be left  Surely it would have been better to approach these people sooner so they had time to drink up and leave  
neutral;It was a busy Saturday night when we went to this restaurant The service was slow with staff taking their time taaking drink and food orders and then clearing out plates from our tables although it felt like there was a lot of staff running around  Food tastes great although afterwards  out of  of the people I attended with had upset stomachs 
neutral;Pleasant surroundings and pretty waitresses in mop caps  Delicious home made cakes  but the coffee was dreadful  tasted like the cheapest instant all in one from a press button machine  very expencive for what it was  Won t return there are plenty of other places  Sorry I don t like giving bad reviews  but the coffee realy was awful 
neutral; went with friends  It is a lovely pub in a really nice area and the atmosphere at lunchtimes is lovely  Early evening you are really welcome but they do like to close early   On a previous occasion on a friday night they put the lights on high at pm and started cleaning up around us   completely destroying the atmosphere  The carvery s are good value and you can t go wrong with them on a Sunday Lunchtime but on a friday evening  my friends burger was raw in the middle  When he complained we were told that the chef cooks them like that   this is a burger not a steak  They did however happily take it back and cook it further  
neutral; Myself and four others attended here one Saturday evening  We had some drinks first and took these to the sofas round the side  I m not sure if many people know about these so there is a heads up  The drinks were pricey  over   for  drinks  We were shown to our table before our booking at pm which was great as it would have been very late for eating  The starters were tasty and we all ordered the fillet  It was cooked to medium but I found it quite chewy which was a disappointment considering it s supposed to be a premium steak house  The chips were also greasy  There were Santa hats on every table which gave a nice Christmas touch to the meal  There was a live musician singing and playing the piano which added to the atmosphere although at times it was quite loud and difficult to hear each other at the table  The waiters were friendly and the service was quick  The setting itself is fabulous  There are lovely views over Birmingham especially with the night time lights  There is also a balcony outside but it may be worth providing heaters and even blankets so people can enjoy the view from outside  
neutral; Me and my family came here for my cousins st birthday  and although it wasn t awful it just wasn t great either  The prices of food were acceptable however the drinks were outrageous  The service was good  all the staff were very friendly and helpful  and they accommodated to us very well  The food  again not awful  but just not what you would expect to find from this branch of restaurants  The view was definitely the highlight of the experience  the location was amazing  just a shame the prices and the food altered out experience  
neutral; We popped in here to get out of the rain and were made very welcome  We both ordered jerk chicken at the counter and my partner wanted to give a tip but the waitress said  Thats a bit premature  You haven t tasted the food yet   We waited about mins and the food was very tasty  but small portions  Worth the tip  though  Nice to eat somewhere that is that little bit different in style and appraoch  
neutral; Really underwhelmed by food  Good ambiance helped by belly dancer and music  Over   charged per person for  platter  which was  tablespoons of dips and some bread  Under seasoned lamb shank  Better food at Lebanese takeaway in Motspur Park for about    
neutral;  of us had a family get together The restaurant was quite busy   which was understandable for a saturday afternoon in the City  The menu was nothing special The service was good but we had to wait a good while for the food to be brought to the table Some of the food was cold   I think this restaurant caters better for couples and smaller parties  I don t think we would return as a family group We also found it expensive for what was basic italian food   
neutral;We visited the restaurant having been turned away by Riva around the corner  as they were too busy   The fixed price menu sounded ok and our hotel had recommended Jacksons so we decided to give it a go  The staff were welcoming but the service overall was quite old school  The menu is quite expensive but has a good choice  We all opted for the fixed price menu as it sounded the best value  I had stuffed mushrooms which were pleasant if a little under seasoned  My mother had cod loin which looked nice but was served with sweet chilli sauce which had put me off choosing it  For mains I had trout which was nice but a little bland and all mains were served with a dish of mixed veg  carrots  broccoli  green beans  new potatoes and red cabbage  My fiancÇ¸ had lamb and black Pudding casserole which he said was nice but it only contained  pieces of lamb  We all avoided the chicken served with bolognese   The food was fine just a little boring and we felt they could have been a little more adventurous with the sauces and vegetables  The service was quite formal and the decor is a bit bizarre  It really felt like somewhere that hadn t been updated since the s but of you re happy to overlook that it is probably an good option for dinner in Bowness if you don t want Italian food 
neutral; Was very impressed at the new decor  but not by the customer service  It seemed the waiting staff were very young and inexperienced   of us chose  Eat as much  for the   a head  Ordering the Thai Dynasty experience for  only one came out and was told another to follow which took  minutes to arrive  other items came out in dribbs and drabs  some of which never arrived at all  When serving the waiting staff didn t say what the food was  or asked if everything was ok  At the end of our meal we wasn t offered the dessert menu as they were too interested in clearing the tables and setting up for the next day  The food was nice and can t fault the chef  
neutral; Come for the wonderful view and a few decent cocktails  unfortunately the food is mediocre at best and the service is awful 
neutral; After having a couple of great takeaways decided to eat there  The food was fantastic but what lets the place down is that the tables are so close together we felt like we were sat with other people  The restaurant was very busy and although the service was good there was a rushed feeling about it and we wouldnt have felt comfortable sitting after the meal and having another drink  We wouldnt eat there again but would happily have takeaway food as its more relaxed having it at home  Get rid of some of your tables and we would return  
neutral; went here sunday st feb    we were celebrating my mothers  birthday as a family of    We have eaten here on many occasions and always really enjoyed the food and the service   but not this time   Food was still really nice  what spoilt our celebration lunch was the very rude service of our waitress Haley  i can honestly say i have never come accross such a rude person working in hospitality   everything was either a problem or an effort   when there really wasnt either   Out of the  people dining  of us have worked as waitresses so know what we are talking about  you really need to find another job more suited to you haley because this really isnt for you   
neutral; Chips very good  fish greasy  ended up staining my hubbys jeans that ended up in the bin  which was quite surprising with being in a takeaway box  Would still return though  
neutral; A pleasant enough pub but rather dated in decor  layout and quality of food offered  With such a prime countryside location and all the potential custom from city dwellers looking for a  nice meal in a country pub  and the massive increase in passing cyclists we can t help feeling that the pub are missing a trick   if they spent a little money on a more modern  country pub look and upgraded the food offered I think they could become an incredibly desirable venue   fingers crossed that the owner will  take the plunge    could be amazing  
neutral;We ate here twice during our week stay in Bowness on Windermere  The first meal was a family Sunday lunch from the set menu  Both my husband and I chose the carrot and coriander soup for our starter  This was ok but not the tastiest soup and my husband was not impressed  The beef dinner however was very nice  with tender beef and fresh vegetables  We sat inside and the service was very good  especially the older male waiter    Having had a successful meal my husband and I went back two nights later for a romantic dinner  He had booked a table but on arrival we asked if we could sit on the terrace as it was such a nice evening  The blonde waitress rather abruptly said yes but that we would have to come inside to order and pay  So we took the menus outside and chose our meal  My husband went in to order the meal and came back with the drinks  Within a few seconds of sitting back down the waiter came out and asked us to settle our food bill before any food was served due to  new rules  for dinners sat on the terrace  We went along with this but it made us feel a bit awkward as whenever we wanted another drink we had to go in and order as if in a pub  The waiter asked if I would like another glass of wine and when he brought me the bill for this I was also asked if I would like dessert which I then ordered  He came back and asked me if I would like to use the   note I have given him for the wine to cover the dessert as it came to This was handled really awkwardly and gave us the impression they did not trust us to hang around and pay after the meal  Needless to say we left promptly after dessert leaving no tip    If the terrace is not table service  it should be made clearer upon arrival  This is such a shame as the food is very good and good value for money  However the service made us feel uncomfortable and ruined our meal 
neutral; The food is beautiful  we ve been several times and never had a problem with that  However when we came In this time the service wasn t amazing  it wasn t the servers fault  there was only him working but it took quite a while to have our order taken  and get refills on the water  The food portions have definitely gotten smaller however the prices hadn t been reduced to correlate with the smaller size portions since we last came  Even though me and my partner both had  plates each we left still  hungry  I m vegan and there  aren t many places I can eat out so love the fact that this place exists  however I don t think I will be rushing back unless I only want a very light meal  I understand that the food is beautifully cooked and put together however I thought it was overpriced for the  experience  
neutral; This is a nice experience  eating in total darkness  There is not a single ray of light  and this might be very disturbing for some people  The couple sitting next to us had to leave because they could not adjust   It is difficult at first  but we got used to it and it was fun trying to find our plate and cutlery  It was really immersive   The staff was extremely nice and friendly  very smiling and listening to our needs   However  I must say I was really disappointed by the food  I am not fussy at all with food  there are not a lot of things I don t like  But I took the menu  quot chef s surprise quot  and too many things were happening in my mouth in terms of flavours too many different tastes  sweet  savoury    everywhere  I really do not think it was because of the fact we were in the dark and that my taste buds were working more  I truly think some of the stuff that were on my plate should not have been there or mixed with other foods  It was just too much  I ended up eating % of my courses   Overall  this was a nice evening  nice experience  But I did not like the food  Maybe I should have taken another menu  
neutral;This is an award winning restaurant  however I ve been there  times   never really had a great food  it s always been average  The feel ambience of the restaurant is good 
neutral; I wanted a burger and was keen to try here but on reading the menu discovered they only seem to use turkey bacon  a pet hate of mine  so went to Relish instead  Will try again when I do not need bacon in my burger as have heard good things but for all other turkey bacon haters out there be warned 
neutral; I joined a friend for coffee here  The coffee was lovely  but I found the acoustics not conducive to relaxed conversation  The heavy chairs make a lot of noise on the slate floor and we had a wobbly table  There was also noise from cups  saucers and plates being rattled in the service area  We would have chosen to sit outside  but the weather was not favourable  The views however are undeniably wonderful  
neutral;I visited the crab and lobster with friends mid week for a meal  I have heard all the hype and wanted to see for myself if it lived up to it s reputation  unfortunately I was disappointed  The food itself was tasty and the service was good but the actual place doesn t look like it has been cleaned for a decade  It then made me wonder if that is the condition of the public areas  I hate to think what the kitchen and prep areas are like 
neutral; I went on  Friday night looking for a nice cosy spanish tapas restaurant  The restaurant was welcoming and friendly but for some strange reason it was like walking into a canteen  No ambience at all just lots of bright spot lights along with hanging lights it was so bright in there it made it seem like a canteen and not a nice spanish vibe  There was not any music or dimed lights to create a nice atmosphere  The food was v good and the wine  The staff were attentive and very friendly but I wouldn t go back there as it felt all a bit clinical and not spanish shame as such  Simple thing  
neutral; On a recent trip to York  I had decided to visit as many small tea rooms and unique restaurants as I could in a very short timespan  I chose Bullivant of York because it seemed to pop up a lot on  quot Places to Visit quot  topics and forums online  From the outside it ties in well with the quaint charm of York  Inside is very quiet  so don t talk too loudly   and the furnishings were a bit out dated  although not in the quirky way  except for the lovely little garden squeezed in between the tall buildings out the back   unfortunately it was raining when we visited   I ordered the blue stilton and brocolli soup and thoroughly enjoyed it  My Mum ordered a cheese toastie  which was perfectly okay although nothing special  I also ordered a flapjack which was fine  The service was efficient although without a smile and very abrupt at times    Overall we were happy with our visit  even if a bit underwhelmed and wondering what all the fuss was about  
neutral;If you re looking for a cheap lunchtime meal  this may not be for you as the  quot light bite quot  menu is limited  Friendly enough staff  lovely aroma of the rotisserie chicken and comfortable seating  The meal was delicious  I ordered garlic mushroom chicken which came with chips and vegetables The chicken was very tasty but too much for a light bite  The building is new but built in a traditional style  and is very attractive  There is a small children play area near the toilets  and I liked the kitchen window  I would maybe try a Sunday lunch here next time or dinner  but won t be back any time soon for lunch unless they lower the price and size of the portions and offer more lunchtime choice 
neutral;Lovely looking restaurant inside  very spacious and clean  The lady that took our order was really nice and helpful  giving us tips on what to choose  The meal itself was served promptly and my husbands steak was cooked perfectly  I personally would have liked a bit more on my plate  I feel in general that for what we paid it was over priced  I used my Tesco double up vouchers but still ended up having to pay another   on top for  of us 
neutral; It is possibly unfair for me to say this as I did not raise this with the staff at the time but was in a hurry  I had the paprika chicken and some sweet potato fries  The chicken was really not very nice  greasy and a little rubbery  I am not sure what they did to the carrots and potatoes but they were tougher than raw  It was a really odd dish    However the sweet potato fries were fabulous  the Hedgerow cocktail was delicious    I can t comment on the staff as I didn t really get a chance to interact and no one came to ask if the dish was ok even after they collected my plate and it was hardly touched  
neutral; My friends and i were looking for a new place to eat and enjoy a giggle  The Royal Oak seemed a great venue quite near were we all live  Able to park in the car park the welcome wasn t too promising but we carried on   The food was good as there were  of us the choosing of our meal took a while but the waitress was understanding and all was well the drinks came quickly  The service was slow but we will visit again  Cost reasonable and food worth eating  
neutral; We stopped at the barley mow after reading reviews  I was very disappointed the place had no atmosphere the food was average and staff aloof  Is there another barley mow and I went to the wrong one  
neutral;Lovely setting  when it s sunny    Stopped for coffee but unfortunately  large groups of older  quot ladies who lunch quot  had dropped in and pulled lots of tables together so it felt like a noisy school hall  Service was a bit slow as a result  Nice coffee though  the cups had no handles  most strange  A bit of background music would give it a nicer ambience 
neutral;I have been with my family for the Christmas Lunch  When I booked by phone they promised us we would have the christmas cracker on the table but they actually were not there  However the Christmas set menu offered a very good choice at a very good value for moeny but the atmosphere was a bit dull despite the very friendly and genuine service 
neutral;We visited the axe   compass for my nephews th birthday and have to say that the recent changes have sadly not lived up to the self proclaimed hype on the menu  The goats cheese starter was bland and lacking flavour  pate and toast was served either burned on one side or was just sliced white loaf that wasn t toasty at all  Inconsistently inconsistent  Main courses of chicken supreme with cold chorizo  dry burger and boney cod which were all served at intervals meaning vegetables went cold  As usual the bar staff were friendly  it s just a shame that the food quality does not meet the expectation of the inflated menu prices 
neutral;Nice restaurant with simple decoration  friendly staff but I think the food is a bit overpriced for what it is  I had the Gyushabu  hot broth udon with beef  which was really nice  the beef was very tender flavoursome and the broth was good too   Probably not going to visit again because of the price but did not regret the experience 
neutral; Me and my  year old ordered food from here a little slow with service took about  minutes just to come take our drinks order and another  minutes to take our food order but food was lush when it finally came 
neutral; I visited the Winery for the first time last night  with three of my friends for a catch up and a tasty meal  Two of my friends had visited the Winery before and enjoyed a beautiful lunch  and I was anticipating a real treat  First may I say the building is stunning  and I wish it had been light so that I could have seen the grounds which are reportedly pretty  They already had their Christmas decorations up and they were really lovely  and the restaurant had a lovely atmosphere  We ordered our drinks at the bar  and then went through to our table more or less straight away  We took a little time to order our food  our table was booked for : and we ordered about pm  The waitress was very pleasant and arrived quickly with any further drinks that we ordered  We waited about  minutes and our food had not arrived  so we inquired as to how long it would be   a lady came over with an apology and offered us some bread and olives in the meantime  on the house as it would still be a little longer  We accepted as we were very hungry  our food then arrived about :pm   I had ordered a beef burger  and ended up with a blade of beef bourguignon  The waiting staff apologised and I then waited another   minutes for my main  One of my friends had the frittata and felt that it wasn t terribly nice and that there was something missing  Another of my friends had had the fish goujons  and they looked overdone  My main  when it did arrive was nice  but by that point I was very hungry and glad it had come  We then ordered puddings  which again took another  minutes or so to arrive  which seemed disproportionately long as they were only puddings  They were the nicest part of the meal  We then asked for the bill  and found the blade of beef bourguignon on there as well as the beef burger  so do check your bills  We spoke to a lady who looked like the manager after we had paid our bill to give feedback  as we were all feeling disappointed and not what we would have expected from an establishment such as this  She apologised and said that they had had two large parties in before us  however  when we looked at the restaurant there were a lot of empty tables and I wouldn t like to think how long things would take if it was full  Another couple who had been seated after us had already eaten and gone before we had even been served our puddings  She said that if we had spoken up earlier then she may have been able to do something  but we did speak up about the wait before we saw our main meals  All in all  it s a beautiful place but I won t be rushing back as I know other places where I won t be in starvation mode by the time I get my dinner :  
neutral; food looked good  coffee good  a nice chat with staff    would go again  very clean  near everything   would go again   
neutral; We visited the Firehouse Rotisserie on our first night in Bath  The dÇ¸cor is very inviting and the place was busy  even though we decided to eat early  which is always a good sign  The waitress who seated us was friendly and attentive  although perhaps a little reserved for my liking  We decided to go straight for mains  I ordered the lemon and herb half roast chicken and my partner  the rib eye steak  I was a little shocked to find that the prices did not include anything else  chips  salad  so we decided to order a side portion of spicy fries and a salad  Both meals were cooked beautifully  with the steak cooked exactly as ordered  Our meal with  rounds of drinks  one alcoholic  one non alcoholic  came to just over    which seemed a little overpriced considering what we actually ordered and on the second night we had a similar meal for half this  Overall  great food  but rather expensive  
neutral;very expensive for the quality off the food   I had burger chips wasn t overly hot tasted ok wouldn t rush back tho couldn t afford to 
neutral; Food was average  i had the couscous and skewers  overall disappointing as it was very dry  resorted to having to use ketchup which is a shame  not a lot of food for   either  The brownie and ice cream brought it back for me  although for the price it was very minimal  Especially for my partner who had the pecan pie and the malted banana ice cream  which after having worked in an ice cream parlour  i have to say was the smallest scoop of ice cream i have ever seen  I was pretty appalled by the size of food especially for the price  Its clear that the priority is on the decor  creating a trendy ambience  which clearly makes them think they can charge more for less  Overall  I was a bit disappointed and left still hungry  
neutral; After many previous meals here in the past  very good meals  we came here early October for a family meal  We had had a take away from here a couple of weeks prior which was very good  hence us choosing here to go  However  I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed  I had a vegetable korma which was just tasteless  and my cheesy naan bread  which is usually delicious every other time  looked like it had been thrown together and tasted like it too  Out of  of us  only  people enjoyed their meals  Don t get me wrong  usually the food here is fantastic and we have never been disappointed before  the service has always been excellent and a lovely welcoming atmosphere but upon this time we were disappointed and it has put me off returning in all honesty which is a real shame as we were going to book for Christmas Day  
neutral; We visited as a family of  on a Saturday evening  The place was empty aside from us  the music was loud and the staff  quot hung around quot  whilst we ate   a little off putting  We chose items from the  quot all you can eat quot  menu which was varied and seemed good  The starters arrived but were extremely small portions   they barely had enough chicken to skewer for the satay dishes  I didn t even try the sesame prawn toast as it looked awful  I was dreading the main courses to be honest  however  the main courses were very nice indeed   plenty of each dish with good quality ingredients and I loved the Beef with Honey   Chilli Sauce  Overall  a mixed bag of a restaurant resulting in the  quot average quot  review   some nice food but they need to work on their atmosphere and staff interactions with customers  Unfortunately  we won t be returning  
neutral; Surprised to write this but was taken aback by what was on offer  good prices for a take on fast food Chinese  Overall ok and would come back again  
neutral;We had been looking forward to an evening at The Tamarind and picked it for its Michelin star status  We had a table for  on Sat th April  although the service was excellent the food was very much a disappointment  I like chicken tikka masala  and at The Tamarind they had used chicken thigh meat instead of breast  which made the dish slimy in texture and the sauce was not smooth and tasty but thick  lumpy and not much of it  Another of our main courses was a lamb dish and the cubes of lamb were full of gristle and fat  Finally after going through the wine list and they were all very expensive  we chose the cheapest bottle of white and cheapest bottle of red to be told they had run out of them  so we had to end up spending   per bottle of wine which we would we would never ordinarily spend so much on a bottle of wine 
neutral; thought the food was ok and the prices good to match  would recommend to anyone to go and give it a try  
neutral; Fook ok  decor tired  Not bad for a pub lunch but not my first choice  
neutral; Interesting visit to this pub  First of all there was no Camembert for starters  I thought no problem so ordered something else  Main food came out and my husband had the wrong pie  the waitress said enjoy your meal and I was sat there without a meal  I said excuse me but I ordered fish and chips  Der  She didn t even notice  Anyway they had forgot my meal and I had to wait while my husband and daughter ate theirs  Not happy  
neutral; We went to the Rising Sun for the first time sinceit s face lift  Now owned by OHH pubs which we enjoy in Chew Magna we decided to come here on their promo steak night as closer to home  We were sadly disappointed  It was a wet November night  The first thing we noticed was that neither the wood burner nor the fire were lit  the wrong wood apparently  There were a few people in but this is a large spaceand it was definitely not cosy  We sat in the retaurant biut would probably have done better in the bar as the spaces were smaller  We did not take off our coats as none of the radiators were on  The staff who are running around are fine and can warm up in the kitchen but for customers on a slow night the same cannot be said  The good point was a carpet  warmer than stone  which absorbs sound should it ever be full and noisy   OHH have a good formula on the food and we shared good tempura prawns to start followed by various steaks cooked to our order which were good   A trip to a pub or restaurant is not just about the food  The design  decor and layout are very important  Sadly good food cannot make up for cold and lack of atmosphere  We may return in the summer when this won t matter as much  Until then there are many cosy places with good food as close to home   To cap this we were overcharged for the wine this we were told because the button on the til wasn t working properly  If you know this don t you check the customer s bill before waiting to see if they notice or not  
neutral; the chef on this occasion was unfriendy and very mean with the meat unlike other occasions when we have visited very few waitresses on but Anne was rushed off her feet the vegetables seemed over cooked and a little old please standardise the portions so you know what you will get  
neutral; Christmas night out at Roberto s  Gary Barlow Look a like was excellent  the food was dreadful  first time at Roberto s at Ocean Plaza  Lasagne was tomato soup with pasta sheets floating in it  the tiramisu was stale cake covered in cream  Never faulted the food at Robertos on Lord street   
neutral; Ate here a couple of times as my husband and I were staying at the nearby Wolverley campsite  Dog friendly  dogs allowed in the bar area  Outside seating overlooking the lock which was a nice way to spend an hour or so over lunch  Had baguettes and a portion of chips each  portions so large we could have shared one portion and we have very good appetites  Also ate here one evening and had the burgers which were average  Worth a visit  
neutral; We visited Bills for scones and cake on a Saturday afternoon  The location is nice  especially now the Christmas lights are up   We all ordered the  scones  plus cream and jam  with a slice of Victoria sponge  two of us had the elderflower fizz with it  Scones were delicious and the elderflower fizz is really gorgeous  and a nice alternative to just prosecco  Just to warn you  you need a really sweet tooth to eat all these treats and I found it a sugar overload  although my friends managed fine  The only downside of our visit was the really sloppy service  We waited ages for anyone to take our order even though staff were free  Then they arrived with the wrong order  My friend who asked for the non alcoholic drink had to wait a very long time to get it and had to remind them  The staff were polite and friendly  just not on the ball  
neutral;Visited  quot  L Artista quot  again recently  as I have done many times before  but as it s a dependable   local standby   it s never occurred to me to give it a review before  To rectify matters  here goes   The restaurant is located at a very busy spot and a not particularly endearing one  bit rough round the edges and slap bang near a rumbling railway bridge  Not a first date or romantic evening setting at all  Having said that  it s really handy for Golders Green and  therefore all public transport   and if you re coming by car it s a really busy road  but you can usually snick in further down if you re prepared to walk for a couple of mins   As with the location the pizzeria itself is not the type of place for an intimate or vaguely formal meal  It s large  bustling  loud  garlicky and frantic   with tiled floor  bare ish tables  cheap napkins and frantic  mostly Italian  staff  Having said that  its less positive points are  ironically  what draws a lot of customers TO the place  including me   The chaotic bustle and noisy buzz are greaf fun  if you re in the mood   Regarding the food  there is an immense italian pizzeria menu with something for everyone  It moves from antipasti  to salate  to pastas  pizzas of every type and variety  prima piatti  side dishes and desserts  the latter being formulaic with photos and descriptions     Also  I get the feeling that if you fancied something a bit different  they d probably try to pull it out of the hat for you  It s nothing spectacular in either cooking  ingredients or presentation   but it s good portions  really tasty  reliable quality  very reasonable prices and  to give them their due   the pizzas ARE worth travelling for  Appearance  size  taste etc  etc    you could be sitting in Naples  rather than a steamy conservatory overlooking the Finchley Road    Try it in the right frame of mind and you ll come away feeling full  not too broke and declaring that you ll probably return   as most folks tend to  
neutral; Unfortunately I think this place is becoming a victim of its own success  we couldn t wait to eat up and leave as the restaurant literally was full of women and we all Know how noisy we can be en masse  Food nothing special unfortunately  the hummus was bland and greasy and there weren t enough loos  I may be being harsh and I d be prepared to give this place another go if I knew it wasn t going to be full of drunken women  maybe it s an acoustics thing  
neutral; Not as good as our local midland fish and chip shop  Just had cod and chips  Had to put on our own salt and vinegar  
neutral; We often meet up with our friends at Humphrey Bean for breakfast  Such value for money and the breakfast is good  Lovely bacon and great hash browns  It is so spacious and we can sit and chat over our food without feeling pressurized to eat and go  With the skylight  it is also bright and airy  
neutral; I enjoyed the meal here and so did my  friends   Although we all only had a main course each plus drinks as we were in a hurry  we all enjoyed it   no complaints :   Only problem was that there was nowhere nearby to park my car   hey ho 
neutral; We had booked this as a pre theater dinner meal  We had the setter menu which was really disappointing  I ordered the saladof beetroot and watercress  And that is what it was  A few straggly bits of watercress thrown over some beetroot   Three of us had the same main of leek gratin and salad  Quite tasteless and the salad was just a bowl of of old lettuce leaves so really disappointing   Maybe the main menu is better and nicely presented  I know the pre set dinners are limited but this was poor   The waitress who served us was very business like and came across as quite rude   The setting was nice and airy and an outside seating area which overlooks Covent Garden  
neutral; I came here with a group of work colleagues for a meal at Christmas  The food was good basic pub fare  There were about  of us and no one had any complaints  Service was ok  price ok   middle of the road on all counts really  
neutral; I ordered Burrito and received Fajita  We waited and waited for our drinks order as the staff chatted at the bar  We are an older couple and got the feeling they really weren t interested in serving us because we weren t hip enough  All very disappointing  
neutral;The staff were extremely rude ad unplesant the food was amazing but was spoilt by the way our waitress treat us and made us feel 
neutral; We have had many meals at this pub over the years  It seems to have changed hands as now table service and change of menu  as well as some new staff  We opted for the  for   meals which were OK   we have had better meals at this pub in past visits  Tables were clean but sticky  Not very inspiring visit  
neutral; This Pub is situated in a wonderful unspoilt village  However I feel it does not make the best of it s situation  Cannot comment about the food as not served throughout all of the day  So none available when we visited  pm  This place obviously makes money from its situation  but made us feel unwelcome and as if we were nuisances  For a village that is a MAJOR tourist attraction very disappointing 
neutral;Difficult to get a reservation and difficult to find the location  But was worth it  The best sushi experience  The staff were lovely  and the fish so fresh   amazing   They made our dinner was exclusive 
neutral; I have been to Bill s on several occasions  The atmosphere has been lively  the staff tidy and attentive and the food of a high standard  which all added to the ambience within  Unfortunately  after last week  I will no longer be visiting Bill s  The standards have fallen drastically in the last two years  but after each visit  when something had not been to standard  I decided it was just bad luck  and everyone has a bad day  On my last visit  my  quot Bills quot  breakfast was very hard and appeared to have been reheated  The wall next to my table was splattered with food and drink stains and seemed to have been there some time  The staff  whilst pleasant  really need to tie their hair back  Cleaning standards and the quality of food  form the foundation of any food outlet  If these basic regulations cannot be achieved  I really feel that a business should change management or close    
neutral;We were welcomed by a friendly and efficient waitress who also took our drinks order  She also gave us extra time to read the wide range of menu choices  So far so good  Our olives didn t arrive until after our starters  but we did get an apology  I opted for the fixed price menu of  courses for    My starter was delicious: goats cheese on brioche with red onion chutney however there was only   slice of the bread which was disappointing  perhaps due to the fixed price menu    We waited absolutely ages for our mains  despite the restaurant not being busy  to the point that I was starting to think about leaving  My salmon and dill fishcakes were deep fried and beyond golden brown  so looked less appetising  To be honest  not as nice as Sainsbury s own  Served with chips and rocket and attractively presented  My husband really enjoyed his meal and the children s craft table was a lovely touch  but I could face the wait for desert  Perhaps it was an off day 
neutral;A really nice place with lots of quirkiness  We visited as part of a friend s and family group to celebrate a birthday    The Emporium was extremely busy   A table booked in advance and we were waiting over an hour to be shown to our table  Waited another hour for our food  which was nothing to write home about   Granted we were given a couple of bottles of wine for our inconvenience    Maybe a daytime visit would be better  
neutral; We visited the beefeater as a family of  yesterday evening and had a very enjoyable experience with regards to our server  Emma  and the food that we received  But I will warn anyone not to sit near the kitchen as all night we were greeted with silly noises that the staff were making throughout the entire time   it is such a shame that the food and service was let down by what we can describe as immature behavior  We will be visiting again but hopefully not sitting by the kitchen  
neutral; Perfectly good brasserie in Central Leeds  Part of the D D stable but not a patch on some of their London offerings such as Pont de la Tour  
neutral; Did not have any food  just drinks  The bar was busy and there were three bar staff on  Often checked phones while people were waiting and smacked gum while serving  Often wandered off to be told to come back on the bar  reluctantly doing so  Unhappy unfriendly and felt like I was putting them out asking them for a drink  Pity as the bar decor is nice and comfortable  quickness of cleaning was an issue as well as dirty plates from previous customers was left on our table all night  
neutral;the doner box servings have gone smaller and i was disappointed that my chips appeared to be hard old
neutral;I know what you mean re the owner and the tone she works under and as its a small shop you do feel involved and you try to relax and enjoy the good food  Lovely soups but as we visited today found the shop deserted and emptied out    Does anyone know if it s closed down or undergoing a re fit   Enjoyed a wonderful lunch up the road from there at the Creams cafe  I think it s called  Beautiful in there 
neutral;First visit since New Year  Food was very tasty but the menu is quite limited   considerable overlap between starters and mains so we only had one course  Disappointing selection of beer but the Lech Ale was good  Reading the reviews it seems the pub has been affected by management changes   this is a shame as this is a lovely pub with great potential  Lets hope it is on the up again now 
neutral; Lovely seafood   but the view is what you come here for  they dont cater for teenagers    no %beef burgers   
neutral;We went on a stormy evening thinking it would be nice to eat and watch the rolling waves  Well we did that but came away feeling a bit non plussed  The decor is lovely  it s a nice place to sit in  but the staff don t seem to give a toss  No greeting  no smile  no niceties  I ve had better service in the canteen at Ikea  The battered cod is gorgeous  but the chips tasted like frozen chips and had an unpleasant texture  Eating out of a cardboard box is awkward  It costs twice as much as other fish and chip shops in the area  so it should be better  and sadly it isn t   minutes walk away you can pay half the price  get your food served on plates  and receive service with a smile  Walk past  chip fans  go elsewhere 
neutral;When they have decent beer on  then it s served well  sign of a good cellar   Funny how the staff often disappear when customers walk in   The food is OK a lot is microwaved tho  staff appear efficient enough    
neutral; Too expensive  Din t taste like anything special  You can make better ice cream deserts your self at home  
neutral; I found Martinos a bit disappointing  i was recommeded to go here by several friends and have visited on different occasions to see if the poor service we had recieved was usual or not  as the first visit was around Christmas time and I thought the service may have been poor due to the high volume of customers  the food was average and the service was poor to average on both occassiona so probably wouldnt go back  
neutral; First night in looe and wanted some where to eat    This little place looked ideal with a tasty menu    Hadn t booked and it was a Saturday night and it was busy   they asked us to return in half hour    Cosy little place inside  if a bit cramped Ordered lasagne and chips and others in party ordered makeral starters and fish and chips    Lasagne was tasty chips were also nice but a bit cold Only downfall was the service    Bit slow as it was only her rd night    Would eat there again 
neutral; We visited as a group of six on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was busy  Our young waitress was very charming and helpful  and she dealt with the complaints two of our group had with their steaks  the rib eye    Overall the food was good  The starters got full marks  mains were a mixed bag  neither of the regular rib eye eaters were impressed  and deserts were decent  We d chosen a  courses for   deal from the menu  Although you could pay a supplement for some steaks  others were excluded totally  There were also other supplements for sauces and sides which I thought were on the expensive side for a tiny jug of not much to write home about peppercorn sauce    Other reviews on here have mentioned the bar area which we found a bit intrusive to our booth near the main entrance  People kept using the back of our booth to lean on and rest their drinks  as it was natural to do so to make the most of the view  Also mentioned was the outdoor area which we didn t spend much time in  however this now has heaters   All in all I think this place is a work in progress and the reviews so far seem to reflect that  in that comments are being heard and addressed  Next changes should include normal shaped plates  our group struggled with six mains on rectangular plates on our cramped circular table   proper water jugs  ours came in an odd sports style bottle  and a revisit of the menu  which could do with being more keenly priced to keep people coming back  
neutral; We visited Red Mezze for an early evening meal after being recommended by family   The restaurant seems well maintained  clean and tidy throughout  Unfortunately  my partners  starter was not fully cooked through and was cold in the middle but our waiter was very apologetic and provided a complimentary salad to come with our mains   The food was otherwise good and the portions reasonable    I will probably try some of the other Mediterranean restaurants in town before returning  but if you re in the area and fancy something Greek Turkish  you could certainly do worse  
neutral; I enjoyed the views  the service is excellent  but the food is overpriced and not that good  I ordered the Duck  which is supposed to be served pink  not rare  I did send it back to be cooked more  however was still disappointed when it returned  I ate it because I was hungry  Also the lighting is not very good  hence you cannot see what you are eating  I was surprised that with such a good location  the place was so empty on a Wednesday night with only three tables  Given that it is holiday season  just before airshow weekend  I expected it to be a lot busier  I have eaten here before and enjoyed it  but was left feeling hungry and unsatisfied with a   bill on my last visit  
neutral;According toy mandarin teacher it is and it s not bad I have to agree  Service is very  quot Chinese quot  though and the ambience is not charming although original  Cheap for a quick snack better places nearby if you wanna a proper meal   
neutral;The Fleece is a lovely setting   with a roaring fire indoors  a beer garden on the river outdoors    with very nice bathrooms  a cosy side room  dogs allowed and walkers welcome  and good food  Sadly  it often lacks a buzz  as the place is large and frequently rather empty  The food is excellent but the service sometimes deficient  slow  not good on providing information    not good for vegetarians either  Nice  warm  cosy pub   but bring a crowd to have a good night 
neutral; i felt that i had to go to Nandos after hearing so much about it so i made it my mission during half term  on arrival we waited a few minutes to gain the attention of the staff who were waiting on  it was clear that we had been noticed but we were just left hanging around by the front door  We were then offered a table upstairs and when we sat down we just had  menus plonked in front of me and my daughter  only for her having visited beforehand i would not have known how the ordering process began  Also our table was dirty and i pointed this out to a member of staff who just said oh ok  I went to the counter and began to order the waitress again was not very helpful just repeated back to me my order and gave me  glasses to get my drinks  We were very hungry and we were finding the wait for our food quite annoying but we just sat and chatted between ourselves  i did feel the need to complain when after  minutes we still had no food and bearing in mind we had only ordered  chicken wraps and chips with sides of coleslaw and the restaurant was not overly busy i did find this unacceptable  When the food finally came it was just bog standard and resembled what any fast food outlet could churn out in  minutes   the food was nice but not that nice to wait so long for and to pay   for  
neutral; I was disappointed with my visit to this restaurant  The food is nice enough but nothing special considering the prices  With an expensive restaurant I would expect something more in terms of the atmosphere and customer service  The manager was particularly condescending when questioning why  ingredients listed on the menu description were not present on the plate and I think he certainly needs a refresher in customer service which would hopefully then filter down to the rest of the staff  This restaurant is certainly not the best in Worcester and would not be the one that I would recommend for people visiting the city  
neutral; I visited here last night with my parents  they re regulars and this was their th visit  Unfortunately we were massively let down by the service  We were given our drinks quickly but it then took them  minutes to take our food order  we had to ask the waiter to come over   They then over cooked the steak and didn t bring the side of chips we d asked for   My starter of baked asparagus and main of linguine with scallops was absolutely delicious and we were given a shot of limoncello each at the end as we d been let down by the service   I d go back as the food was good and my parents have said the service is usually great  but they should have communicated if they were short staffed  There was a guy on another table complaining about the service too  Hopefully just a one off  
neutral; We were greeted quickly and with a smile    The food was not great the nachos were very dry and like cardboard   Jack Daniels chicken strips were OK although my daughter had far more than I did on my plate    But they were tasty   I ordered wine which tasted more like vinegar   after mentioning this a nice lady called Claire came over and apologised and opened a new bottle to which wasn t much better   however after trying a couple of different wines we found one that suited   Our experience was enhanced by Claire as she was very bubbly and helpful and took the time to make sure we were totally happy   Thank you Claire 
neutral;Went to The George for a pre cinema meal  The service was slow and we had to queue to be seated even though we only wanted a bar meal  There were only  people behind the bar  so we also had to wait to get a drink  We ordered a sharing platter as we only wanted a light bite  The presentation was good but there was quite a lot of bread  We had ordered triple cooked chips but they were just like ordinary chips which came in a little bucket lined with greaseproof  the whitebait was served in the same way   not many when you tipped them out  With everything but the pate being served in dishes on the board there actually wasn t a great amount and the prawns in the cocktail were still frozen   not the best experience I m afraid 
neutral; Me   my friend came in on Tuesday evening  It wasnt overly busy  We had a waiter who not sure if he cracked a smile or not  Food was excellent  I always have pasta   really enjoy zizzi s generally  I did enjoy the food but felt like we were a bit in   out   Better atmosphere at Woking    friendlier service   I will try again  as its really local for me  
neutral; The service was very good and staff friendly  Meal spoilt by too much batter and probably not enough fish  Plates could be bigger so you have room to manouvre  Met some good company 
neutral; We popped in here a few days ago based on the reviews on TA and I honestly couldn t see what made it so good    We had a cream tea  but there was no choice of scone or any butter  and a panini that for nearly   was very small and bland    The ceiling display was very pretty and there were lots of options for drinks but otherwise very very average  
neutral; I have been very happy with this bistro in the past but  of my friends and I went in there last Friday and have to say the service was very poor  My friend s order was wrong  salmon instead of cod  and then the staff lied about it by saying that there was only one portion left  which I had   My friend rightly asked why they didn t say that before and asked her for an alternative on the menu instead of given her salmon she didn t want  The waiters than said there was another piece of cod in the freezer they could prepare  why wasn t that done in the first place    Our main waiter then owned up a mistake was made  wrong order entered on the computer   We asked for a discount  which should have been offered by that point   because of the inconvenience caused and because we couldn t eat at the same time  The waiter only offered us %  At the end of meal after coffee they brought us  not very nice  liquor  When the bill came there was no % discount and the waiter said he assumed that as the coffee was on the house and we had free liquors  this was ok  We never asked for the liquors and couldn t even drink it  We let it go in the end as it looked that the waiter had very little control over the decision but we were very disappointed and may not go again which is a shame  It was a poor decision by the restaurant   we perfectly accept mistakes are made  but they should have owned up to the mistake  offered us a decent discount and stuck to it  However  reading some of the other reviews  it sounds like there is a tension between staff and management  so not blaming the staff really as they were very pleasant  Shame on the management though  
neutral; I ve been here a few times now and never had a bad meal  It is what it is  cheap and cheerful  There are a few mixed reviews but I think you need to try it for yourself  I avoid this place in the summer just because it gets very busy and that s when the waiting takes forever and the meals don t seem as great  
neutral; Had my first visit here last week  Walked in and asked if they took card  the girl just answered  No   So myself and my friend went to find a cash machine and returned in spite of her rudeness  The surroundings were lovely given that they had not long had a refurb  The menu was quite disjointed with no real headings and salads mixed in with the breakfast items etc  Decided on a toastie which was nice  my friend had a chicken mayo baked potato which she said was a little dry  but the portion size was good  Fancied a sweet treat afterwards but there was just three jars on top of the counter which I could not see properly but assumed had cake in  Walked further down the road to find a chocolate fix  
neutral; good home cooked food nothing fancy very good tea time menu but such a shame the service isnt as good  not thhe first time we have been and the service hasnt got any better  we had to ask after  minutes if they would take our order then after the starters were taken away  minutes later we had to ask how long the main would take only to be told the people on the other table were to be served then us wouldnt have minded but they arrived  minutes after us  
neutral; I ate here on a busy Friday   no complaints about food but it took ages to get to us  The waiter was apologetic and offered us a drink on the house  
neutral;I know alot of people in my family who rave about Al Fornos  but they know the management I don t really get the fuss  When AL Fornos first opened we went every other week the food was delicious and we were so relieved to have a nice Italian in the town  Whilst the cocktail bar is really good   I feel that the quality of the food has got worse over time  Out of  girls only  of us really enjoyed our meals  The pizza is lovely and so are chicken dishes and salads  Pasta is pasta and very little else  The restaurant itself is LOUD and you do have to shout for conversation which again   I don t mind   but could be improved  Staff are rushed to death  i work in this sort of environment myself so I understand how stressful it is to be as rushed as they are but they could at least try to hide it better as it is obvious that they are rushed  under pressure  The general feedback from the rest of the girls I was with was that the attitude of our waitress was really poor   I d go back to Al Fornos don t get me wrong for a picky lunch and bottle of wine but I wouldn t use it again for a special birthday or occasion 
neutral; You just have to be lucky to catch it doing both of those things at the same time   There doesn t seem to be any published opening times or food serving times so I find it complete pot luck as to when I can get something to eat here which is very frustrating   
neutral; We had seen this pub on the internet as  one to visit   It was OK but a bit like walking into a time warp  The decor was very s s with wallpaper that had a  sponging  effect of yellow and red  The carpet again was very dated a deep red pile and the music was Stock  Aitken And Waterman  not that there s anything wrong with that  Just setting the scene :   Having said all that it wasn t uninviting and was very clean and well lit and the service was good  The wine was cheap but I detected that it wasn t %  tasted more like %  so that probably explains the cost  
neutral; I went here on Saturday for a meal  The first thing we noticed was how close the tables were to each other  I understand the restaurant is small so they don t have a lot of space to work with but its nice to be separated from other diners    There were a few mistakes made in terms of our food order however they quickly fixed them and made sure the correct food was brought out very quickly  I can t fault the service there    The food was very nice and the portions were a good size as a lot of the time you end up with way too much food    When the bill arrived  we had been charged for one of the incorrect items  the guy serving us seemed a little annoyed when we mentioned this and had it removed from the bill  this could have been handled in a more professional manner    Overall it was a lovely evening but the atmosphere and service could do with improvement  
neutral; Staff rushed and under pressure Asked for salt and pepper twice   it never came  Mussels as a starter were half empty   just shells  but food on the whole good  
neutral;The waiter was at the end of his shift and in his haste to get way the wrong dish was brought  The other  in the party were served and I had to wait  minutes for mine  by which time  the rest had finished  Good food though  and to be fair the girl that took over our service was charming and efficient 
neutral; We had high hopes for this place  We went for a birthday lunch  and when we looked at the menu it all sounded so promising   We ordered the classic double cheeseburger  and the Dirty buffalo chicken sandwich   The chicken sandwich it actually took me a while to even find the chicken in it   one tiny piece  Mostly coleslaw and a couple bits of bacon  Pretty disappointing to have to hunt for the chicken in a chicken sandwich   The burger was ok  but just ok   We also ordered a couple of sides   the mac n cheese balls  though we ended up with just regular mac n cheese   Chicken wings and fries  The chicken wings were the best part of the meal   huge and pretty tasty   The server asked us if we wanted  or   but didn t explain that they were bigger than average  so the  ended up being totally unnecessary  they weren t cheap   felt like a waste   Overall  a pretty disappointing experience  I d expected much better  
neutral;We ate here for both evening meal and breakfast  and found it to be ok but no more than that  The breakfast was very good  both cooked and cold selections  the evening meals were ok but over priced   and over cooked in the case of my fish   Service was very good though  the waiting staff were always very helpful   Not a bad location  but does look a little tired inside   definitely change that carpet   and needs a little sprucing up 
neutral; This is a great place to take children as there is so much for them to pick from along with sweets  It is a little bit like a school dinner hall and the staff are always looking to clear your table and hurry you along  As my children are now older  There is nothing that would make me return as  adults  Otherwise good value  
neutral; nice pub the staff was very friendly but not that busy for a weekend for some reason  and the food look good from what i saw 
neutral; Visited the liversedge on    nice pub  restaurant good service  food very average could do with a better selection of real ale never heard of the beers on offer  
neutral; On arrival it was clear to see that their normal clientele were much older than us  Wayne was very friendly with us but I felt as a young family  both  with our  month old daughter  we were looked down on by the lady who runned it  Tina  she was very abrupt with us and would only talk to us when it was needed  it was very uncomfortable  The room was spotless but very small  for what we paid I would of expected bigger  there was plenty of tea  coffee  hot chocolate etc  we didn t use them as the kettle took so long to boil  the matteres was so hard it was like lying on the floor so we didn t get much sleep  in lew of this we were looking forward to a nice big breakfast  we had to choose a time to attend the bar to eat  we arrived right on time  we were obviously the last ones there  we were told where to sit  there were no menus for breakfast but a table of cereal and just the option of a full English  we weren t asked how we would like our eggs or bacon cooked  The breakfast was nice but would ve liked more  again because of what we paid  We didn t spend much of our days there as we were out exploring Devon  we also ate out both nights as apposed to eating in their bar  due to it been a little too expensive for us and also feeling too uncomfortable around the staff  All in all it was a bit of a let down  we won t be staying here again  
neutral; I found the tea gardens a pleasant haven on a hot day  The waitress welcomed me with a smile and service was efficient   The coffee cake was delicious  It was also helpful that dogs were allowed  i would visit again  
neutral;The food is very tasteful and the hot plates are of good quantity  The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite cold and not really welcoming  I normally take away for two reasons  It s more expensive to sit in and it s also cold in temperature most of the times 
neutral; My mother  daughter and friends visited today for lunch and were very disappointed   We spent about   minutes queuing to be served when there looked to be lots of staff but only one taking orders  Whilst ordering we were then informed that the card machine was not working  There should have been information up informing people of this so they didn t waste time queuing if they did not have cash to pay with   I ordered Welsh rarebit and when it arrived it was just cheese on toast with some Worcester sauce on the top    If you want a pudding  desert after and don t buy it at the same time as your meal  you are then expected to queue up again for another   minutes before being served   We have been here in the past and the service was much better as was the food  Unfortunately after today we will not be visiting again to eat and I would not recommend it  
neutral; Camped in the attached campsite for  nights  Ate in the pub twice  First day we had the gourmet burgers  They were excellent  homemade and not overcooked  We like our burgers juicy and the add on were good quality plus lovely chips  Ate again another evening  pie and chips and fish and chips  both good meals but we were disappointed with the dessert  We both wanted sticky toffee pudding but it was finished so we had tiramisu which was not as expected and it had a hard pastry crust and had no taste of toffee or bananas which I thought were the flavours of tiramisu  Well kept cellars and nice beer and cider  Best to skip desserts  
neutral; Lovely idea but quite tight in area and food and drink very basic and expensive   staff obviously not used to catering  
neutral;  st sep   Firstly we were attracted to this place because of it s beautiful views over the lake and thought it would be a prefect place to enjoy our meal  When we were seated and our orders had been taken the drinks were quick to arrive  and then there seemed to be a long wait for anything else to happen  I counted myself Five members of staff stood at the bar chatting away amongst themselves doing very little  whilst we were sat wondering whether we had been forgotten about  we actually discussed just paying for our drinks and leaving  Eventually a member of staff came over and asked if we were finished    even though we hadn t actually got any food yet  We were startled that we had waited so long and yet no one seemed to be bothered about our order  I have worked myself waitressing and I know that in busy times orders can be misplaced or forgotten but I would hardly say the place was heaving  I was really disappointed that a place with such idyllic views of the lake would be such a let down   And as for the staff there must have been one member of staff to each person sat eating   
neutral; I came in with my friends a few days ago and I have to say I was disappointed in the waiting staff  We came on Thursday during the day  there were hardly any tables in as everyone is still in work school  We were put into a section and everything was fine  The food was perfect and I cannot fault it  However the young man who took our food order looked like he couldn t have cared less about his job  Our empty plates were left on our table even though the blonde lady who appeared to be a manager of some sort walked past  times and didn t even attempt to move them  We ordered pudding and had to move the plates onto the table behind    of the plates were then only removed from the other table once our puddings were brought out  Out of the many staff members who were on we only felt welcomed by two  Unfortunately we did not get their names  Again  we could not fault the food  But the waiting staff need to up their game  
neutral;Advised to visit as great value and service  Waited ages to get service  Vert tatty not sure when the picture was taken but definitely no way as clean and tidy as picture  scruffy dirty carpet and very cramped  Server not happy that we asked for new cutlery as given ones were dirty still  need to be more careful when washing up  Service too slow and quite expensive so will not be returning as sadly felt very ignored and felt let down after rave reviews given : 
neutral; My Husband and I ate here over the festive period and really enjoyed it  It was a tuesday evening  and the Quayside in general was very quiet  but we decided upon eating at Rani by location and looking at the menu on the outside  When we went in  there was only one other couple dining  and we were seated nearby them  They were a couple of courses ahead of us  so after they left  we were dining in the whole restaurant on our own  Overall though  the food was good  and we thoroughly enjoyed it  The service was quick  the decor was bright and clean  and the food was reasonably priced  There are other Indian Restaurants I would love to go to before I would go back here  but don t dismiss this place    
neutral; If you re here for a meal  it s pretty average  The dimsums are very similar to the frozen ones you get in an Asian supermarket  I wouldn t choose to come to this place for food  
neutral; Had dinner here  generous portions  good quality  Service good and plenty of parking  Nice atmosphere  
neutral;There is a nice relaxed ambience about the place in the evening for drinks and tapas    The menu isn t extensive but there are enough dishes to please most palates and we have yet to try some of them  Our favourite tapas is the bread with alioli  squid and chorizo lollipops but we ll avoid the scallops in future 
neutral; Despite being a Saturday  we arrived here without a booking but were greeted warmly and were given a table    We had an enjoyable starter and main course  The atmosphere was great and overall I found this a pleasant experience  The owner was attentive to our dishes and on more than one occasion did he come over to have a chat and see that everything was to our satisfaction  
neutral; We were greeted by a very pleasant gentleman who served us our drinks and pointed out the specials to us  which were all pies We had a cheese and onion pie and a steak  We were the only people eating in the pub but they took ages to arrive  The vegetables were stone cold unfortunately  The cheese pie was nice and the steak was cooked as we had asked it to be but the chips were a bit undercooked   The bill was very reasonable but the meal wasn t up to scratch   We probably won t return  
neutral;Ok  so she had probably had a busy day as the Christmas Market was on but this lady was really unpleasant  If we hadn t been freezing cold and starving we would have walked out but I m glad we didn t  The roast beef dinner was well worth it   plenty of meat  freshly cooked vegetables etc  Worth going for the nice lunch but pop your head around the door first to check whether you will be snarled at 
neutral;Came here with my partner for lunch and we unfortunately came when it was someones birthday because it was so noisy and their shouting was off putting   The food was great though and affordable  If we come again hopefully it will be quieter 
neutral;I don t normal join group like this but I feel if I don t speak up for these poor girls then it will continue to happen We arrived at the plough inn on Friday we had foods in the pub that was lovely a young man brought are food to us he was well presented and knew his job   for a treat we decide to take are children to the wacky warehouse   we were pleasant surprised there was a fantasy disco on and it was cheap to get in plus there was nibbles and games for the kids   we were all enjoying are self when a large women came in and started shouting at the young girls behind the counter   she was vile the girl looked absolutely petrified of her  I was that concerned I asked the young girl if she was OK as did some of the other people in there  I don t know what the women s name was but I heard some say she wasn t the manager thank god   if that the kind of people you employee then good luck   I ll be very shocked to see if those girls are still there if we ever return
neutral; I wanted to treat my boyfriend to a teppenyaki meal as I had previously been to Benihana  back in the day in Swiss cottage  and loved it  I found a voucher on  Living Social  for a three course teppanyaki meal for two with a cocktail for Sen Nin at the Islington branch  Admittedly the Camden branch had better reviews but they were fully booked for that evening  a Saturday night   We were seated relatively promptly and our starters and drinks arrived very quickly  The waiters were friendly and the food was ok  But what was disappointing was the lack of a show  Teppenyaki is meant to be about entertainment as well as the food  The food was average at best  I opted for steak and my boyfriend had the salmon  but the chef failed to perform more than one trick  This would have been alright to deal with had we not seen the table near us be entertained with various tricks and delights  I think this was due to the fact that our table was the  voucher table   but why advertise your restaurant for a voucher deal if you don t want to provide the full service to customers  We were disappointed to say the least and I don t think we will be coming back here again  
neutral; I met a friend here for tea and cake    There was a large selection of delicious delights for us to choose from and my earl grey tea one of the nicest I ve tried   sadly they don t sell it in the garden centre   I asked   I find the restaurant lacks something   I m not sure what it is but it seems to feel a little soul less   Apart from that it was all fine   The staff were friendly and chatty   
neutral;Before going here I had read all the trip advisor reviews and had therefore prepared myself for a flop but actually I was pleasantly surprised  There was a queue when we arrived but it quickly went down and we were seated within about  mins  We ordered and the food arrived within about  mins  I had enough time to feed my baby  My husband and I had a banana split and Oreo waffle between us and it was good  Very naughty but just what we wanted  The staff were friendly enough  I do agree that some of the footwear of some had seen better days so maybe just a smarten up of that needed but no real complaints here  Will be returning for sure 
neutral; disappointing service with too many mistakes on the bill  no apologies or acknowledgement  Waiter could hardly understand my english guests 
neutral; We booked a table for my daughters th birthday family meal  we were placed in the doorway in between the bar and play area  which wasn t ideal as people were pushing to get past throughout the meal  The restaurant was busy and the place was clearly understaffed  I felt extremely sorry for the waiting staff as you could clearly see they were rushed off their feet and were taking the brunt of the customers anger  We queued longer to order the food than the food took to arrive from the kitchen  The food was just average  nothing special and in fact a few of our party had a few complaints but didn t want to queue in the long queue to complain to staff  The toilets were disgusting  My daughter refused to use the children s toilets as the floor was soaking in what I m hoping was water  My husband took her the the male toilets to discover they were twice as bad  he alerted a member of staff who said they would get someone to clean them  The female toilets were also a state with no toilet roll in  out of  cubicles  Overall I would not visit this restaurant again and would highly recommend they hire more staff  
neutral; We booked as a family for my fathers th Birthday  the setting was lovely but unfortunately the food was very disapointing The roast beef was overcooked and in short supply and the potatoes   Veg had oviously been kept warm for quite a while On the standard of the food it was overpriced and poor quality which was a shame as it was for a special occasion  
neutral; Visited on a sunny Saturday at pm with husband  Have dined here several times  but not for a couple of years  Few people in pub  but not too busy  Clean   well decorated  Nice outdoor seating  but on a busy road  Toliets appear clean  but absolutely stink   always have  quite off putting   Despite being nd in the queue  we had a  minute wait at the bar to order   collect drinks  This has always been a problem here   there is only ever a couple of staff   they re always so slow   disinterested   My husband ordered a chilli hotdog  which wasn t available  So instead chose a hotdog with cheese   I had chicken kiev  Food came out within  minutes  but my husband s meal was wrong  different topping on hotdog   Always annoying  but the waitress apologised   swopped it within  minutes  Food was tasty   a fair sized portion  Good value   for    It was enjoyable   I d go back  Just a couple of things letting the place down   smelly toilets  wrong order  s   l   o   w staff  
neutral;Food was OK  but wouldn t bring me to visit again  Staff were very casually dressed and the place didn t have a professional feel to it 
neutral; been here a few times now its unfortunate that the service is so poor as the food is good   god help you if you go when its half full never mind full  think we waited  minutes for our meal to turn up   got a free coke   think me and my partner have decided to call it a day and not go back now     
neutral; Came here for lunch on Friday  shown to a table by a friendly water  but should ve realised then it wasn t a good idea  as we saw lots of people sitting at tables looking around expectantly waiting for their food  After you decide what you want  you have to join the long queue at the counter to place your order and ask for your drinks  We were met with a very stony face from the dark haired waitress at the till  who even when we said hello to her  ignored us and just sighed and looked straight ahead  as we were holding her up by being pleasant  We were given our coffees and went back to the table to wait for our paninis  However  the food took so long to arrive  we had drunk our coffees before we got our food  we couldn t wait as they would ve got cold  We couldn t even go up and get another coffee  as we would have had to join the huge queue again and then our food would ve got cold  
neutral; Had a lunch here one saturday whilst shopping with my  grandchildren age  The food was good quality  well cooked  but some dishes were a bit cold  if the food has just been put out it was fine  The service was speedy  but we felt a bit rushed as the table slot is for  hours only  Ok for most but kids were keen to try different dishes so we ran out of time  Value for money os good  but drinks push the bill up  
neutral; A really excellent Sunday lunch for the two of us  We hadn t been before and despite our internet booking being lost the menu choice and dining experience was excellent  The service was really good and attentive  
neutral; As big fans of Thai cuisine we were keen to try this new restaurant just down the road from where we live   The night started well  we were impressed with the menu and we chose Starter Platter B which was HUGE  Really good value for money and a nice selection which we really enjoyed  Unfortunately there was some confusion with our main and when it arrived they gave me a chicken dish when I had ordered beef  They were very quick to attempt to rectify their mistake but I m still not convinced the dish they gave me was the main I had chosen  I didn t particularly enjoy my main  it tasted strangely cheesy and to be honest I was stuffed from the platter  Throughout the main I noticed that literally every other table in the restaurant had some kind of issue with their order  I heard people complain that they had not received some dishes  while others were being given things they hadn t asked for and there seemed to be general disarray  This was also reflected in the take away   two people came to collect take away while we were there and they both came back later to complain that something was missing  or something wasn t right   Perhaps they are still trying to get their bearings with the new business but I wasn t impressed with the service at all  I could see that the food had potential and I was perhaps just unlucky with the main but I wouldn t recommend this restaurant and I don t think I will go back  
neutral; Food was nice  relatively cheap for the standard  but the busy  loud atmosphere was just unpleasant to eat in  and the waitresses seemed to just throw your food down in front of you and leave  
neutral; It was good to find a lot of useful stock  in addition to smoked items  on sale as Craster is without a full sized shop  However we were disappointed not to see inside the smokery  H S strikes again  perhaps  
neutral;We popped into the Furze bush today for lunch the atmosphere was very inviting along with the very helpful staff behind the bar   We ordered our drinks while we perused the menu  I chose the Ploughman s and when it arrived I was disappointed as there seemed to be hardly any Stilton cheese  just a thin slither   However my mum had the cheese and tomato Ciabatta and there was ample cheese and tomato and she really enjoyed it   For the price nearly    the ploughman s needs more cheese  
neutral; Had not visited the lee garden for some time  usually it has been in a group of  or more  This time just  of us  We were put next to a door going upstairs and where everybody had to pass us  Waiting staff were ok but not exactly friendly  Portion sizes were ok  food nice but we felt a little expensive  
neutral; Visited the Spaniard on Saturday lunchtime  really pretty we chose the location so we could take the dog  place was really busy and had a good atmosphere went to the bar to get drinks and a menu asked to open a tab but that was not allowed  asked when we had our meal could we order more drinks but that was not allowed either you had to go back in to order more drinks  Staff at the bar very chaotic and had a problem understanding us  Food came quite quickly had scallops but the pancetta was so salty it overpowered the scallops  Next I had a rib eye steak good job we brought the dog was really fatty and chewy the bits you could eat had a nice flavour  Our waitress was pleasant but could not understand us  we were never asked if meal was ok  They take away menus when you order  but when clearing the table no one returns I didn t see any one eat dessert and I think that s why  To be honest their sales would rocket if they served drinks while people were eating and they would sell desserts  I would not have minded if they had retained my card until the end paying up front and with no tab makes me think of mass catering in a chain where I would never go  Would like to return in the dark to see all the lights in the trees lit up There is also a crow who swoops down  
neutral; Booked as a treat for my parents and was really looking forward to the evening   Upon arrival there was no acknowledgment from any of the members of staff so we walked into the bar area  I explained we had a reservation and could we order a pre dinner drink  After about  minutes the bar man came over and halfway through my order he just walked off to serve someone else  Very strange  He came back about  minutes later to take orders for drinks  which took  minutes to arrive  and said he couldn t give us a menu to look at as there were specials on a board   When we went through to the dining room the atmosphere was better but service seemed very hectic and so many staff rushing around whilst seemingly achieving very little  In the middle of our dinner order the waiter was tapped on the shoulder and left with no apology excuse me  Someone else came about  minutes later  When asked  he said that man had to serve the food and so had to leave but he apologised and finished the order   The food was nice  although the order was a little muddled  presumably from confusion caused by the overlap in waiters  and the pre starters were a great idea  However we were charged p for an extra bread roll which smacks of pettiness to me when your spending  + and is a pet hate of mine    I understand what Stovell s are trying to achieve but unfortunately the staff are evidently not highly trained  fine dining is not the same when the waitress leans over your husbands food to give you yours on every course rather than walk around  and there seemed to be very little cohesion between them  Sadly  the great food was severely let down by the poor  hectic service  There is just no excuse for walking away from a table  twice  whilst in mid sentence  I was rather upset by the service and would only recommend the food  
neutral; We had read some mixed reviews on this local cafe bar but decided to try it out and make up our own minds on it    we went for lunch and it was    OK  Not great but OK  Food was average and it was a bit pricy  The staff were OK but the music was just a bit too loud to enjoy conversation  There was just something about it that didn t feel great  Can t easily put it into words  but it was lacking warmth  That said  we will go again to see if it s better in the evening  
neutral;A friend and I came here for lunch on Friday  having been so impressed with the one in Soho I thought this one would be just as good    First of let me say how helpful and attentive the staff really were  especially considering how busy the restaurant is  We had to wait half an hour for a table  which we expected as it was Lunch time in London at a popular restaurant  but we didn t mind  we went off for a drink and they called us on the phone when a table was ready  The service throughout was exceptionally speedy and they were very helpful    However this particular Burger and Lobster is very small in comparison to the one I had previously been to and everything in general just felt a bit cramped  The tables are very small in relations to how big the plates are  you are exceptionally close to the other tables and just generally feel like you don t have much room for anything  Plus you can hear everyone else s conversations word for word    I am also assuming it is because of the small size of the restaurant which is why it really does smell quite pungently of fish  Now I know the sell lobster hence the fishy smell  but this really was overwhelming  something that I have never experienced in any other fish restaurant or in fact in the other Burger and Lobster  The food as well was a bit underwhelming  over cooked lobster    I would definitely recommend this restaurant as a brand but I would make a conscious effort to only eat at the one in Soho 
neutral; I had been meaning to try this restaurant for a while as it has only been open for a short while here in Basildon  My mum  my  year old son and myself decided to dine here at lunchtime on a Saturday  On arrival  we were shown to a nice table to browse the drinks and food menu  There were a few people in the restaurant so considering it wasn t overly busy  the service was generally slow  Our food  when it arrived  was nice enough  my son and myself had a pizza which was tasty and how you would expect a pizza to be but the side order of chips were luke warm at best on arrival   not the end of the world but I expected them to be hotter  My mum had the spaghetti bolognese which she said was ok but not as nice as  the other  Italian in the vacinity  Overall the food was o k  and suitable for a quick  local bite but I would certainly think twice about coming here if I was looking for something a bit special  
neutral;The staff were very attentive  the food was OK  not the worst we have eaten but also not the best or at all memorable  I felt the place itself really lacked any atmosphere 
neutral; Ate here for dinner as we were waiting to go out  food was good quality for mcdonalds  It was hot and as expected  
neutral; i dont understand why people pay so much to eat here its nothing special and have you seen the chef  
neutral; I thought there could have been more selection for the starters I am vegetarian but eat fish  there was nothing I liked as a starter which is very unusual 
neutral;We  party of   visited the Green Man Inn late in the evening  on the way home from a busy day  A well presented  bistro pub  Quiet and clean  We arrived at  pm and were greeted at the bar upon arrival and drinks were served  However  the    members of staff behind the bar then stood discussing the local road closures  whilst ignoring another gentleman who d walked in  Rude  but it was later in the evening  perhaps they d had a busy day  We were told a table would be prepared for us and we happily stood chatting at the bar   minutes later we were informed the table would take a while  so asked if we would like to take a seat at the bar  A Further  minutes later  a pleasant waitress took our order  once again telling us the table was just taking longer than expected  Now  by this point I m looking forward to the food  as they re clearly still very busy at this time of night  this must be a good sign  right  WRONG   We were finally  after  minutes  taken through to the almost empty dining area  There were two other tables of people eating  There were tables half made up and table with plates of half finished food left on them   So what had they been busy with   I asked the Mr   We both ordered the same options  from the  course for   menu  We had the pate to start with  Lovely  no complaints whatsoever  After this came the  Gourmet burger   Now  personally putting bacon and a fried egg on a burger does not a gourmet burger make  it was edible  however nothing to write home about  We opted for sweet potato fries  well cooked and enjoyable  Disappointingly though the home made onion rings were under cooked  For desert we had the creme brulee  which for me was bittersweet  It arrived in a lovely tea cup  with a strawberry on top and short bread biscuits  although  they were on the small side  first impressions were good  then we realize  it s cold  I ve always had it warm  after the sugar has been lightly toasted  however this had clearly been prepared hours before and put in the fridge  Laziness  especially as it wasn t busy  It s my favorite pudding  and I have never been served it cold before   Overall the food was to be expected  with the exception of the pudding  However the fact that everything took so long  and there seemed like a lot of staff standing doing nothing we were disappointed    One of the party is unwell today  Hopefully an unfortunate coincidence   
neutral; I visited this place on the Aug Bank holiday weekend  having found it based on Tripadvisor reviews  I wanted a great place to take my parents whilst they were visiting   booked a table for :    We arrived only to have to wait for a table  despite offering us a table in a quieter area of the restaurant which we were happy to accept the manager then decided to make us wait a further  mins for a table which lead us to believe that there were no tables available after all   our booking probably wasn t even valid    The food was great when it arrived  but the service was slow   often extra drinks ordered came after we d finished our courses which was a great shame  It took a great effort to get waiters attention despite the fact they were walking around clearing empty tables rather than serving existing ones    I struggle to understand all the raving reviews as we spent a couple of hundred pounds here and for that price I would expect a lot more  
neutral; The food was really good  and the chance to sit and look out over the beautiful surroundings was particularly valued  I agree with other reviewers that the service left something to be desired  We were left waiting for a long time between appetisers and the main  and when I went to ask politely about the main  I was made to feel belittled and an inconvenience  Though the food was then brought out promptly  the service was insincere and indifferent  
neutral; The restaurant is obviously new as the staff lack confidence   We sat upstairs and despite it being cold outside  we were too hot  The staff had been made aware of this but could not open any windows  so hope this gets fixed  We have a mixed review for our meals as the salmon main was very good but a medium fillet steak ordered was simply too chewey  
neutral;I recently went to the Greenberry Cafe with friends for brunch one weekend  The restaurant and food were great but we were really disappointed with the attitude of the manager on duty  We had pre booked our table and had to wait for  minutes by the door until the exact minute before we sat down  despite the fact that there was more than one free table   Then when we had sat the manager promptly told us we had  hour max before having to leave  Jack was our waiter and he was lovely  as was our food   we decided not to leave the discretionary  % tip  but this was not because of Jack it was a direct reflection of the management  Jack should be the new manager 
neutral;We all know the food is good  and always consistent  Call me boring though but there must have been  birthdays whilst we were there and it gets a bit much after the first couple  Wont be going back which is a pity  the staff are nice too 
neutral;Lovely food  The place could do with some money spending on the seating area  It s quite expensive so needs to reflect that Awful coffee  The milk is always over boiled and burnt  YAK
neutral; Popped in for a coffee and scone   Scones and coffee were very nice but a bit surprised that they don t have a customer toilet or hand washing facilities  
neutral; Overpriced  mediocre food  Brettingtons offers a lowest common denominator starter menu  such as chicken wings and potato skins  the kind of offering one might expect to find at a Harvester or Frankie and Bennys  The execution of the starters was sufficient  but unremarkable  entirely undeserving of the higher than average price tag   I had the lobster thermidor for my main course  It was poor  I can only assume neither owner nor chef has ever had a thermidor   because this was not one  It was just a baked lobster  Lack of discernible thermidor iness not withstanding  it was still not a great dish  The lobster was overcooked  chewy and tough  The accompanying chips were sub par  A bit on the soggy side  Again  Harvester chips  not  I ve paid   for this course chips    The service was    Weird  Friendly and attentive but simultaneously poor  with long wait times and cold food    Overall  it was a disappointing experience  The restaurant might just be able to survive in the context of existing in an area where the average diner won t have the most discerning palate  On the other hand  a pricey menu and amateurish execution might bring the place down  For anyone fancying a spot of lobster I would recommend hopping on the train up to Lomdon and heading to a Lobster and Burger  It will cost you less    for a lobster  and the quality is hugely superior  
neutral; Opted for scallops of the a la carte and tempura prawns  followed by cod chips and mushy peas from the lunchtime menu  Was served by a friendly waitress    However no one in the restaurant other than me and my partner  Starter came  just the right amount for starters  The scallops were cooked to perfection   However the tempura prawns were bland and rubbery inside    Disappointed fish and chips were ok but nothing to write home about  and although it was just the two of us in the restaurant you would think the food would have been piping hot    It wasn t  All in all  a bit disappointing   
neutral;This restaurant has a fantastic position right on Bournemouth beach  It serves a lot of fish dishes  They were all very good but perhaps just lacked that wow factor I expected from the restuarants reputation  Service was very slow 
neutral; edible but nothing exciting and at times the chicken has felt and tatsed like reconstituted rubbish 
neutral; The staff was very friendly and welcoming  the restaurant is very nicely decorated and reminds you of Cuba  However  the food took way too long  was cold and over priced  I also missed typical Cuban dishes  such as ropa vieja  We still had a very nice evening and I would recommend this place rather for a drink  Cuban Mojito  to enjoy the atmosphere than for dinner    
neutral; We are regular visitors to Saathi and we re really disappointed by our most recent visit  The food was average at best and the wait was terrible  We booked a table for   and had to chase our main course just after   Yes they were busy and take away orders were coming in all the time but the staff seemed to forget about the customers in the restaurant  One of the dishes was obviously microwaved   When the staff asked if we enjoyed the food we said not as much as usual and the response was well we are busy    not really good enough   If you go ask for a table at the front the back is dingy and very squashed   Not sure when or if we will go back  
neutral; thought i would treat myself to lunch here today  had to wait a good  minutes to be even be asked what i wanted i know there was a lot of customers but there was one waitress  had a bun in her hair who seemed to think talking to people she knew more important as for food i had the breakfast it was ok but the fried egg was still raw around the yolk  no one bother to do a checkback to see if everything was ok  
neutral;I have visited this cafe as always serves good coffee  upon trying one of the scones on display which look appealing was extremely disappointed by the first taste and the fact it was not cooked properly   I have tried several times as thought might be a one off   but unfortunately it s not the case it does however depend on who seems to be in the kitchen   am of the opinion that maybe the wrong person is in there too often  Such a shame really  haven t been in for a while but don t intend on wasting any more of my hard earned money 
neutral; Has just what you expect from any pub  any where  at any time  Piled high  moved out rapidly  Filled a hole  Young staff  Exceptionally busy  Almost stressful  Several  sittings   Carvery  Won t be returning  
neutral; Went here a few months ago with my other half  It was on a Monday  however  it was still packed as they had a % off deal  We got here quite late but still left ourselves plenty of time to have two or three courses before they closed  The food was absolutely spot on for me  couldn t fault it  especially for the price we ended up paying  The service however  was lacking  Someone came to take our order pretty much straight away  but after that there was nothing  No checkback on our food  not even after clearing plates  Wanted another drink but couldn t get the attention of anyone  By the time we d finished it was nearing closing time  We were ready for the bill but all the staff were just stood around paying no attention to anyone   I m pretty disappointed really as it s put me off returning since  even though the food was gorgeous  
neutral;Have visited this cafe a few times recently and have come to the conclusion that the service you receive here varies too much   On occasions have been very pleased with the standard of food and drinks and at other times very disappointed  For example when buying coffee  it has ranged from so strong its impossible to drink to just about able to taste coffee in it  Also the temperature of coffee varies from hot to just warm I witnessed an embarrassing moment only last week when an elderly Scottish man visited the cafe asking if they had any pies  Both young people who were serving in the cafe did not understand what the man was saying because of his strong accent and just kept saying  quot What  quot   The man got annoyed and left without ordering anything  Not the first time this sort of thing has gone on there   This cafe needs to raise its standards as they are just one of many cafes in the town 
neutral; Yesterday was our first visit to this restaurant although we have passed it loads of times  Saturday lunchtime is probably not the best time as we were given a waiting period of about  minutes  Actually it was less than that  The ambiance is typically  quot modern chain quot  with a couple of nice touches  But by the time we left the place was COLD  Not many options for a vegetarian and one of those was finished  However the roast vegetable jalfrezi was pretty good although it could have done with a bit more rice  My husband s cod and chips were just okay   he said the cod was not the best quality  On the other hand the final bill at around   was very reasonable considering we had two main dishes and two puddings  Oh   and a large glass of wine and a soft drink  The service was good and our waitress was helpful and nice  
neutral;Went to the harvester today  Can t fault the food  I ve never really found fault with their food  But the service was shocking  We ordered our meals and drinks at the same time  our drinks were bought over later than the meal  We got the refill drinks and was asked if we knew where to get the from  but when we got there it was out of order and was a sign asking you to go to the bar  Would of been nice to of been informed of that  Waitress did not come back at any point to check our meal was ok  had to ask someone else for table to be cleared and ask someone else for the bill  As I said  food was lovely  but staff could make you feel abit more welcome  then you feel more inclined to leave a tip 
neutral; This fish and chip shop is perfectly located in the market square  Our children were able to watch a busker perform tricks while their dad queued for over half an hour to get fish and chips  We d been walking all day and were very hungry for this meal   It was ok  but not the best fish and chips I ve had by any stretch  The batter was nice and light and crispy  but just too greasy for our taste  and the chips were average too  Made palatable with curry sauce  
neutral; We have dinner here from time to time and are always singing its praises  However we arrived last night just before pm to find that every single table in the pub was reserved  This is public house not a restaurant so you expect to take a chance if its busy but not to walk in and find empty tables waiting for people who had reserved them  This experience will make us think twice before going again  
neutral; They do a pre theatre menu which is fine  I chose a small pizza and salad  Always welcoming and served in plenty of time for the show  
neutral; My friend and I came here for a late evening meal   the staff were friendly and warm  there was not a lot of people around and the place was quiet  The menu offered some good choices of vegetarian and meat dishes  I had a derek pi t which was a cubed lamb and peppers dish  The meal overall was pleasant and we had a good time  With drinks the meal came to pounds in total  pretty decent for the area  
neutral; If you like beefburger and chips then this is the place for you  A couple of salads with soft boiled eggs  Had fish cake and chips  which my friend and I shared a fish cake between us as they had run out  The chips were skinny chips  plenty of them but cold  The only thing was we both enjoyed the wine  it was excellent  So for drinks I would recommend  but I will not go there again as nothing on the menu to tempt me  
neutral;The Sunday roast my aunt ordered was roast pork with apple sauce and crackling  she got roast pork with cranberry sauce and yorkshire pudding  we complained and apple sauce was brought 
neutral; The staff are welcoming  attentive and friendly  The food is always lovely  a little bit pricey I think  unless you get one of their evening meal deals  Also  the portions could be bigger  It s based in a hotel  so the restaurant is always full of contractors drinking their day away  a little off putting  In conclusion  it s a good little restaurant for a family Sunday roast  
neutral; Popped in for lunch and was welcomed by a really nice friendly waitress then it went a bit down hill no beer  no certain white wine  no red wine  no steak  no lots of things Its been hot  ye we know  Anyway we eventually managed to order something they had  Was acceptable but wont visit again  
neutral; I have now visited Wantage s edition of Wildwood on nearly a dozen occasions  Both for lunch and dinner and although the food is consistent and normally good the service  out of  times is just too terribly slow  Genuinely sometimes waiting min just to place a drink order  etc  Always seems a bit understaffed  such a shame  
neutral; As always the food was delish  I fully recommend the kimchi  I always get   I wish it was a bit bigger portion   The service was a bit forgetful and slow at points  I had to ask for the bill three times and when it came he handed it to me along with the card machine  not giving me any time to check the bill   Will still be returning as the service can be hit and miss and they re generally nice  
neutral; Came here on a Friday evening  very busy  was told a  minute wait for a table but managed to get one within about  minutes which was a bonus  All staff were very friendly and welcoming  There was a very broad range on the menu which was very impressive  Ordered both starters and mains  starters were very nice  but mains were not the best  Steak and Ale pie was not very nice  tasteless and chips were soggy  Other meals were average  wouldn t rush back in the future  
neutral; been waiting to eat at the ambrette for ages so was quite excited when i heard it was coming to canterbury  unfortunately unless my expectations are unreasonably high  it never really lived up to what i had imagined  the crab was exceptional but everything else only so so including the service if you could call it that   i really hope this was a one off and will definately be going back to find out as canterbury really needs restaurants of this quality  
neutral; Went this morning to this restaurant for breakfast got there about  and the buffet continental breakfast was available   The pancakes were cold and I asked a member of staff to microwave  No honey no muffins maple syrup turned out to be golden syrup maple flavour   Cooked breakfasts were good value bur sausages inedible they had been microwaved then put under a grill one side only very off putting white sausages thin brown stripe  My son asked for a medium steak on the side of the breakfast it was bloody on the inside and burned to a cinder on the outside   This was also left  We have ate here before and it was good and great value   Today poorly stocked and a lazy chef   Won t be going again soon 
neutral; Food was good but it was quite expensive for what we had  Waitress was very friendly and cheerful even tho it was very busy  
neutral; Atmosphere was lovely for a pre theatre dinner  Food was very good  But portions were small considering the price paid   Mohitos were excellent   best I have ever tasted  Expect to pay around   for  with drinks   
neutral; Firstly I would like to say the welcome by a blonde haired waitress was great and we were lucky to be able to be seated right away   We ordered our drinks which came promptly and then ordered our food which came exceptionally quickly  a bit too quick   I had the rebel burger which to be honest was nice but the chips were definitely not hot or freshly cooked  my daughter had a chicken hogie in a sub roll which wasn t particularly fresh the filling however was nice  The dark haired waitress who served us wasn t unpleasant but not particularly friendly either and I didn t get the impression she was happy to be at work  I didn t see her smile once  I had to ask for another drink  no up selling  and again this did come promptly  I have never felt the need to write a review but we opted to come to this restaurant rather than our normal one to try it as I d heard some great reviews but I was dissappointed  The restaurant itself is full of fantastic paraphernalia and looks great maybe we went on a off day but couldn t recommend it from our experience  The one other thing be careful when ordering a side of onion rings ask to try one first as I nearly spat mine out it tasted mouldy yuk  probably just the seasoning  
neutral; Visited recently with a friend for lunch  Food was okay and nicely presented and not overprieced but the beer was not presented properly at the right temperature  Shame as it was a guest ale too  
neutral; I have visited this restaurant on several occasions but sadly the last two have been very disappointing  has there been a change of kitchen staff   On my last visit at the end of August my partner had a passable sea bass dish while I chose the pulled pork apple sauce and stuffing bap   The bap was soggy  the pork hard and dry  the apple sauce was no more than large chunks of uncooked apple and the stuffing a hard dry ball  Things would have to improve for me to venture there again  it s very disappointing having had such good food there in the past 
neutral; We booked in for a table of   the staff were amazing and the food was good unfortunately the wait was terrible we got there at : and waited over an hour for two staters and then another hour for the mains by the Time they arrived at : two of the children were to tired to eat  The drinks were amazing it was just a Shame about the wait  
neutral; I used to be a regular at the old venue  This is only the second time at the new place  which I find cramped with tables too close together for any private conversation  I saw others getting their meals and felt optimistic  I chose chicken   chorizo pasta from the special board  I came in a small round dish which was half full  I queried with the waitress who checked and said it was a standard portion  I queried later with a waiter who said all ingredient were weighed out  I was offered something else later if I was still hungry   I proceeded to chop the pasta in half to make it look more  No one came back to ask how it was  there was no acknowledgement when the bill arrived and I certainly won t go back  
neutral; I have moved into this  quot village quot  and decided to have Sunday lunch here with my twin sister   I ordered a traditional turkey Sunday lunch  I was disappointed to see it arrive swimming in watery gravy Sadly the vegetables were cold too   In all fairness when I complained they exchanged my meal for a very very hot one   The turkey tasted processed and sliced like it  My sister ordered a second drink  sadly she had to go to the bar  minutes later and pick it up off the counter as the waitress forgot to take it to us I have been before and found it  quot ok quot   Would I reccommend this pub For a drink and dessert maybe   
neutral; lovely coffee but a bit of an old man s pub feel  Needs to be modernised to attract more visitors  Then again  it wasn t a big chain  Friendly staff  
neutral; We went to Basil for tea and cake today but got pulled in by the quiche  As there are no menus on the table we asked our waitress how much the slices of quiche were  to which she told us   Whilst the quiche was lovely we had a bit of a shock when the bill came and they were actually priced at Just would have been nice to be given the correct information from the beginning  
neutral; Went here last night on a whim  The starters were great  I ordered a Balti chicken jalfrezi  it just didn t taste right  the chicken had been pre cooked which I think is a really lazy way of cooking  My partner had a korma and that was the same   disappointing  
neutral; Overall we had a great night and the food is superb with quality ingredients  Sadly I can only score a  because of the total confusion with the Christmas menu which I still don t understand and I overheard the waiter on the next table explaining it to someone else  The most annoying staff that hoover around you constantly with the doormen not far behind  the doormen surely should be outside or in the foyer area and it made all of us feel very very uncomfortable  
neutral; Not tried this place before but it always looked popular  Whilst our doner kebab and chicken kebab were tasty  you paid a lot of money for small portions  Had we had salad with our kebabs we would have had even less meat  if that were possible  Service was friendly but unfortunately that s not enough for us to come back  
neutral; We went to this restaurant a week ago as a birthday celebration  My son had picked it because of the exotic meats it offered  which he loves  When we were handed the menus   all the exotic meats were unavailable  which pretty much spoilt it for him  The food we had was nice  however the atmosphere let it down  Bright lights  like sitting in a cafe   hard chairs and we were sat next to the delivery lady all evening  who was chatting on her phone and had two children with her  one in pyjamas  so it was like sitting in an office  She even had me move a bit so she could plug her phone in behind me  Not sure I would go again  shame as the food  as I said  was nice  
neutral;I was really excited to go here I am a huge Sherlock fan and although its only a pub named after the great character it was just across from our hotel and I though it was worth a go    You can book on line so I did and have to say you def should esp if more than  people as it was quite busy even at  o clock on a Friday  However  when I arrived although I had an email confirmation they had lost my booking but they were nice enough to still find room for us    The restaurant is upstairs so although downstairs even the street outside looks super busy just head upstairs and you should be fine if looking for food    The staff weren t very attentive and it was very hard to get their attention which was quite bad as we were sitting only  metres from them but they seemed absorbed in talking with each other  When we got the food it was nice but nothing amazing  I got the pulled pork burger and my partner got a roast dinner and we split some onion rings  Unfortunately my burger came with a sauce I had requested it without  Once found though I can only say the staff were very helpful in relation to this as they got a change straight away    The decoration was amazing and the atmosphere was quite romantic as the music was very jazzy  I have to say the service and food could be improved although I suppose it was worth a look but def more a tourist trip than anything 
neutral; This used to be a regular choice for me and whoever I went with  but the last three times Ive been it just keeps getting worse and worse  I usually got for an ultimate plate but the last three times  the chicken wings have been bone dry and I actually sent them back  which i never normally do   which to be fair to the waiter he made no fuss about  The general standard seems to be getting worse    
neutral; Visited Umami in mid June  The food was very good but the service was very slow  I arrived at the table before my partner and was ignored  Even when he arrived we had to ask for the menus  Eventually we ordered food and when it arrived it was extremely good  After we had finished the main course we were ignored again  although staff seemed to be wandering around aimlessly  and not offered anything else  Eventually we asked for the bill and left  I did comment on the poor service as we left  What a pity as it has great potential but certainly needs to up its game  
neutral; I wanted to really like this place but it really didn t tick many boxes  We went there as there was a wait at Caravan next door   When we got there it was the start of brunch and despite it being half empty and not filling up during our time there we were sat on the strange naughty children tables near the door  We ordered anyway and despite the brunch menu not being very brunchy we each found something   At some point as we waited for our food and as we were googling the salt and pepper grinders  probably the most interesting thing about our visit  we wanted to find where to buy them from  a waitress came over and took them away  only from our table and in spite of the fact we had ordered food  I think she decided were the sort of people that steal them  We re not   The food came and my popcorn grits were bland until I added a lot of pepper  taken from another table as ours had been taken from us before it arrived  and my boyfriend was thoroughly disappointed with his beans until he added salt   We left feeling thoroughly unfulfilled  If you find yourself in this area and hungry  do yourself a favour and wait for a table at Caravan  
neutral; This is a city pub in a village location  Had a lovely lunch here though  It is good for children and the garden space is nice for a drink in the warmer weather  But overall pretty average  
neutral; I went after a tiring field trip  As a student  I found this quite expensive  As a vegetarian  I found my food choices were seriously limited  The food was tasty  and it didn t take too long to come  
neutral; This restaurant is good for your average family meal  Nothing special but nice food  Service can sometimes be a little bit iffy  
neutral; I normally quite enjoy the food at the James Figg however going there a week ago  i was left bitterly disappointed   I ordered a JFC or something  which was fried chicken  potato wedges and corn on the cob   It was horrible    The fried chicken was tasteless and the corn on the cob was so cold  I had to ask for it to be taken back  The only nice bit of my meal were the potato wedges which were very nice    Their only saving grace was the fact that their staff were very attentive and very very polite  We had one young girl serving us  me and my mother  who was particularly friendly and apologised on behalf of the James Figgs for a disappointing meal    However  that has been my only bad experience at the Figgs so I shall hope to come back again and see some improvement on the food  
neutral; Went with a group of friends from work as we have visited previously  We preordered our meal before hand  After waiting to be seated for around  minutes we then were taken to a crammed table and bearly had a chance to sit down before the starters were served  Main course was then served just as quickly and vegetables and garlic breads were missing had to ask the waiter twice for these   Food was very nice and was hot but the during the whole service I felt like we were getting rushed to leave as if it was a fast food restaurant  
neutral;I ordered the sea bass which i d never had before and was tasty  but it was so full of bones it became a slightly frustrating eating experience  The side dishes served with it were nice  though I would have been a bit disappointed had I been vegetarian to find bacon bits in my vegetable side dish    My boyfriend had the duck and said it was nice but a bit cold  I d have appreciated a vegetarian optional I often eat veggie and there was nothing on the menu at all that seemed veggie friendly  There was one chicken dish  a duck dish and the rest was all red meat or sea food which was a little limiting for me as I don t eat red meat at all   The dessert  a bake well tart style frangipani with apricots was excellent  and I would recommend it highly   I liked the atmosphere and the staff were pleasant but unobtrusive  which is what I look for from my waiter or waitress  it s a pet hate when you get asked every five minutes how your food is  because I just want to be left to eat it 
neutral; This was our first time dining at the Garden Of India  We had been told by a number of friends that it was a fantastic place to eat at and decided to try it out  We were extremely dissappointed by the service that we recieved whilst we were there as the staff were very abrupt and quite rude  Whilst we were paying  we had the bill plate snatched from us and were not even acknowledged when we left  We had popadoms too start with the pickle tray and was very shocked to find a hair lurking underneath the Mango Chutney  This was  as you can imagine a very big turn off  Despite this  the main course was brilliant and was full of flavour  although they use boil in the bag rice  The food here was very reasonably priced and was relatively good value for money  I would consider reccommending this restaurant to friends or family and would probably return their ourseleves  but the customer service they deliver needs improving  
neutral; I booked the restaurant for pm  but we arrived a little early in order to have drinks before dinner  The receptionist was on the phone and made no attempt to acknowledge us waiting next to her  We sat down at a sofa waiting for her to finish her call and we were ceremoniously ignored so I decided it was necessary to walk up to the bar and order the wine  The bar staff were just chatting between the two of them  It seemed to me that there was no  direction    the staff weren t unpleasant  they just didn t seem on the ball  At  pm we were still sitting on the sofa without any communication with any staff  so eventually I had to ask for service  The receptionist asked what we would like   in return  I suggested that food might not be a bad idea   We ordered our food    of us ordered goats cheese salad to start  Unbelievably  there was probably only  grams of goats cheese on either plate  We politely asked if they could find the goats cheese in these salads at which point they agreed it was difficult to spot    They took the plates and returned with a newly replenished goats cheese salad  but only for  person  Shambolic  The steak was truly excellent and cooked to perfection  All in all  the food was  hit and miss   but the service was unmistakenly under par  There didn t seem to be anyone at the helm   getting served was like herding cats  The restaurant  supervisor   was a jolly and personable woman  but she spent her whole time saying sorry  Mmmmnnnnn  not good  
neutral; I came here for lunch with some work colleagues and we all ordered off the express menu which seemed like a good deal   courses for    I had the olive and anchovy tart to start which was ok  but the half a chicken with fries which I had for my main was really disappointing  The chicken was extremely dry and overcooked  it also didn t come with any kind of sauce or salad so all in all it was a very plain dry meal  
neutral; This is your typical costa coffee house as far as the eats and drinks are concerned  but be aware that you need to keep hold of your receipt as if you wish to visit the toilets you will need a code that is printed on it   You are not told when you purchase your eats or drinks that you will need your receipt if you wish to use the facilities  It is also not the easiest of toilets to get into  
neutral; I went because I needed something to eat before a trip to the Hippodrome and the pre theatre menus in the other restaurants did not appeal  It was a Saturday afternoon so the restaurant was not busy  the staff were friendly and the food came fairly quickly  I had something from the lunch time menu which was better value  Food was okay   not the worst I have eaten  chicken and chips  and was not too expensive with a glass of wine   The dÇ¸cor was a bit tired and the toilets could do with updating  
neutral; Everyone has talked about this place and said is a must if you do go to Oxford and want somewhere to hang out and have some food   I can not comment on the food as I did not have any   The decor yeah  boho  cool etc   etc   but when I went it was freezing maybe they should invest in some heaters  The beer was expensive and i will refrain from being rude about its taste but I had half lets just say  to cleanse my mouth I got up to their counter to see what nibbles they had   Very cute cakes were on display all very expensive for what they were    The owner seemed pleasant which is a plus  but the layout is not practical  the problem with these places is yeah it looks cool if you want to take a picture and post it on instagram #oxford #beercostmemymonthlypay but thats about it    have to try the food yet though 
neutral; I enjoy visiting the rayleigh harvester  staff seem friendly  wish they d smile a bit more though  nice food  i do recommend to friends when they re out in rayeligh  
neutral; Came here after seeing the great reviews and recommendations  The coffee   hot was and others looked really good  However  we ordered a panini and toastie and soup  We waited a long time and eventually my panini arrived to be told that the panini grill had broken  I was presented with a panini will all the filling hanging out of the side and slopped onto a plate  The panini filling was boiling and I had to then try put it into the bread to eat it  I think if you re coming here for drinks   cake it is brillaint but the food isn t brilliant  the toastie and the soup were about average too    
neutral; Expensive if you have to pay for the Car Park too  Idyllic setting  but resented having to pay for the car park  to have a coffee  Limited choice of cakes and seating    
neutral; Arranged to meet up with family on Sunday th September because it s a convenient place for us to meet   they have always done great breakfasts  Firstly we wanted  quot a cuppa quot    had to order at the till   pay for it there  not unreasonable really but when we were given the menus it transpired that if we had the  quot full English quot  tea   coffee were included in the price bit annoying but it was sorted out fairly satisfactorily  Then on perusing the breakfast menu what had always been my treat I e  Smoked salmon on muffins with poached eggs   Hollandaise sauce was no longer available   So I Ordered scrambled eggs on toast with bacon  The scrambled eggs were dry not light   fluffy   the bacon had definitely been kept warm for too long as it was overlooked dry   very chewy  The venue is still a nice place to visit but I for one will not be having breakfast there again  
neutral; First I must say that the ambience of this restaurant was very good  went with several lady friends and found staff very helpful and we were pleased to find a lunchtime place where we could remain and talk without being hurried  However the chips which accompanied the meals were soggy  greasy and the majority of them were left as it was as if they had been cooked sometime previously and just heated up  Also noted that fish and chips mentioned on the menu as with mushy peas were served with garden peas  Such a good location in Tynemouth with parking facilities but consistent good food should be a priority  So many other establishments to eat at  
neutral;The food was delicious as always  The staff were very lacklustre though  Weren t particularly inviting  and when we left the two colleagues by the door didn t even look up to acknowledge us  Luckily the rest you serve yourself  sauces drinks cutlery etc  so didn t have worry about  bothering  someone else
neutral; Been a lot of times as I live just down the road   They do a lovely English breakfast and nice pot of English tea   It s ok inside quite big   Outside is ok in summer but not the best place to sit as is on a main road north end road   Reasonable price really   Great if your looking for breakfast and waiters and waitresses normally polite and kind   
neutral; I went out to eat here last night with my boyfriend his parents   my  year old daughter  I thought the food was good   the service was ok as they were attentive to my daughter  She went to the toilet a few times during the evening   the ladies toilets were in the worst state I have seen anywhere in Bristol for a long time  There was only one of the toilet which was just barely passable for any of us to use   the rest were pretty disgusting   I was really surprised that a restaurant like this cannot keep standards a bit better   Please do something abot this as it really lets you down  
neutral; Good atmosphere   food and wine  Front of house staff could be more friendly as the waiters are very good so only thing the lowered my review  
neutral; We haven t been here for a while and we re looking forward to our meal  We enjoyed it  but not as good as previous ones  The squid was a little overdone so on the chewy side  The starters were OK as was the valcano chicken  The restaurant was quiet so dissapionted the quality wasn t as good as it has been  Having said that I m sure we will return in the future  
neutral;We were a party of nine and had booked a few days before  When we arrived we decided to sit outside and ordered gin and tonics   the very polite young man said he was terribly sorry but they had run out of tonic  There was a supermarket opposite   what was wrong with them popping out to get some  That is what service is all about  Having said that  the meal was good  though not the best we had during our stay in Bourton 
neutral;Nice buzzy atmosphere and obviously very popular with locals but food is really not up to scratch  The menu promised great things but in reality the portions were tiny  and expensive for what they were  and disappointingly bland  Even the bread wasn t authentic Turkish and the coffee tasted watered down  Perhaps a trip to the delights of North London s Turkish restaurant community will put punters straight 
neutral;I had high hopes for this special dinner  but they were dashed  Only one waiter seemed genuinely helpful  The food was very overpriced for what we received  The lasagna was tiny  burnt on the top and flavourless  There was broken shell through the pasta dish  The duck was very overcooked  Very disappointing to pay for  course   side and still water    I won t be hurrying back 
neutral; Food satisfactory  Found the service slow  Only one chef so with three tables waiting it was a long time sat doing nothing  Felt a little out of place as our table left us looking into the Bar which was quite noisy The Bar Maid was also the waitress as this was amidweek night  
neutral; This restaurant is a lovely restaurant with very nice friendly staff  a good atmosphere and a good range of daily fresh fish dishes  However  the food was not as good as we expected which were a little bland  It was a very busy evening and other reviews are very positive about the food so we may just have been unlucky  We didn t mention anything on the night as nothing particular wrong but our meals should have had better seasoning  Would try again though in the future  
neutral; Relaxed  welcoming and with a very accommodating landlord  He did us a brilliant hog roast  Minimum fuss  Maximum flavour and enjoyment  It was for a charity afternoon  We made lots of money because the event was well managed and generous 
neutral; I was booked in here as the B+B I had planned to use were unable to accommodate me  the sign says  quot Luxury Accommodation quot  its a pub with comfortable rooms  the stair case is very steep and awkward would not recommend to anyone with mobility issues   The facilities for the twin room with sloping ceiling and a tiny shower are not en suite but across the landing  room itself is cramped the bed comfortable  breakfast was disorganised with tables incorrectly set  dirty glassware and the coffee that came in a cafetiere left a lot to be desired  breakfast menu is varied the salmon and scrambled egg was quite tasty   Pub food offered a varied menu with plenty of old fashioned basics  transported back to the  s  and the daily specials which are a little more imaginative  also offers a limited vegetarian and vegan choice with scrutiny   Place seems to be staffed with local mature people who are pleasant but don t expect fast food  
neutral; The Banquet we attended th March was spoilt by the room being so cold  not much heat from the candles in the fire grate  When we complained was told it was due to it being so cold outside   The bar was chaos to order and the sitting area was not enough to accommodate the number of guests  
neutral; I booked The Gilbert Scott weeks in advance to celebrate my husband s th birthday with some of our close friends  When we arrived some of our friends had been seated away from the main bar on a table awkwardly situated by the door  We all ordered drinks but they took an eternity to arrive  more than  mins   I had to ask if they were on the way and no apology was made for the wait  As far as I could tell the bar wasn t really that busy  We then asked the waiter if our table was ready   for a while nothing happened then another person came over to ask if we were ready to be seated and when we all said yes   she seemed suprised  We mentioned that we had asked earlier if we could be seated and she said the message hadn t got through  We had a nice table in the centre of the dining room but again we had to wait for a while before someone took our drinks order then more waiting for the waiter to take food order  I m all for not being rushed but I felt the service could have been a little more attentive  We also had to wait a while for glasses of wine to be re filled because the bottle was situated away from the table  As it was my husband s th I really felt more effort could have been made   although my husband got a little plate at the end of the night with two truffles and happy birthday written on it   it seemed a little bit late  Perhaps I was expecting too much but after visits to restaurants such as Claridges and Murano s where you re treated really well and are given in between course tasters and staff are attentive  but not in an annoying way  I did feel a bit let down  The food was really nice and well presented and there is a good variety of choice but I just didn t feel the night was as special as I had hoped  And when you re paying over   for dinner  for nine people  you kind of expect staff to be a little more attentive  In some respects I regret paying   for service  
neutral; Loved the food and the waiting staff were fast and attentive  I know it is a Blues Bar but I found the place really noisy which made any conversation quite difficult  
neutral; Looked quite appealing but did find the place very very expensive  especially when you have children in tow 
neutral;As this was newly opened  we thought we give this a go   It was rather interesting let s say  We had chicken with waffles  sweet potato mash with marshmallow baked on top and just chicken in general and mini chicken burgers  It s a required taste  I usually like odd things like this but this was just a bit weird for my liking  It is a bit pricy too  Will not be going back again in a hurry 
neutral; We had a booking for  on the th Feb for my daughters Birthday  A Tuesday evening so we were expecting it to be reasonably quiet  in fact it was quite busy   which was a shame as there only seemed to be about  staff serving and  of these was on the bar  It took  minutes to get a complete round of drinks to the table  Don t get me wrong the food was nice BUT it is only burger and chips  you don t even get a side salad and for this the food is quite pricey  The staff were helpful but there weren t enough of them  Overall not the worst dining experience but certainly not worthy of the bill we were presented with at the end of the evening  I definitely won t be going back  
neutral; We had high hopes when considering the enticing and not overlong dinner menu and specials  Unfortunately only two dishes that we ordered really stood out   sweet  fresh moules in a not too salty wine and onion mariniere sauce   and a rabbit confit served with a hazlenut salad    The lamb kebabs with anchovy and rosemary were   surprisingly for the high price   made of minced lamb and had no discernable taste besides that of minced lamb  Where was the salty anchovy or rosemary tang  They were served on salad leaves that were doused with so much oil that I could not eat them  The curried sweet potato parcels tasted like they were filled with just mashed sweet potato   there was no spice discernable  let alone any curry heat  These alone cost    with their accompanying green beans  My partner  who as a Northerner  loves a good pie  pronounced the sussex steak and ale pie as average    The lavender creme brulee had no discernable lavender at all  although the accompanying biscuits did at least have the promised lemon flavour  The chocolate brownie was strangely hard   we had ordered one to split between the children and as I divided it  I was surprised the texture was more like biscuit than cake  Unusually for a brownie  nobody in our family wanted to finish it    The service was friendly  attentive and efficient  the napkins were real cloth  the dining area was warm and inviting  the beers and wine were really good quality  It was just such a shame that the execution of the meals did not live up to the promise raised by the rather expensive menu  
neutral; I always enjoy the food at Shampan   it s a  minute walk so it s convenient and we re always able to reserve a table  for   if we ever fancy going out for dinner at the last minute  However the service is always slow and my last visit was no different  so this time I decided I d write a review   I visited with my partner  we both had  drinks before any food arrived  and had to ask  times for a jug of water  and then it arrived in a pint glass  The staff are lovely  but the service is just really slow  The only beer is Kingfisher and there is only  or  wines you can have by the glass  the rest you have to have by the bottle  which is fine when there s a large group  but last night with only me drinking wine it was a bit frustrating that my wine choice then went down to either a Pinot or Chardonnay  The food arrived and was lovely  generous portions   we generally go with Chef s recommendations  we were stuffed  couldn t move  think we ate so fast as we were waiting for a while   We left enough space for the complimentary Tia Maria and creme  but overall  the slow service and having to ask for things a few times was a bit frustrating  even if it was a friday night   they should be staffed for it  There s lots of other Indian restaurants in the area so I don t think we will be back for a while  
neutral; I visited this restaurant with a friend recently  The menu is not that extensive and is quite pricey  The food was quite tasty  the service was good and the staff were very friendly  I would go back but only for a special occasion  
neutral; Nice pub  great views  but check your food bill as we have been overcharged on the last two visits   almost   the last error  and no apologies offered by any staff when the mistake was brought to their attention 
neutral;As couples we came here at both the start and end of our evening    Clearly it did enough to impress us at the start of the night   the surroundings were nice  the cocktails lovely  Cosmo for me   and the ambience upbeat    However  around our rd drink in after returning my friend and I left to visit the ladies room  obviously leaving our drinks on the table with our other halves  only to come back to a bit of a fracas   As it transpires the over eager glass collector tried to take our drinks and took great offence when he was advised the drinks were not finished  they d only had a sip taken    Now  clearly the music is loud and this was said in a loud way which could I suppose be misconstrued as aggression but if you knew our husbands you would know that would be the last thing they d do    Fast forward to the glass collector complaint and the door staff try to eject us all    So in summary  great surroundings  great drinks  poor staff and a bitter taste left to the end of the evening    Would I return  yes  But not fur a while once the experience has faded   
neutral; This was my second visit in the space of  weeks to Turkuaz with a different group of friends  I had recommended it as last time the staff were friendly  relaxed  helpful and the food was gorgeous evoking a feeling of chilled out holidays and sunny climes and it felt like a girly treat on a school night too   Unfortunately the second visit could not have been more different  After struggling to find a car parking space the greeting was rude and bordering on aggressive  We wondered if he was having a bad day as it was so shockingly bad  The food was lovely but no attempt was made to make us feel comfortable  The waitress practically threw the food across the table  We all agreed that we loved the food but not sure if we would give it another chance   or would only go if husbands went too  
neutral; but it can be very noisy because of the wooden floors and open space  The bar area is very attractive  
neutral; Went to Prezzo in Gainsborough today   a group of school friends meet here about once every  months  usually it is brilliant   absolutely  star  but today it felt like the staff couldn t be bothered   perhaps the heat  or perhaps that they were preparing the tables for an th    The restaurant wasn t busy and there were  staff plus a chef on duty   we were there at pm  They left us for so long that one of our group had to go and ask them to take our drinks order  eventually drinks arrived and we d finished those before they came over to take the food order    food arrived in good time  the problem was waiting for the order to be taken    and was  as always delicious   but then we waited for ages to have the dessert menu delivered  and eventually the order taken     and  desserts arrived  but after  reminders the Irish coffee finally arrived    apparently it takes a while to make one of those  half an hour     asked for the bill  and it arrived fairly promptly    but we discovered that % had been added as a service charge because there were  of us   would have happily paid it had the service been good   but it was rubbish   the staff were rude  we waited forever  can I say that this was a first   we have been coming here for a long time and it has always been brilliant   not sure what happened today  when we told them we weren t paying the service charge we explained that it took  minutes to make an Irish coffee  apparently it takes time   and there is a problem if they need to cook  meals at once  you are a restaurant for goodness sake there must have been  max  other people there  and at least  staff    hoping the th that they were preparing for get out before they need to celebrate their st  Disappointing  Sorry  
neutral; The restaurant was not clean and some of the tables are packed together  The food was average  once it finally arrived  
neutral; The food is fab  real traditional Cornish Pasties they just need to work on there customer service and get some friendly staff  
neutral; Took my mum and partner here for a birthday lunch  chose to go here as it s always been great in the past  it s a lovely pub  nice location and always enjoyed good food  However  this time was a little disappointing    the fish and chips has always been delicious but this time the fish was soggy and the chips were like something from a frozen bag you can buy at a supermarket :  as they seem to have changed them   which is a shame  Also not a great menu for vegetarians  very limited  You can t even order onion rings as they only come with the burger  so you miss out if you re vegetarian or just don t want a burger but would like onion rings with something else  awfully strange not to have an option as a side  They usually have a good selection of specials located by the bar but this is also quite limited for vegetarians  However if that isn t a problem for you then I would suggest trying them  They also do a good vegetarian roast dinner on Sundays  but we were told they don t always offer it  so make sure you give them a call to find out as there were a few options available when we went but you won t know this unless you ask  no idea why 
neutral; The food at Javitri was average  It s the ambiance and staff that bring up an area meal  The restaurant looks fab  Very modern  yet inviting  The staff are smart  attentive and friendly    Overall it was a nice meal  Reminded me of the Indian restaurants I d eat in as a kid  But didn t blow me away  
neutral; Thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to this friend y and efficiently run restaurant  Will certainly return  
neutral;Seated straight away by a friendly waitress who showed us the menu and explained about drinks and the salad bar  The table and floor were spotless a rarity in a fast food place especially at pm ish  The menu though not a huge variety was pretty good  something for everyone BUT VERY expensive    for plain old mac   cheese or lasagne for  person in a fast food place with no sides or anything is extreme  The salad bar has a good variety of things BUT the bowls provided were ALL dirty  So we just ordered  pizzas between the  of us with a portion of onion rings and  drink each the bill came to just over    We were a little dissapointed that we could see our food waiting to be brought over but no one did for at least mins and it wasn t particularly busy  In fairness it was still warm when we got it just not for very long  Overall the pizzas were nice and they did bring out a box for us to take any left overs home  but   for a quick bite to eat is excessive 
neutral; I have been a few times to rob Roy d   it was early in a morning and at three in the afternoon  both times we have been the service was not good  it wasn t busy  the first time I went I was told off by the waiter because I was suppose to wait to be seated  there was only us in it  the second time I asked if we could sit at a bigger table because we had young children but we were told no  They are not child friendly so I don t go anymore I now go to cannon hall  get far better treated and food quality is much better and not as dear 
neutral; Today was my first visit to The Blue Vinny  on arrival the pub looked promising with a nicely decorated interior   We looked at the menu which was ok but very little to choose from if you aren t a great meat eater  We ordered our meals and the restaurant was not very busy but we waited quite a while for our food and I m afraid all I can say is it was average my fish dish was only luke warm I know I should have sent it back  The other meals were hot but really weren t worth the price  On reading other reviews I wonder if we were just unfortunate but I don t think we would return  
neutral;Livijng just next door to this restaurant  it took me about  months to be able to make a booking  Despite the venue being busy all the time  the cuisine and experience is rather average  The tables are very small and very close to each other making it very uncomfortable  You can extensively listen to your fellow diners banter in detail and feel cramped  There is nowhere even to place your bag  even on the floor  There is a very distinct smell of bleach throughout the restaurant at all times  The menu is very limited and food itself is very average experience  Although the staff are helpful  the restaurant lacks authenticity of anything special to keep you coming back  Not one of my favourites 
neutral;This gastro pub is in a great spot  nice   quiet  We were visiting the area for a few days and saw this place our  Good Pub Guide  so decided to take a look   Two courses each and a couple of drinks cost us    which  to me  is a quite lot to eat out in a pub   My husband had a lamb shank dish off the specials board which he thought was lovely  I opted for the chicken dish on the main menu which was served on salad  I was a little underwhelmed as it cost    and I found it to be on the  safe  side and a touch boring  plus the portion was a bit small   There was a good choice of puds  all just shy of a fiver   including a lavendar creme brulee  My husband opted for a white chocolate creme brulee which was very good  I had a rasberry   honey cheescake which was OK but didn t taste of that much really   Perhaps I was expecting too much but I left a little underwhelmed  The walls of the pub were covered in newspaper articles about how great this place is so others have clearly had excellent experiences here   A nice touch was the blackboard showing where they source all their local produce   The staff were lovely and very efficient  My husband thought the food was great  so maybe it s just me    
neutral; Menu limited and also quite pricey  If you have a finicky eater in your party  not much choice  Fish  Chips  Haddock  was quite dry  lamb was overpriced for portion size  side dish of carrots and beetroot tasteless  All our meals lacked seasoning    each inc sweet no wine  just lager   
neutral;We wanted a quick informal meal   and were attracted by the meal deal   two main courses for    and desserts from a small selection an additional    each  The meal quality was quite good without being exceptional   I had a veggie bean chillie which was quite hot  The experience was somewhat marred by what we considered to be a loading on the drinks  especially glasses of wine  so with a drink each  a wine and a lager   the meal deal and no deserts we paid nearly    Ouch 
neutral;Visited this establishment for lunch with my mum and two sons  Ordered drinks first and asked the bar staff for a children s menu and she pointed over there  Well over there was a seating area and as it was my first time I didn t know  Another customer ended up showing me where they were on my way back to the table  When it came to the food I wanted the tandoori skewers asked the bar staff gota we don t have any of them  Didn t offer me an alternative choice so clearly has no understanding of the menu so I had to leave the bar to find an alternative product to find peri peri skewers so I ordered them but had to wait  minutes due to the queue  Then was told when ordering there was an over half a hr wait  In my opinion the staff should in know that menu inside out so that alternatives can be offered and children s menus in a clearer location 
neutral;I visited on a Tuesday night with  colleagues  It wasn t especially busy and the place has had a  minor  facelift recently  probably to compete with nearby Singh s  We were kept waiting far too long to be seated  to have our orders taken and to receive our food  When the food did arrive  it was rather chaotic  the waiters didn t see to know who d ordered what   The starter  botti kebab: lamb  was ordered by three of us  Mine arrived with a different sauce from the other two  When I asked the waiter why  I was told that my sauce was milder and I probably wouldn t like the usual more spicy  I was astounded to be patronised in this way   The arrival of the main course heralded yet more chaos  as well as more dishes and plates than the table could accommodate  stuff not cleared away before the food s arrival   My colleagues all got stuck into their meals while I was left waiting for the kitchen to send me the correct dish  My food eventually arrived a good  minutes later with no apology   I shan t be going back  
neutral; We ended up hear one lunch time after not being able to make it into planet bounce  We had the lunch time menu which was reasonably priced  Good service  pleasant atmosphere  The food was fine  but I much prefer the small caribbean takeaways  Not a patch on my grandmas  dad s or mum s cooking  I would eat here again but only if the takeaway is closed  My partner and kids loved their meals    maybe I m a bit fussy  
neutral;Very busy pub  Food ok but not brilliant  Locals friendly and helpful about the area and things to do or see
neutral;We ate at Cafe Rouge before going to the Cinema  We had almost  hours yet only just managed to finish our meal in time for the film   The ambiance of the restaurant was very pleasant  warm and welcoming and very authentique to French style   The waiter was a little disinterested when serving us  The starter of crab cakes  which we shared  was disappointing  Slightly cold and uncooked with no real crab flavour  The accompanying chutney tasted weird and a bit like washing up liquid   Main courses were ok  My vegetarian pasta was actually delicious  My friend s steak which she asked for BLUE arrived Medium  The waiter offered to prepare a new one but due to time we declined  We were given a complimentary coffee instead   The bill came to   which was a bit on the pricey side we thought    All in all it wasn t a horrible experience but overall was a little disappointing  I probably would try them again on the basis of the pasta dish being so tasty 
neutral;Unfortunately there are not many nice atractive pubs in Finsbury Park  Old Dairy has always been one of the nice ones  It  s a nice building  an old dairy  The crowed is mainly locals  to  mainly and some over s  Nice on Saturday evening or Sunday afternoons 
neutral; First impressions were very good  a roaring log fire  fabulous starters and main courses and then it went wrong  Mistakes can happen at busy times but it is how they are dealt with which leaves the lasting impression   My husband ordered rice pudding with satsumas but was presented with ice cream instead  We initially laughed at this faux pas and said it must be his Scottish accent but after waiting for  minutes  we asked the waitress when he would be getting his rice pudding as we were short of time  A very surly waitress eventually brought the rice pudding and said  it was your fault there was a delay  No apology or attempt at humour was made  So best advice is to have a starter and main course then coffee as all the desserts were poor  The orange sorbet was inedible and whilst one rice pudding was hot the other was still chilled  We asked for Christmas Crackers as they were already on other tables and whilst we were willing to pay for them  we were told it wasn t possible as we had not pre booked the Christmas Lunch  Bah Humbug indeed  
neutral; The food was very nice but we did have to wait some time to be served  and found the gentleman in charge to be a little abrupt  like it was to be expected we would have to wait so long  I do appreciate good  homemade food takes time to prepare  but it did not seem that busy and a simple apology would have gone a long way  The pub is however very nicely furnished  and when the food di arrive we enjoyed it  so all in all we would probably give it another go  
neutral; Visited this evening  food was very nice  However made to feel extremely uncomfortable and  quot looked down upon quot  by people on adjacent table who appeared to be well known to staff  if not the owners of the bistro  At one point it became apparent that we were being spoken about by the staff and one of the group and not in a positive manner  This ruined what could of been a pleasant experience  
neutral;this is the fourth visit here in a month We return as the food is great and the price excellent  Each time we have had a brilliant meal and we did so last week  BUT  our eating here was completely ruined by children running around and shouting throughout our time here The mothers who were equally noisy did nothing to look after their kids  We were upstairs near the toilets and the kids were in and out of them I suppose it was our fault for not asking to be moved PPlease Harvester a an area for folk who want a quiet lunch We will return again  when the kids go back to school  as the food is great and the staff nice This is no complaint on the food just the noise
neutral; Since the iconic and long lamented days of the Carved Angel under the inspired leadership of Joyce Molyneux  this quayside restaurant  still arguably the best location in Dartmouth has been through years of trouble and turmoil   After the retirement of its original patron it survived for a few years under the enduring influence of her inspirational standards and cuisine  Then came the pretensions and domestic disasters of the Burton Race Years with too much reality TV  astronomic prices and waste bins outside the window of the then New Angel  after an all too public meltdown and a failed relaunch the restaurant was reborn as Angelique which concentrated more on upholstery than haute cuisine and closed having never decided whether to be known for afternoon tea or after dark tasting menus   Now it is The Angel  simply   One hopes there are not too many more reincarnations to come  We would love it to succeed  The cherished memories of the Carved Angel regime encourage one to hope for a real revival and could this be it   Sadly  not quite  The welcome and greeting on a quiet Tuesday was lacklustre  That s your table over there  The menu was delivered upside down and the specials board identified in the far distance  I ll come and read it to you if you like  one jug of rather tepid tap water was carefully rationed amongst the diners  just half a glass each   The menu actually had some attractive choices  plenty of sea food and white fish and meat and vegetarian options  My starter of smoked and kiln roasted salmon was generous but overloaded with a complicated and unsubtle salad and too much bread  The promised butter did not materialise   My husband s seafood bisque was a mongrel concoction  partly soup de poison and not a bisque at all but flavoursome except for the inexplicable addition of salad  The whole grilled sole with prawns was well cooked but again overloaded with the ubiquitous salad and too many potatoes    My grilled ribeye was perfectly cooked and served with the most enormous onion rings the size of doughnuts  field mushrooms  chips and  yes  salad  I brought a substantial part of the ribeye away for a delicious steak sandwich the next day   So it was good value  literally more than you could eat  Willing but amateurish service  shall I pour the wine or will you do it yourself   But well priced wine at   for an Argentinian Malbec Merlot  Nice white table cloths and napkins and still the quiet kitchen from the old Carved Angel days  More emphasis on service is needed  and less salad and smaller  less overloaded plates would restore the concept of elegance rather than excess    Keep trying  Angel  we re on your side  
neutral; Restaurant was very busy food was quite good but a little pretentious for what actually turns out to be fairly standard cuisine in the Ribble Valley with a high price tag  It is located in lovely rural surroundings which makes it feel special for a romantic meal  Not good value for money  
neutral; We made a booking for midday  we received our pot of tea soon after choosing our afternoon tea selection  only allowed to choose one type of sarnie   but the pot of tea soon went cold and was all gone by the time the afternoon tea came an hour later   no apology  not sure why it took one hour to prepare sarnies  scone and slice of cake  I thought it was overpriced at   per head  quite cramped at the table as well  I have been to a tea room in FRINTON at   per head  all round much better quality and speedier service  
neutral; Lovely pizza and lasagne at a very good price  Shame service wasn t up to scratch  My cousin and I were waiting at least  minutes before anyone even took our drink order   It was not busy either  Then when they got back with my wine i went to drink it and i saw lots of black granules at the bottom of the glass  I shown the waitress and she replied by saying   Oh  thats just coffee from the glasswasher    I then had to ask her for a new one and she said   Oh  um  you want a new one  right  ok  Like it was a lot of hassle  also  the man who took our food order was very rude  
neutral; I ate a meal here with friends  The staff were very friendly  but the food was variable and a bit pretentious  Sadly the food took so long to come that we had to leave becuase the meter on our baby sitter had run out  
neutral; We ate here on Friday evening  We liked the decor and the staff were friendly  There was very little choice for demi veggies who don t eat cheese but I liked the sound of the one item on the menu that I could eat  the rissotto  Unfortunately  it came with a sprinkling of cheese but this wasn t mentioned on the menu  so I ended up just forking it away to the side of my plate  There had been a couple of issues with a dirty knife and them bringing us something we hadn t ordered  so I can t comment very favourably on the waiting staff  but the manager was very polite and apologetic when we spoke to him before leaving and did his best to ensure we left with a more postive impression  
neutral; I have shopped at Boundary years for many years and it is well worth visiting for a very large selection of excellent and well priced items at a wide range of outlets  I have often been to Banny s which has very good food and efficient service  The restaurant is also very good   The coffee shop however is not as well organised due to the logistics and operation of the food service aspects  The food at the coffee shop is of a high standard and very well priced  The patisserie is of a high standard and other items are fresh and well prepared although and well cooked   The cafe just don t work well at busy times and on my last visit  lunch time Saturday nd October  most people in the queue were commenting on how slow and poorly organised it was  Although there seemed to be plenty of staff around they weren t customer facing  There are two identical sides but neither seemed to be working well  There was only one till operating on the side I was in line  the hot food was only being served by one pleasant  but not very speedy young man and people who only wanted cold food or a drink had to queue behind those waiting for hot food  It took about  minutes from starting in the queue to actually paying  There are a very large number of seats in the cafe and it seems obvious just by simple observation that the set up of the service area is inadequate and poorly managed at busy times  I would advise going to Banny s or avoiding lunch time to anyone visiting Boundary Mill  
neutral; food was ok   not a great choice  service wasn t great  they kept trying to give us someone elses order and then wouldn t take our drinks order for ages   But the place seemed to be done up nicely  I didn t think it was up to the hype we had been hearing about it  Shame really could have been a lovely place  
neutral; I arrived in York and decided to hunt down an independent cafÇ¸ for a lunch stop  Although I was greeted by a very friendly member of staff  I was left standing amidst a queue of people who I realised were waiting to pay  I found my own table and then had to find a menu The service was poor and disorganised  I ordered some soup which was ok but not as a good as soup I regularly make at home  
neutral; Thought it was a bit over priced but staff were helpful and plugged in my scooter    only been the once 
neutral; This branch of Feng Sushi is very cosy with a great atmosphere  The sushi is fabulous and the service is second to none  The only complaint I have is that there is a strong smell of marijuana at the front of the restaurant in particular outside the front door when you pop out for a cigarette  This has put me off the branch completely and really takes from the otherwise great vibe of the place  
neutral; We arrived on a midweek evening with family to be told there was a wait for food  Although there were people already seated at tables the pub didn t look overly busy  We decided to stay and placed our orders very quickly despite the bar and waiting staff obviously being stretched  Then we waited and waited and waited  As a family we have been to busier restaurants and been served a lot quicker and it became clear that there was obviously some problem in the kitchen but we were not informed what this was  going by the lack of front of house staff  it was probably the same in the kitchen  The food when it arrived was pretty good on the whole  beware the chunky chips though  they were neither chips nor wedges and were cold and soggy  not crispy at all  Portion sizes were large so you won t leave hungry but after two visits now where the service has been less than adequate even though it hasn t appeared particularly busy we won t be going back  
neutral; I went for Sunday lunch with my son and daughter in law  and looked forward to an enjoyable and relaxed family time  Unfortunately  the sun was shining  Why is this unfortunate  you might ask  Let me tell you  It meant that they were full to bursting  with all the outside tables taken  and yet there were only a handful of waiting staff to attend  The kitchen must have been even more poorly understaffed  When my son asked why the food was taking so long  after he finally got the attention of someone who deigned to come over and not avoid our beckoning gaze  he was told:  quot Yeah  friend  The kitchen s about an hour behind  quot  No apology  No embarrassment  No charm or professionalism  Oh well  The food was actually not bad for a mass produced Sunday lunch  Not bad  though  is not really what you want when you go out to eat with your family or friends  However  it lifts my rating by one star  Fundamentally  the management here need to realise that if you understaff for short term gain  it will come back and kick you later  It even took  minutes to get the bill paid  and we left frustrated and with fraying tempers  which really was not the mood for we had wished  So   terrible service  acceptable food but not a remotely enjoyable experience  
neutral; I have eaten at Miyagi s many many times and had always enjoyed my visits there  On my recent visit I was surprised to find that they had changed the menu and unfortunately was so disappointed with the changes  The original menu had a really unique concept offering a wide variety of dishes that were really original and stood out from other restaurants that do asian Japanese food  They have not only switched to a complete quot small plates quot  concept  just like every other restaurant in the immediate vicinity  but have removed many of the dishes that made them different from other restaurants and that you couldn t get anywhere else  This new menu is certainly not an improvement where they were once ahead of other restaurants offering something unique  it s like they have taken  steps back and have blended into the background of all the restaurants that offer similar concept and similar type of cuisine  If you re eating here for the first time you will probably enjoy it as the food is still cooked to the usual good standard  but I would notbe surprised if their regulars start heading elsewhere  I know this place is no longer a stand out for me and if I fancy Japanese or Asian type food there are other places that would better come to mind than Miyagi s now  Such a shame  
neutral; We had booked our table for an early meal and there were only a few other people in the restaurant   so you d expect we d be served pretty promptly  However  an hour and  minutes later our food arrived   One meal had been completely missed off although the waitress had repeated our order fully  The chips and one of the meals was cold and I mean cold  obviously been standing around for ages  Eventually the last meal arrived but everyone else had finished by then  Not much of a family meal  All that said   the food was very tasty  
neutral; After reading the reviews we were very wary about going to this chippy  but as it s the only one in the area and we fancied a chippy tea we decided to risk it    The staff were pleasant enough and took our order quickly  The fish was freshly cooked and massive  Large portions of chips too   although the price does reflect this  not the cheapest chippy by far  The food all tasted good and what you d expect from a fish and chip shop  
neutral;We have never eaten here before so today was the first time  Went with family  thought the menu was basic mostly burgers  wanted a light bite but nothing there  Husband and myself both had burgers  and it was very good quality loads of filling  Youngest son had the brunch and this was ok  Oldest son had the pasta and he enjoyed it  In total mean was just under they had already put a % service charge on which we thought was was a bit rude as the service did not warrant this  We would not rush back here 
neutral; It is a very varied experience  so quite hard to review  I ve had some great lunches here  potato skins and sandwiches are fantastic However the breakfast was very  average   There is no consistency in the coffee  had great ones had not so good  I d caution against the luxury hot chocolate it is warm milk in a choc covered glass  However the regular hot chocolate is lovely  I ve waited ages to order at times  at other times it s been quick  The staff are helpful and clearly well trained  
neutral; had to come here after my ordeal at the slug and lettuce  the drinks  in particular the cocktails  are great and cheap  the food    well it was nice food but it wasn t great  they didn t have a lot of choice on the menu   particularly for vegetarians  when the food arrived it looked like something i could have easily bunged in the oven at home  i don t dislike this place but i wouldn t recommend coming here for a special event  it s just good for getting drunk at at the beginning of the night  
neutral; Me and the boyfriend arrived quite late in the afternoon at around    ish   Not sure on the whole arrival table seating procedure do you take a seat and someone comes over   It was only when I commented loudly  quot oh it s our first time quot  to some other diners that we were acknoledged by a waitress and shown to our table  Sat right by the till and directly in the eyeline of the kitchen   At this point it was just us and another couple in the place  We placed our drinks orders  I had a shake which I cannot fault it was delicious I recommend the oreo one  The boyfriend had a rootbeer float   Anyway they were fine  The menu system is slightly unclear with out much explanation of what the sides are  dirty fries gives the impression they are just that  Anyway we disrupted the waitress from checking her phone for a better description and placed orders    What put me of was the amount of fruit flys or small insects flying around now this could be due to the fact we were sat by some fruit for the drinks or just the grease dripping from the kitchen  Needless to say the hygiene got worse when I saw the chef stuffing his face with food and then handling customers food without a hand wash in sight  I could see it clearly as the kitchen is open  He noticed this and tried to bend down but was a poor attempt   In fairness if we weren t put off by that point the food did arrive pretty quick the fries could have been warmer but tasted great burger was good  I had a chicken one  boyfriend said his was good he asked for it cooked medium when we were asked   Overall the food was pretty good would go again and try some other things value for money wasn t bad we has the basket deal so around   per head plus drinks on top   Just keep an eye on the hygiene  
neutral;We ve been to Traveller s Rest numerous times over the last  years and can only see the lovely old pub accommodation getting shabbier and shabbier  We stayed for one night as a stop gap until we could have access to our holiday let   The location is fabulous   The views and proximity to Grasmere excellent  the main reasons for staying really   although the Jennings beer does normally play a part   Unfortunately the beer was not quite right this time  so disappointing   The evening meal was good   though we had to remind the staff about our pudding   minutes wait seemed a little excessive   It was the decor and general maintenance of the pub that was the real let us down  Yes  I know the pub is very old   another reason to go   but  paint and general attention to plumbing is just basic care  The carpet in the pub was disgusting  Flaking paint where it had been knocked  windows that wouldn t close properly  and surely light bulbs should be checked as part of servicing the rooms   All this has drawn us to decide not to return until some refurbishment has been done  It is not cheap to stay  we expect to pay more for the location  but we do expect to be able to sleep  The lack of decent window maintenance let in all the road noise  That with the poor quality pillows made it impossible to sleep soundly   But  the staff were lovely  breakfast quickly delivered and tasty  With attention to topping up coffee cups very well done   We will return again but only after some money has been spent on the place   
neutral; Went for a Groupon deal  two course steak meal  Starters were nice although the deal said any starter up to and we ended up with a choice of about  on a special groupon menu  My partners steak was fine  mine was absolutely awful  it tasted like bad braising steak  Pepper sauce was greasy  not sure why  The worst part about it was the restaurant which was really dirty  the carpet hadn t been hoovered for a while and the table had engrained dirt on that you could pick off  The best part of the night were the staff who were run off their feet but lovely  Sorry  maybe it was a bad night but it certainly wasn t a nice experience  
neutral; Food extremely mediocre and nothing to right home about  Didn t taste particularly home cooked  small portions and a fairly unimaginative menu  not good enough to return or recommend to any of my friends  
neutral;Good place to pop in and have one or two cocktails  Very crowded so would not want to stay all night 
neutral; The overall ambiance of the restaurant is lovely  We were well greeted at the door and the service was great throughout    I rang up the day before to let them know that I m vegan and would be attending a meal on the Sunday  I asked what the options were because on the menu online I could only see one vegetarian option  They couldn t specify what meal I could have but told me I d be well catered for  I trusted them as it is after all  a very nice high end restaurant    As I went in I saw the manager walking around and talking to customers so I re confirmed with him that I was vegan and asked what my options were  He went to check with the kitchen and told me there was a tomato soup starter  an aubergine linguini and melon for dessert   I ordered the soup and pasta  as my starter came there was a little mix up as they had put creme fresh on top and there was butter on my bread  This made me feel a little uncomfortable as it didn t feel reassured that they understood how to cater for vegans and I hate to complain send food back  but I had to  The new starter quickly came out and it was all fine   I was anxious about my main meal due to the mix up with my starter but it was fine  I had a aubergine linguine and helped myself to more vegetables on the table  I didn t mind the mistake too much and the manager did apologise to me   I think the restaurant should provide more options for vegetarians and vegans  I also felt that I was really overcharged as I paid   for some soup and pasta that didn t really blow me away which is what I would expect at this price  The price wouldn t have been an issue if there were more options available  A dessert on the menu would be great too to cater or both vegans and those with a lactose intolerance  I will be back if more options come available  
neutral; We went here on a Sunday because it was open and near where we were staying  The food was standard pub fare  so it served our needs perfectly well without being exceptional  rice  naan and chips with the curry was a bit much   It was nice sitting by the canal  
neutral; No vegetarian option on the daily menu and only one on the a la carte    and if you are going to charge top prices at least give us a material napkin nor a cheap paper one and have sparkling glasses and cutlery 
neutral; Service was good   we were asked about what ingredients we liked in a dish and then a particular dish was recommended   Very friendly staff and the place seemed very child friendly   
neutral; We first visited Pabna about three years ago after it was recommended by friends: we were not disappointed and had a lovely vegetarian meal  soon after we had a couple of takeaways which were also very tasty  Unfortunately  since then none of our visits or takeaways have been anywhere near as good  on occasion we ve returned in the hope that these poorer meals were just a one off  but alas no  After yet another poor mediocre meal on our visit last Saturday night with stewed vegetables in bland sauces and overcooked sticky rice we ve made the decision not to return  Such a shame  
neutral; Having dined at Bettys in Harrogate and York I felt I knew what to expect from them  As always the service was professional and the menu unchanged from the other establishments  However this branch seemed to lack the charm of the others  Not sure why but as the food is the same I can only conclude that the location whilst pretty is not as suited to the Bettys brand as the Town locations are  
neutral;We visited this restaurant on Valentines Day  Obviously this day was bound to be busy but they couldnt handle the amount of people  The food was really lovely although for vegetarians there was not a huge choice  I cant really fault the food though  very different but gorgeous tastes   The service was very slow  we saw a couple leave the restaurant as they had waited two hours for their main course   Our main course took about an hour and a half to arrive which was a bit too long  We didnt mind too much though  they had offered us a glass of prosecco each   I would like to go back as the food was very good  however I do wonder if they are like this every Saturday
neutral; my husband and I went with a family who had been before and had recommended it  We were seated quickly and staff were friendly  Our drinks arrived quickly The room was very dark and we had to use to table candle to read the menu  Our friends had decided to order what they had on their previous visit  The menu is poor choice  If you like meat and burgers fine but otherwise dont bother because there s not much else other than a couple of salad options and we all know what they look like for    No matter what burger you order  they only serve on sweet buns which didn t appeal to me  The portion sizes were small  Friends mentioned that the side salad was larger last visit  cheese was none existent on burger  They advertise homemade chips and they were definitely not  Came in a cup and when poured out onto the chopping board  plate  I counted nine chips  Plus side  my chicken burger was proper breast chicken and the steak and food overall was good  We went for desserts because it was a Birthday occasion  They looked liked frozen puds  Nothing homemade about them and expensive for portion size so dont waste your money  We wouldn t eat here again mainly due to menu and value for money  
neutral; I visited this restaurant with my partner as we were going to the Grand Theatre and my partner loves Indian food    Pros   Clean  small and cosy   very friendly and attentive staff  nothing was too much trouble to rectify and it was good value for money especially the Cobra beer    a pint  Food was OK tasty   Cons   in a curry the meat is cut into very small cubes  Our poppadoms were not freshly made  parts it a bit soft   Rice was warm than hot  My partner asked for a hot curry  taste  it wasn t  Tables are very small so if you have a few plates it s restricted  Toilet is up a winding staircase   only one toilet in the woman s  Its not a place to go for an intimate meal because the tables are too close together  
neutral; It was Thursday evening and we decided to have dinner  However  was surprised with the starter  portion size verses price  It s gluten free duck breast  The size of duck breast was the size of my smallest finger  The main courses were better and very tasty  We all had fish dishes  We shared a cheese board and enjoy our drinks  I d recommend it for its views of Liverpool  The staff were amazing  
neutral; My partner and I were visiting from Manchester late afternoon on a Saturday  where we met friends with their  month old son  We had spent well over   seated inside when  all of a sudden  before we ordered our food  two male staff asked us to  move on  as the  month old had stirred  We would not have been so infuriated if they had made us aware of their policy to not have children in after a certain time  Unfortunately  one member of staff said after  o clock and then a female member of staff said after  o clock  It is a real shame that we were not made to feel welcome and that  when we are in the area again  we will not be visiting again  
neutral; We had been to this restaurant once before the pesent owners and had not been impressed  Since it had changed hands again we decided to try it  My husband was happy with his meal but my vegetable birianyi could have been much better  However the manager came to chat to us and I told him that I found it difficult to get good flavoured veggie dishes  He wandered off for  mins or so and came back with a takeaway container full of a buttered vegetable dish for me to take home and try  Can t fault the customer service  The manager and the other staff were friendly and helpful  I would like to go again to try a different meal before making my mind up about this restaurant  I will say that the buttered vegetable meal  which we tried the next day l was delicious  
neutral; Its a nice little cafÇ¸ I suppose  got the egg bap a few times to take away which was nice  Came for lunch this time but I think its disgusting that you have to pay a lot extra if you want to sit down and eat what you have brought which then makes the prices not worth it  Not to mention lack of space in the cafÇ¸  Much better value places around  
neutral; the hotel the room and staff were all first class but the menu was very disappointing as a none meat eater but enjoy vegatables and fish not much choice hardly any vegies and seeing as there is a really good garden with lovley greens growing we thought we were in for a treat but not so wishy washy watery mess in my dish with tiny slithers of carrot and beans  we would recommend the hotel but say eat else where if possible  James Martin needs to keep a better eye on things after watching him on Saturday kitchen and the dishes he makes was looking so forward to my meal 
neutral; Visited here last sat with a group of  girls  We were celebrating my sisters hen do and decided to have a nice meal out  The pub looked lovely and seemed welcoming    Bad points:  Waited ages for drink service Waited  min before our order was taken Waited an hour for food   however that wasn t too bad as the good was evidently fresh    Good points: Staff were very friendly and helpful The food was delicious and fresh The price was reasonable 
neutral; We visited here with family for my dads th  Food was nice  the staff at the table were friendly  the girl behind the bar on the other hand wasn t    It was nice    That s all  nice  It was nothing to really rave about  
neutral; Went for a meal at dinner time i was really looking forward to a nice Curry  it came on a plate with the curry in a small dish on a plate with some chips on the side covered over with  poppadoms   a naan bread on another plate this was ok but you could tell it had been microwaved  it was very floppy   this was actually tastier than the curry which had  small pieces of chicken in it  after eating my poppadoms i approached the chips  there laid dead was a small fly on a chip i was about to eat   i thought it was a black bit you get from fryers  the waitress took it away   offered me a replacement but by then was put off the rest of my dinner  i asked for my money to be refunded which they did with plenty of apologies  It was a shame but to me you couldn t miss it especially the way it was laid on its side  long time before we go back there again 
neutral; The food was lovely when if it arrived but the service was extremely slow  We had pre booked for a birthday meal but the restaurant wasn t prepared at all  It took over an hour for our order to be taken despite the fact there was only one other group of people  Main courses arrived a different times  with side orders not arriving until the meals where nearly finished  The one child s meal  for a baby  did not arrive at all  despite me asking at least three times how long it would be   being assured it was on its way  
neutral; It s worth going here for the setting alone  Symondsbury village is gorgeous and the conversion of old farm buildings into a cafe is impressive  Inside is light and airy and a lovely place to sit looking out onto the terrace which will be a hit in the summer  The menu is short and pretty basic  We went for breakfast and those of us who chose the full English were not disappointed   huge portions  freshly cooked but no surprises  I ordered a cheese omelette and it came on it s own on a big white plate  No garnish  not even any toast which had to be ordered separately  It all looked a bit sad and somehow it didn t seem very generous  It doesn t cost much to put a couple of grilled tomatoes onto the plate and it would have made an OK breakfast rather lovely  I hope this place gets into it s stride as I d love to go back but they need to concentrate on the food now that they ve got the building right  
neutral;Second trip in last month  decided to give it another go after last experience  Some of the most fed up looking staff ever seen on both occasions  The girl behind the till glared at the lady I was with and never smiled once  despite my friend s wide smile  The tables were uncleared and dirty when we arrived  Eventually after we had cleared them  we got a quick swipe with a cloth  Lunch came fairly quickly  baguettes all round but fillings very variable   though the fries were good  Glass for drink dirty  Girl who brought the food was smiley so that was an improvement  All in all not a great experience and at nearly   for  baguettes and  fries plus soft drink   about   spent between us all  we all agreed we ve had much better 
neutral; The Food Here Is Very Good But Extremely OverPriced   The Service Was Awful  Two Waitresses And We Had To Wait Alot Although The Place Was Empty  The Chefs Ended Up Serving Is Mainly   The Restaurant Itself Though I Thought Was Insane  Proper Bubbly Crazy Japanese  The Spinning Food And Kawaii Decor I Really Enjoyed    Good Experienced But Wouldn t Come Here Again In A Hurry  
neutral;A girlie night out at the theatre was dampened by lack of taste :  I would like to say that the waiter was new and this is no reflection on his second shift as he was very helpful while serving  I can t say the same about the food   Two of our main meals were lacking flavour  ingredients   just not edible  They need to change the recipe of the cod risotto and stuffed pepper   They did remove the items from the bill ~ when they figured out how to ~ bearing in mind ~ we were going to the theatre and were now pressed for time   All in all it wasn t a fantastic experience and unfortunately won t be going back as it did put a damper to the beginning of the evening 
neutral; Nice venue  staff friendly an welcoming  We booked a table online a week before but on arrival they didn t seem to have our reservation but they found us a table an we didn t have to wait   The food was alright  Average  I ordered stuffed taco shells  however when they come out they were a tortilla wrap held together by a wooden stick  Tacos an tortilla wraps were more Mexican in my opinion not Thai   Ordered the pork ribs for main  found it to be quite fatty in parts   Didn t feel like the food was Thai cuisine  Been to other Thai restaurants in the city which are a lot nicer  
neutral; The presentation was probably better than the food  A little pricy but standard for place to eat for a quick and stylish dinner  
neutral; This is something of a local for us  a short evening bike ride away  Previously weve had some lovely meals here but on our last visit we only wanted a portion of chips  After a  min wait we questioned where they were  Not surprisingly a portion of chips promptly arrived  Sadly these were stone cold  When we complained we were told these were not the right order of chips   At this point we asked for a refund and left  We understand that everyone gets it wrong sometimes but perhaps the lack of apologies from the staff was the most disappointing   We love having a drink here  the location is fantastic  and the pub is very nice but food and service is still to be improved  
neutral; Four of us visited this highly recommnend  star restuarent for the first time last night in anticipation of a gastronomic treat  By the time we left we had tasted the six course menu at   per head and drank two expensive bottles of red wine but we were all still hungry  All six courses could have easily fitted onto one average dinner plate with room to spare   None of the food was exceptional and some of the combinations like pan fried skate with strawberry sauce or aparagus cream for desert just did not work for me at all  One course consisted of a single piece of asparagus  with a dollop of sauce  my amercian friends could hardly believe their eyes and we all had a laugh  they can t be serious    Suffice to say it did not compare with other similar price restuarants like Marcus Wareing or Gorden Ramsey and the decor in the room was dull and in need of inspiration  Not sure I would recommend when there are so many other fantastic restuarants to choose from in London  Dotty Fanshawe  London 
neutral; My husband and I ate at this restaurant on Saturday evening  we had been told it was difficult to get a table but they managed to fit us in  On arrival we were met at the door by a very brusque front of house manager  who seated us and then left us  we were finally served by a charming waiter who took our order  The noise level in the restaurant at the beginning of the meal was bad but halfway through a large party arrived and it beacme  so much for a romantic evening  The food when it arrived was good but not that special and the service by the end of the meal was non existent because they were too busy trying to cope with all the tables and people waiting a the bar area to be seated  We skipped desert because of the wait and you just couldn t hear your partner talking   On leaving the same overbearing front of house manager watched me struggle into my coat and dashed off to sort out more chaos  It struck us both that unless you were a local you didn t count   We ate at the hotel the following night and had a far nicer meal in a much better atmosphere  The Jetty is overpriced and pretentious  
neutral; I ve had ice cream from here for over twenty years  and the quality is excellent  so whenever I am in the area  I like to go to the parlour  I say again  the product is excellent  so it is with heavy heart I continue the review This trip was on the bank holiday weekend  and I was disappointed that  despite turning up to the parlour for sundaes for a family at least twenty five minutes before the advertised closing time  we were met with a pretty much closed parlour  a closed down coffee machine  staff fitting of Fawlty Towers and enough bleach on the floors that had been closed early that it felt like chemical warfare  enough so to drive us to order and eat outside Don t get me wrong   the ice cream is BRILLIANT    But make sure you are early  We will go again  because the quality  local produce and tradition is worth it  but Bond s need to step up on customer service   local knowledge and goodwill won t last forever    
neutral; I have eaten there quite a few times since it opened and think Uno Momento has improved a lot  It has become much busier early evening and their  early bird  menu is good value and clearly that s what brings in many customers  Whilst I haven t eaten there since last November   it s certainly on my list for next time  The food is typically Italian pasta dishes and pizzas  the staff have always been friendly and obliging   though at busy times it s likely you would have to wait  
neutral; Inside the restaurant is really plush even a trip to the toilets felt sumptuous until inside and the hand driers not working in ladies so toilet paper all over sink as no bins either  i had a selection of Mezes one being Saganaki and i have to say having lived in Greece for some time i was never served Saganaki made with Cheddar Cheese  Feta at a push maybe but usually a general greek cheese halloumi or kesseri  never cheddar so i was dissapointed with this  The lamb i had was very fatty and chewy  At no point did anyone come and ask if everything was o k or if we would like any more drinks so after our mains we paid and left  i would go here for drinks as the bar area was really nice but i would not go here again to eat  
neutral; We only ended up here as Riley s fish shack was closed  The service is a bit slow although staff very nice and friendly  Limited menu  nice if you just fancy a coffee and a chat  Nice chilled atmosphere  
neutral;I found the staff to be helpful but perhaps not as aware of food intolerances as you might expect  Reasonable prices and low key but not quite at the same level as Farmacy around the corner  However  it isn t pretentious so maybe a more accessible option for a lot of vegans than Farmacy 
neutral; I was very apprehensive when I first visited here  But was pleasantly surprised  The service was good  the food choice is decent  the food quality is good and the speed of service was exceptional  Would eat there again  
neutral; It s a lovely place   great atmosphere and nice food but it is at the more expensive end of the spectrum and you can t help but think that there s better value to be had in Bristol  That said  we enjoyed our meal  and massive portions   
neutral; This was my first visit with my husband to this particular Harvester as we usually go the Harvester at Snuff Mills  Frenchay  The pub restaurant was quiet and we didn t have to wait long to sit down  It was a bit dark and didn t have much atmosphere  We had to wait a little while to be served but the lady who served us named Vonda more than made up for the wait  She was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the items on the menu  For starters we had the chicken dippers with Barbeque sauce  The dippers were dry so the sauce didn t really help at all  For the mains we had the platter   BBQ wings  ribs with fried prawns and chips  To be honest I found the chicken a bit bland and lacking with sauce  The ribs were not soft and juicy either and not enough sauce again although you got little pots of BBQ sauce on the side I just found the whole dish lacking in flavour  The chips were good  I forgot to mention the salad bar which you can refill your bowl with as many times as you like  I was a bit put off the salad as someone had but the blue cheese dressing spoon in the thousand island dressing bowl and I am not keen on blue cheese  In all it was okay but I think the place could do with a new lease of life to make it look brighter and more appealing and I think the chefs need to taste the food before it goes out of the kitchen because chicken dippers should be tender with a touch of crispiness  Would I go again possibly only because of Vonda and her very pleasant manner  She was lovely  
neutral;Dined about pm  lovely food  overpriced thought  spoilt by a party in The Loft we were right underneath   all we could hear were children stomping   banging their feet  then they were running downstairs to the bar
neutral; this is just pub grub  you order at the bar  get your own knives and forks and condiments  Its fair priced and the fish and chips were ok and was hot  
neutral; I visited today for Sunday lunch  We had the table that l booked for by the fireplace and we were served almost immediately  I ordered a large glass of Chardonney and my husband a beer shandy and two roast dinners  We didnt wait long for the drinks and the lunch came quickly but unfortunately it wasnt very warm at all  We asked for extra gravy as there wasnt much of it  We should have complained then about the temperature but ate it before it got even colder  The waiter to be fair was rushed off his feet not enough staff on at all  We have been there many times and usually have a good visit but today it wasnt  The table opposite a party of  had to wait ages for all there courses and also complained amongst themselves that the food was cold but not to the waiter  The wine by the glass is extremely expensive  It would be better to buy a bottle even if you had two glasses  We will visit again but l think on a Sunday it is very hit or miss    I wish l asked them to put my dinner in the microwave for a minute or two to re heat it    
neutral; The food was ok but lack of seafood choices for customers that can t have anyting spicy    Very noise and busy  Not able to have a conversation without shouting and spaces between tables are minimum  so you kinda feel you are eating with all the family  that you never seeing before   Service was great  STRAWBERRY LEMONADE is a must    
neutral; Some of the food at Bamboo was great  and some a bit average  The second time we went however we waited  minutes and then found a hair in the food  So sad  When we told the waitress she seemed cross with us  It is not a cheap place so we won t be going back there in a hurry  I don t know what to do to find a good sushi place in Bath sorry to write a negative review  it s an unusual thing for me to do but this was an awkward situation  
neutral; After hearing a few good things about this Pub from Friends we decided to go there in May with another couple    Hmmm don t think we will be returning anytime soon  We reserved a table for  pm for a party of four  The reservation name was wrong  but hey ho   we got our table  The Pub was quite busy with still quite a lot of children running around  The menu looked impressive  the prices reasonable too  There was a sign at the bar saying there was a  minute wait for food  We waited in line to order for a good   minutes  To start we ordered the  Hot Hot Hot Wings   These were to be for all us to share as they were described as being a portion of   thus being  each  We don t claim to be Absestos Mouths  but these could of been hotter  We only got  Wings  When mentioned to the waiter  this was merely  Shrugged Off   One of our party Ordered the oz Steak  this is served on a plate that is far too small and it was impossible to even cut into the steak as it was over hanging the plate  He asked for a bigger plate  the waiter gave him another plate but the same size as the original  He was asked again for a bigger plate  I ordered the oz Rib Eye Steak  I asked for my Steak to be Rare  I was served Medium  but I enjoyed it anyway  Was really tasty  The miniscule portion of Mushy Peas I asked to accompany my Steak was tiny  I asked for the Pulled Pork Topper for my Steak  This was served in a small bowl and brought out after my Steak was and I found it Bland and very Dry  The drinks were expensive  In my opinion for a bottle of Lager  in a pub  We stayed for a couple of games of Pool and left  Don t think I could recommend to Friends or Family  too many  Small Errors    They all add up  
neutral; We ate at this pub  years ago and had a good experience  However  this year  we were told they were not cooking food on the Thursday lunchtime  so we went to the Hunter s lodge Inn and had an excellent experience  
neutral; I had dinner at Cinnamon Kitchen last night with a colleague  We were sat outside in the tent area which sounds awful but it was actually very nice  There were heaters so plenty warm enough but got them turned off half way through as they weren t necessary  Like other reviews  we were also offered water when we sat down then waited too long for the water to come or to have the chance to order our food  The wine is expensive and there are no cheaper red wine options  Overall  I would visit again as the food was nice although I chose the lamb biryani which was average  my friend s lamb saddle was delicious   Service could be improved  
neutral;We booked this for a birthday meal based on reviews and with only a couple days notice for a Saturday night got one of the last bookings available  The starters were lovely but found the main  carbonara  disappointing  The children s menu was very limited and both menus were rather pricey  The place is lovely with a nice garden area and very friendly staff and regarding facilities only the loud hand dryer right next to the baby changing mat wasn t ideal 
neutral; I have visited a few times and although I like the decor and the food is decent  it is on the expansive side  For example a large glass of red wine and the same in white was over 
neutral; Wow  what a stunning place   such a shame this lovely pub was let down by it s service  on our arrival we told the bar staff that we had arrived  we had pre booked a table earlier on in the day   After getting our drinks we then waited   waited to be given some menus In the end my partner asked for some which they brought at once After ordering   shown to our table we overheard another waitress telling the table next to us of the night s specials  we had not been told of any specials   was a little disapointed as i would have had one of the dishes After waiting quite a while we were served with our food  it was lovely  a little expensive but well presented  we then had to ask the waitress if she would take our sweet order after waiting quite a while after she cleared the main course   other tables seemed to be getting served much quicker   
neutral; Brian is very friendly but notice the price are much expensive now  Ordered the ribs  the flavour are tasty but there s not much meat on it  Maybe just one off  will try again  
neutral;Went here for Saturday lunch with my nieces following a trip to the theatre  Angelina Ballerina   This restaurant was VERY cold and the little ones had to sit in the coats during the lunch  Annoyed that although they give the children colouring pencils etc they all needed sharpening and therefore could not be used   Food was standard for Pizza Express but enjoyed by everyone  Probably nicer places and cheaper places to eat in Norwich
neutral;Great food  great selection of drinks  And the staff are nice  But the service is pretty bad unfortunately  you can wait up to  minutes to get a drink and the portions of food have changed to a ridiculous measure  Clearly a budget saving exercise  with the right management or owners this place could be a goldmine and the best place to drink in Surbiton  I ll wait with bated breath I truly love this place and would love to show you how to run it efficiently
neutral; Lovely food  ambience and good service  we attended as a family for a lovely cooked breakfast  good menu choice and good value  Staff attentive  good service 
neutral; Converted from the old railway station  the place has a nice character feel about it   The food is as expected   not Michelin star   just hearty pub grub  
neutral; Our second visit to the Croft Restaurant  unfortunately the quality of the food appears to have gone a bit downhill since last year  Wine list is a little limited for a restaurant  about   white wines  and the one bottle we selected was out of stock  The food was distinctively average  the pork belly we ordered was reheated and over cooked  Will give this one a swerve next time  
neutral; Went out for a nice family meal but was overall not happy with the food I received  I order a chicken and pasta dish and I have to say the chicken felt and tasted very rubbery and the pasta seemed a little under cooked  some said the pizza was  quot good quot  and the same for the ice cream and dough balls maybe just avoid the pasta  Also the receipt adds an extra % to the bill to tip the staff which wasn t requested and also was not told that it was there  thankfully we noticed  Overall nice restaurant with the modern interior  service wasn t excellent  definitely not  star  
neutral; Typical city restaurant   not enough room between tables and noisy at times but a reasonable meal for the price paid  
neutral; Having been looking forward to an afternoon tea and cake   I was unfortunately very disappointed  A very small choice  and very over priced    yes the sandwiches were nice  but it would be really difficult to get a sandwich wrong  the scones were I have to say amazingly good  especially with clotted cream and jam The other cakes were very nice as well but    in the real word  a round of bread  and a few cakes and a cup of tea really isn t worth    A few more sandwiches a few less cakes and about at least   off the price then it would be much better   My friend got me a voucher    If you are thinking of getting one for you friend or family   don t bother 
neutral; We had planned to visit Turf Locks whilst on our cycle journey from Exeter to Dawlish and were really looking forward it to it as have had many great things  Unfortunately we were really let down when we arrived at pm being told that food stopped being served at  pm and weren t reopening the kitchen  The location was fantastic with great views but really disappointed on a lovely August summers day during school holidays to learn that there was no food to be served  Several other families and couples turned up too to receive this disappointing news  Would of been great to see it displayed on a website or facebook page  
neutral; Some really good reviews on here so perhaps we caught them on an off day  Lovely decor and attentive young waitress however my scone had so clearly just been warmed up in the microwave and was very sad indeed  
neutral; Very wam welcome  One lady behind the bar who seated us  with a warm smile  who was serving food also   Run ragged    Need more staff    
neutral; Booked in for sons birthday meal   his choice  we got there before our son  around ten mins early and were shown to our table by the window   very nice view  but then we re completely ignored for  minutes until we managed to catch someone s eye to order a drink   It wasn t even busy for the amount of staff that they had on  The menu was very uninspiring  nothing jumped out you  no specials board that we could see or were told about  Food that we had was nice  well presented and hot  Cocktails were good too  
neutral; A busy day in the cafe   tasty treats on offer   Staff helpful and can t do enough to help a fussy eater like me   I recommend the carrot cake   
neutral;Went for a colleague s birthday lunch  thought it was expensive for what we chose  unless they had forgotten to add some of the topping to our sandwiches   
neutral; Went here on Wednesday rd dec with my family for my fiancÇ¸ th birthday to celebrate before we went to New York  Have been here twice before so knew the food was amazing so thought we would come back  It was a shame we did not have a good experience  Firstly my family got there early to get some drinks  they had to wait a while to get drinks as the owner was the only one who could serve drinks because the other two waitresses were under age  We had a table so we re seated  restaurant wasn t very busy at this time  We had to wait a while to get menus  we kept asking the two waitresses which looked like it was there first day  eventually the owner saved the day and gave our menus  We eventually ordered and they ran out of the pork so only one person could have it  why did they not say at the start they only gad one left  The food was amazing  Shame about the service  I would go back just for the food 
neutral;Found a hair in one of the dishes  I called them up to tell them and they said that the next time we went there we could have one free dish  I never did return  surprisingly   The rest of the dishes were nice but I was paranoid after that one takeaway  It was a long time ago and they were relatively new at the time  Not sure if it makes a difference  Get a takeaway from Viceroy instead 
neutral; The service was great  the food was good too  the desert was very nice as well   but the portions were soooooooooooo small I couldn t believe my eyes  I so was embarrassed of seeing the food in front of me  I started to feel stupid of going to this restaurant   I ordered the Honeycomb cannelloni  ways  which costs and I only got  cennellonis  that s right    Each of them was a bite  I paid more than  GBP for  BITES  I was SO SAD   We were thinking that maybe the dishes could be too big  like Zizi s   so my husband ordered a smaller portion of Pumpkin Panzerotti   My God  he only got  pieces of ravioli on his plate  It was sooo depressing I thought it was supposed to be a healthy full of flavor restaurant  not a ripoff  
neutral;They have a huge selection of teas  if that is your thing  Some good cake too    But don t eat lunch there when there are a few people before you  We were  people  the man got our sausage orders wrong  wrong tea  too  and each portion of food was served at a different time  so I only got mine  after being presented with a wrong plate  after one of our group had finished theirs 
neutral; Food was ok  took a bit of time for our main to come out but was nice  Would eat here again  staff were friendly  
neutral; Seated straight away early evening  ordered drinks and asked did we want any nibbles whilst looking at the menu  this was ok but didn t stop there  ordered the sharing platter which at    comprised of  tiny sausages   chicken skewers  lamb kofta   hummus felt this was poor value and wished we had ordered separate starters  Ordered Chicken Caesar Salad which was cold  cold chicken topped by an icy cold poached egg no idea where the dressing was  The fish pie was piping hot but was tasteless mostly just mashed potato very dry  The waiter when taking the order constantly asked did we want sides with that  did we want another drink  We didn t complain about the food just won t return  plenty more fish in the sea    
neutral; We arrived late for our reservation  however the staff were very gracious about this  The various amuse bouche were interesting and delicious  Although butter was put on the table no bread was offered to us and we had to ask for some  The starter was presented beautifully  but it was put in front of us so sloppily that the decoration and part of the side collapsed  The Butternut soup purÇ¸e was barely tepid and under seasoned  The rest of the meal was delicious  I thought the wine was very overpriced  The response we had from the staff when our taxi never turned up was very poor  
neutral; I went there a couple of weeks ago with my italian friends  Our expectations were very high but we were disappointed about the food  Really far from the italian one in my opinion  You can t put cream on shrimps and oysters  And Arancini were no really tasty  The Customer service was really frendly attentive and nice   stars only for them  
neutral; We were grateful to stumble across this place at feeding time for us and for baby  The menu looked very promising  lots of choice  Chair with armrests   tick  They did not have my first choice of mackerel and the vegetarian dish was drowned in balsamic but otherwise pretty tasteless and overcooked  We ordered some humous  which came with a tiny portion of bread and bizarrely  with cucumber and peppers embedded in it  When we requested additional bread we were served stale bread    It seems that someone had forgotten the tahini  Not good   Fantastic that all the dishes including the unusual but tasty tiramisu  were made on site  Staff were pretty helpful and the vibe was good  Food and cleanliness need a bit of effort    
neutral; The decor and atmosphere were lovely  it s modern  warm and friendly and the service was excellent  The food was OK but nothing to write home about  The sea bass was cooked well but the smoked salmon starter was over salty and quite uninteresting  They have a strange gimmick where all desserts are served in Kilner jars which looks good   and different   but results in making the contents soggy  The biscuit base of a cheesecake is the best bit for me but it was all soggy  ditto the nougatine on the chocolate mousse  What a shame  I have marked this good for value because we used a voucher deal  I wouldn t be as happy if I had paid full price  
neutral; Had a lovely time over Saturday lunch for  families  The pub and its staff were very welcoming and the food was delivered very quickly  The only downside was the tiny potions served to the children  The child s roast was great but the standard children s menu should be avoided if your children are more than about  years old  The barbecue chicken portion and the macaroni cheese were tiny and all meals came with salad covered in dressing  We asked for some plain salads  which the staff very quickly served us  but my    and  year old were all still hungry even after their scoop of ice cream  Less salad and more meat pasta would make another visit worthwhile  
neutral; This  we thought was quite a find in a busy part of town on a busy summer Sunday  It looked extremely civilised and the menu was tempting  but after we had perused it and decided  the waiter then told us that the deep fat fryer was broken so they couldn t do anything requiring frying   which put paid to about half the menu  We managed to find salads  sandwiches etc which were pleasant enough  but my goat s cheese tart was microwaved and therefore soggy  Husband wanted ginger beer  and was told they d run out   on the way out we noticed two full bottles of same on the bar  Daughter requested hot chocolate  which wasn t on the menu  and they managed that  So  a mixed reaction to the place   but we saw some afternoon teas being served which actually looked so amazingly good that I quite want to return and give it a second chance  
neutral; The decor is lovely  Most of the waiters are OK but we had a rude one this evening  Clearing our table hurriedly    prematurely and with a bit of an attitude  Food was OK  
neutral; The naan bread was amazing  The presentation of the food was lovely  The only problem was it seemed really expensive unless you have the banquet which was about   each  You have to have  of you doing that option  and one of us was really fussy and didn t like the mains on offer  so we couldn t have the deal  Instead it cost around   for  mains  plus an extra rice  as one only came with naan   poppadums and tap water  If we had had the main we would have got a drink each  poppadums a sharing starter and a main  The food was really nice though  but not that amazing that I would want to go back there  
neutral; Went to Pizarro yesterday for a business lunch  the restaurant itself is a real treat  Gorgeous in design   a very rustic feel   and a warm ambiance  We started with a bottle of Cava  which was warm   slightly disappointing  We worked our way through several starters  croquetas  jamon iberico  prawns  The portions are quite small   expected of course with tapas  but then they are   a go so quite pricey  For main we tried every dish on the menu  everything from Hake  to Lamb shoulder  to Pork  to Stuffed Aubergine  All of them were lovely although not amazing  Quite simple  rustic cooking  I wasn t blown away by this place  like I was at Brindisa    and I felt pleased I hadn t had to pay for it myself  Surely a sign  Worth a visit none the less  although I ve heard next door s Zucca is far better  
neutral;Welcoming staff  waitress very pleasant although she insisted on calling us  quot Guys quot  all the time which was really annoying after a while  two out of four of us were women  The waiter who brought us our food also did the  quot Guy quot  word thing  Drinks were bought out very quickly  although we had about a   minute wait for our food  We all had the Sunday Roast Chicken meal  Yorkshire pudding floppy  soggy and flat  Roast potatoes very furry and tasteless as was the cauliflower cheese  where was the cheese New potatoes had a lot of black holes in them  Despite it saying on the menu  unlimited potatoes and veg  The first amount brought our was not enough for four people  Roast chicken not as succulent as it was on our first visit even though they had been cooked on a rotisserie 
neutral;If I had to rate the restaurant on food alone  then it would be very favourable   the meal was excellent  so the chefs definitely deserve to be credited   Unfortunately  the customer service was awful and I m guessing we weren t seen to be  the right clientele  for their establishment  We were shown to our seat by one of the hostesses  who was friendly enough  But when the mother and son at the table next to us were shown in by a different hostess  she kindly offered to take their coats so they didn t get crumpled on the chairs  which is where ours were dumped   and talked them through the whole specials board  making a big effort with them   When it came to us leaving  there were two of the management staff stood nearby  blocking my exit from the restaurant  Rather than offering to move  they continued to stand in my way  even after I d said  quot excuse me quot   At that point  one of the two men walked straight into me  knocking me out of the way and didn t apologise in any way  The other man  obviously realising I was slightly taken aback  asked if anything was the matter  unsurprisingly  I just walked out in a bit of a huff   Since service is quite a crucial part of a restaurant experience  I think it s safe to say we won t be going back and we ve made sure all our friends know not to go back either 
neutral; Average pub food no check back whilst eating    long waiting time food temp just warm   since sizzling food come in rest of menu gone downhill not evry wants a bed of onions either   
neutral; Bit of a weird one Cedar Farm Cafe   the menu used to be rubbish for vegetarians but now it is fantastic  The food and drinks are always really  really nice    It seems though that you have to go at the right time of day   or be the right sort of person  If you go in on a Saturday morning  or probably bank holidays etc  you will be faced with lots and lots of spandex clad cyclists looking at you as though you don t belong there  My friend and I popped in one weekday afternoon and it took forever to get served  despite staff frequently looking at us  I don t know if it was because we are quite young  because we dress in darker clothes than most or if it was just a case of rubbish service  Also upon paying we were treated quite differently than I do when I go with my mum  I don t know why we didn t leave and go to the other cafe to be honest   If you manage to get in at the right time though  and do manage to get table service  I would recommend the basket of toast  welsh rarebit or homemade scones  There is also a nice selection of bottled drinks like elderflower presse  
neutral;We visited here late Saturday afternoon for a birthday meal    The service when we walked straight through the door seemed promising with the receptionist greeting us and sitting us down at our table   I did requested a bottle of Prosecco on the table for arrival  which never came    The cocktails were amazing  And the food was absolutely phenomenal and I can not fault  I ordered the Seafood paella for my main  and it was delicious   Trying to get the attention of staff was virtually impossible   we ended up ordering two drinks each at a time as we knew we wouldn t be able to order another one otherwise    Maybe if diners could shout  quot  quot  then we d get some attention  as the staff would all go running when they heard  quot  quot  from the kitchen pass    Poor service but excellent food    
neutral; They have nice drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic  Sometimes somebody plays the piano so the ambience is generally nice  Food   nothing special  Prices  expensive  
neutral; The pub is very well located  has good selection of beer bitters as well as nice home made spirits  Had chips there  so can t really comment on food  but I heard negative comments at the table next to ours  which resulted with complaint and bringing the plate back to the kitchen  Pimms is way overpriced and unfortunately  it was the worst pimms mix I ever had  Ordered  in a row and it didn t get better :  Given the season and its price  bar should pay a little bit more attention  Also  staff was very unfriendly  no smile  never cleared the table  we ve been there for  h  and or asked if we would like another drink  Shocking  If you need wifi  you need to register  they use The Cloud wifi   no parking  no back garden  There is tv  so we could watch the match  which is a plus  
neutral; Not the finger sandwiches you would expect  but the selection offered was a little dry   With the name of marco Pierre surely the restaurant could come up with some more interesting savouries  Service was a little lacking  Waitress seemed to have her mind not on her job  Tea bought for one of our party of four no milk  Tea was teabag and poor quality at that  Tea was luke warm by the time we could get her attention 
neutral; The service was fine  The place was more empty than it used to be  and I m thinking that this is because of the standard of the food  Was very disappointed with my meal  and even the chips arrived three parts cold  Have not had what I would describe as a  good  meal at this pub on my last three visits  As a family we have decided that we are unlikely to be returning there for any special occasions  but may use it purely for convenience as it is a handy distance away for travelling to  
neutral; There were  adults and  children in our party   we waited to be seated but they did accommodate us all on one table   a few of us had the carvery which was OK but veg was quite dry and very hard   meat was good though   others chose off the pub menu and their meals were OK   nothing special really   had to send a kids meal back as the beans were extremely dried up   desserts  disappointing amount of custard served with the sticky toffee pudding  had to ask for extra   overall it was just OK   was quite busy but that s no excuse   will give it another try one day  
neutral; Lovely staff really welcoming  not a bad menu  given bread and olives a nice touch  food was wat I would call average  was taken aback wen the brought burnt garlic bread out which I couldn t eat  it also was only a sliced loaf with pesto garlic and cheese on  I would recommend that one of the chefs go to San giovanni and sample food there 
neutral; The guy who served us  micheal was very nice and and very helpful but the food was just average and not good value for money :  
neutral; You would expect  walking into an Italian restaurant  to experience the aroma of herbs  garlic  fresh bread and delightfully seasoned sauces emanating around the restaurant  Instead  there is undoubtedly a lack of all of these when you enter the place  If you want  quick  out of a packet and into the microwave meals  or haven t experienced true Italian food  then this is the place for you  They often cater for large parties  and tend to give priority to these groups with regards to service and friendliness  The only time we got a forced smile from the waitress  was when we left our tip  If you want authentic Italian food  and to experience the warmth of the Italian culture  then go further afield  and leave the franchises behind    
neutral; Thought we would try out Buddies today  Came away very disappointed  The service was very good  my son ordered an American burger with fries and coleslaw same as my husband and I ordered pancakes with fries and bacon  My fries which were very chunky   and not cooked and pancakes were Luke warm  We had shakes too which were okish  The bill came to   which I thought was a little expensive  I don t normally complain but feel I should warn others before they go  Not one of my best family experiences :  
neutral; Wasn t that impressed with the service considering the price you pay   Staff didn t understand what I had ordered  food took a while too come and kids were getting restless   Dont think We will visit again  Shame  
neutral; Me and my partner have been to Jamie s several times  each time trying to persuade ourselves that it will be better than the time before  Unfortunately each time has been a disappointment and we will not be returning any more   The food is so average it s unbelievable   there s no flavour in any of the main dishes and you feel as though you could easily bosh something together at home which is far more acceptable   Don t waste your money   this restaurant has nothing to do with Jamie Oliver bar the name  
neutral; Not having been here for a couple of years the place had hardly changed but the service is still as slow  maybe not looking at your phone when you re working might help    although the younger staff were very keen  Great position  lovely venue to sit down after a refreshing walk  cosy yet spacious but mediocre coffee  
neutral; We went on the way home and decided to pop in for some lunch  It was Sunday and they we re serving regular meals as well as roasts  We both decided due to the heat we would order the ploughmans and for compared to the    sandwiches which came with salad and chips  so we expected quite a nice spread  Im a Coealic  gluten intolerant so it was lovely to find they had gluten free bread  However when they arrived it wasn t really a ploughmans just a deconstructed sandwich with  pickled onions and some coleslaw   for the price it really wasn t worth it  Even my husband commented how little bread and salad there was and he never moans  Then to top it a glass of diet coke was A bit steep   Sadly won t be stopping in again   
neutral; table was booked for pm   nobody came to take our order till pm  the food was ok chicken livers very tasty  evey body in our group enjoyed the starters  mixed reviews on our mains bland seabass  fatty steak and this was fillet  please check your bill as we were over  charged for drinks but that was rectified  all in all pret ty average nothing special ps this is not written by local competition but real customers  
neutral;Staff in general are great  if they are busy will still acknowledge you  be with you as soon as etc   in today   not a regular but a quite frequent visitor for a quick beer or two   manager visits the till sees myself and the better half  no be with you or whatever  no service  minutes later  perhaps managers need a customer service course  Last visit for me 
neutral; We ate here over  years ago and it was lovely and wanted to return  we did and we ordered similar to our last visit which was good when it arrived  hot  fresh and ample portions  we had a pudding and I ordered coffee at the same time asking if this was OK or should I order after our pudding  the answer from the waitress was I will do it now  no problem  we waited ages after finishing our pudding for the plates to be cleared and hoped that would spark the coffee order  it didn t so after  minutes I reminded the lad who was serving  after another  minutes we got up went to the bar to pay and leave to be asked is everything alright so I explained I had asked twice for coffee to which the lad answered back saying I only asked him once  yes but overall I asked twice and it never came  he said he had put it through as the st time it didn t go   so why didn t we ever get it  I asked to make sure I hadn t been charged and they removed it from the bill and said  sorry  but never offered to get them quickly now and on the house for waiting  no  too busy clearing tables to get more paying customers in  it did spoil the whole visit which was going well until that point  As this was to be a special treat I was very upset   I too agree with the comments about dogs at the tables  OK have them in but put them all in a segregated area away from other people who don t like animals around their food  
neutral;Ate here for a retirement party  just not my cup of tea if I m honest  Did not like how the place come alive and the workers literally pull you up to dance 
neutral; Lacks the ambiance of coffee houses I have visited before  Has a buzz about the place but due to the siting of the tables around a stairwell it loses points  Staff friendly and chatty with customers so can t fault them at all   I was served quickly   not sure how quickly this would be at weekends if only  members of staff are on duty  Sadly my choice of refreshment looked delicious   hot chocolate and an almond croissant   I was asked if I want the croissant heated  good staff training there  however  the conclusion of the croissant on my first bite was to find it on the slight stale side  Disappointed but edible  Hot chocolate okay served with that fancy curl pattern on the top that we all expect to find on top of our coffee shop refreshments these days  Would I go back   yes if I was need of a quick caffeine fix but if I wanted to experience the whole package of a refreshment and the coffee shop experience I m sure Hull has much more to offer  
neutral; Great range of food and taste of dishes was great  However despite advertising themselves as a tapas restaurant it is not really what you would consider tapas  they do not offer a range of  snacks or appetisers   more like a range of very large starter dishes  They do state they have  English portion sizes  what they actually mean is that they sell Spanish food however as with traditional tapas you are not able to try a variety of dishes as one dish is sufficient to fill the average person up    Also after clearly over ordering for our group size    we wanted to take the food we had paid for home and were told they only had plastic bags  oh but we could take the olives   So much food went to waste we were so disappointed  A suggestion would be to predict that people will generally over order due to you advertising as a tapas restaurant and have containers available so people are able to take away what they don t eat but have paid for   Apart from that  service   quality of food was good  Atmosphere was abit stale for a weekend but maybe it was just a quiet night  Just be warned not to expect to be able to try lots of little dishes as the portions are huge  which I m sure is great for those who are fussy and only want to try one or two dishes at a push  or for those that have an endless appetite  but i felt that this place is not really in the traditional spirit of tapas  
neutral; Have been to this restaurant on a number of occasions but unfortunately it is not as good as it was  Food is bland and quite expensive for what it is  They need to get back to basics  
neutral; We had a girls Christmas lunch at Ting  The views are amazing and decor lovely but our table for six was a very obscured view even on a lovely day However mist of us had the festive menu and the Turkey was very average and a bit basic  The service however is not what I expect in a Shangri La it was slow and inattentive missing many opportunities to serve more wine and I continually had to ask for water re fills  The bill took ages and we asked for service to be removed from the tea and coffee bill which was separate as it took a painfully long time  In fact they seemed quite disorganised  Would love to visit the Gong bar but think I will go back to OBlix next time for the same sort of money it s miles better  
neutral; Had to wait  minutes for a drink in the bar area before we went to the restaurant for our table  The bat was almost empty  except maybe  or  tables of   people  The waitress was also short and grumpy when I asked where our drinks were after  minutes   When we went through to the restaurant  the heating was apparently broken  We are our dinner in our coats and we re still feeling cold   We was visiting using the groupon voucher   the food was nice  The spring rolls for starters were the best choice we found  And then I ordered the vegetable yellow curry which was also nice   We didn t enjoy our desserts really either but the mains and starters made up for it   The table service was really slow  again  very empty  Less than   full restaurant   lots of staff standing around but no one nearby when you needed them  We waited  minutes for the bill after asking   All in all   food is nice   but service is poor for what is considered a nice restaurant in London  Maybe the treated us badly because we had groupon vouchers  but don t think that s acceptable really  
neutral; Came between Christmas and new year  The pub  food and staff all had a tired feeling about them  Must be hard to keep going after Christmas but it was open so should have been better  will try again another time  
neutral; the place itself is lovely but i think it is to expensive   if u have a family u r talking a lot of money  if frank brought the price down he would get more off peak times in after all its newbiggin x 
neutral; Upon arriving at the terminal we decided to try the Heston nitro ice cream at the perfectionist cafe  We were quick to be seated but it took longer to receive our order of one ice cream and a glass of wine than it did to drink it the wine  The restaurant was not busy and service was slow  inattentive and with an added service charge to our bill  Not really the proof of their motto  fantastic food fast   We were not the only clients feeling this way as we overheard other clients comments of how long the service was taking  In fairness the ice cream was good  but not extraordinary  and when requested the service charge was removed without comment  In summary a nice environment but very slow service  
neutral; Ordered takeout from here and got beef massaman with sticky rice and a mixed starter for two  To say the starter was just under   i think it is incredibly overpriced and not at all worth it  The curry was really tasty and very generous portions of beef but unfortunately it was really dry which ruined it for me   It hasn t put me off completely  but I am left a little disappointed  
neutral; A bit of a shame really the attitude of one member of staff today tutted rudely when my daughter got stuck in her wheelchair and we had to ask someone to move  How awful considering the other customer was ok about it as he she could see she was actually stuck    Apart from that the food was fine much the same as other Chinese  eat all you like restaurants   Although they did have a Sunday dinner option which was ok as well  It was very reasonably priced and you get what you pay for The man who was front of house was very polite and accommodating too  
neutral; Went to TGI s last night with my boyfriend  We were told there was a thirty minute wait to be seated and that we should wait in the bar area  On the way to the bar area we walked past an empty table  Bar tender served us quickly but no smile to be seen  We were seated after about  minutes in a corner at one of their cushioned bench type tables  The table was sticky like someone had spilled a drink and done nothing about it  The seat had the same feel to it and the remnants of the last customers meal were also scattered about  The knives were DIRTY  featuring watermarks  fingerprints and food  as if they had merely been dipped in water before being returned to the table   The waiter was a nice lad but somewhat bad at his job  He asked if he could start us with drinks despite the fact that I was sipping from mine when he came over  He took our order  my boyfriend ordered garlic bread WITHOUT cheese to start  and then asked if we would like any extras such as onion rings  we said yes and he wrote it down  He came back about ten minutes later with our starters  my boyfriends garlic bread covered in cheese and ran off before we had a chance to mention it  also without asking if we would like more drinks now that our glasses were clearly empty and perched on the edge of the table  I went to the ladies and it was not good  The cubicles were dusty  the floor was dirty  the sink and taps were grimy   Came back to my dinner on the table  no onion rings in sight  However veggie burger  fries and dip were all really good  He finally came back when we were around halfway through our meal and asked if we would like more to drink  Finished meal  took him fifteen minutes to come clear plates and offer us dessert menus  Came back ten minutes later and we ordered  Twenty minutes later we still had no dessert  at which point he came back and said  quot have you not had your desserts yet  quot  and left again  Another five minutes later someone else came and dumped desserts on table   Would go again but would like to have a better  speedier experience next time  
neutral; I was searching online for a place to have a late breakfast midweek in Soho with some friends  and came across numerous recommendations for Gail s  We arrived at about : and the relatively small cafe with a communal seating arrangement was relatively busy  The three of us sat at a table at the back and were asked to order at the till  The two members of staff were lovely and very friendly  although noticeably rushed off their feet  I asked the bircher muesli  which I was told wasn t available that day  so was instead recommended the granola with Greek yogurt and blueberry compote  which I then ordered along with a cappuccino  The granola dish was a little pricey at    but a generous portion and tasty  but nothing amazing  My friends were not overwhelmed with their breakfast orders either  scrambled eggs on toast and french toast  and also found them to be quite expensive for what they were  and we all agreed Gail s would not be our regular breakfast haunt with so much else to offer in the Soho area  However  the interior of the cafe is very light  bright and chic  as well as there being numerous delicious looking baked goods artfully presented around the entrance  I would say it s a nice venue to sit and have a coffee during the day  but not somewhere to stop and have a special breakfast  
neutral; We visited here whilst out on a shopping trip  just my husband and I  The menu was very typical of this type of restaurant  pizza  pasta  steaks and burgers   just what we like  What was surprising was the price of the items   I m more than happy to pay good money for good food but I do think for the food here  it was very over priced    The food itself was lovely  but nothing special  The service and atmosphere were both great  we couldn t fault them    This said  I think given the other choices in this area  we wouldn t rush back here in a hurry  
neutral; I love this place for meetings and the fact we can take the dog and eat too  It s on my doorstep so no need to drive  
neutral; We went for lunch with a groupon voucher which stated  courses with a glass of wine  We decided we fancied a pudding that day We arrived to find no Staff anywhere so sat ourselves down in an almost empty pub and decided what we would like  then a lady turned up and took the order  no conversation not even about the weather which was foul The service was slow but the food was good  we both enjoyed it then came pudding  quot do you want a spoon  quot    then we were presented with a soup spoon each  The girl had disappeared so spoons dont affect the taste  we carried on  again the food was delicious  We saw two staff members while we were there neither of whom had a smile on their face or wanted to talk  So if you want good food give it a try  If you want to feel welcome and a good atmosphere maybe not  
neutral; I went there with my friend and my son Food was good although pricey for what you ate  The staff were very impolite and over the head make sure that you ate as quickly as possible  the Manager is very arrogant and opinionated has no idea on customer service at all  
neutral; All I can say is I had a pretty mediocre dining experience  the food wasn t inedible but at the same time not that great  The service was ok but given the choice  I wouldn t be sure if I would go back  
neutral; The Haunch of Venison is an extremely old pub in the center of Salisbury  we popped in for a drink and were please to find a good selection of hand pull beers on offer  The pub is tiny and on several different levels so may not be suitable for anyone with walking difficulties gt  i would not describe it as comfortable but it has a great feel of times gone by  definitely worth a visit  
neutral;Visited at lunch time on th April with my sisters  We got seated really quickly and drinks offered as soon as we took a seat  they came rapidly   When taking the order the waiters   didn t take her name  was crouching down to talk to us  I didn t like that it felt like I was a child being told off or something   The menu was good  great selection and great value   I had tomato bruschetta when it came it was swamped in balsamic vinegar   I didn t complain I could have asked for it separate but I never   Once over the taste of vinegar it was actually quite nice and rather filling for a starter  Once we had all finished they cleaned the plates and got refills for drinks   Mains come really quickly  I had chicken BLT which looked extremely appealing and was very tasty  I didn t finish it as I was so full from the starter   My sister had a hot dog which she said was nice the only critic I have from that meal  was that it didn t look to appealing it came out in a basket  but the hotdog was just spilling over she would have preferred it on a plate but that s personal preference    The atmosphere was a bit hit and miss  The music was quite loud for a Monday afternoon  also once we paid the bill my sister visited the toilet and came out as soon as she went in the toilets were flooded   Overall it s not too bad just a few teething problems  I have been to other TGI FRIDAYS and had better experiences
neutral; We were a group of + who went for a Christmas lunch the week before Christmas  We were seated in the conservatory which was very  very cold  A number of us asked for the heating to be out on but this never happened   We all enjoyed our meal but the starters took too long to arrive  the lunch itself was enjoyed by all but the desserts again took too long to arrive and no one could understand how the Christmas pudding sauce could taste and look like custard even though we questioned this  The coffee came without the milk cream sugar  by the time this arrived the coffee was cold   By  o clock the restaurant was quite so the problems were just that they had booked in too many people and could not cope with the rush  This was a shame as the carvery  as usual was great  
neutral; I booked Fire   Stone in Covent Garden for our work Christmas lunch for  people    We were going to eat off the Christmas Menu but discovered this was exactly the same as the normal menu but cost about % more    At pm the venue was quite lifeless and lacking an atmosphere  The food was average and nothing special  Maybe even a bit tasteless    The staff were ok but when we asked to split the bill they weren t able to   were far from helpful not even offering a pen to help with the calculation  
neutral;We went here based on the reviews on trip advisor  We had a nice meal and the food was nice too  I would say its not as great as hyped up on here  I ordered a lemonade and it tasted awful but they did knock this off the bill when we told them about it  We did feel a bit rushed as it was very busy but staff were friendly 
neutral; While the food looked fresh and made on site  my dish was bland and overpriced  I opted not to have the one vegetarian option of quiche and instead had a plate of mixed salads as suggested by the server  I was shocked that these   scoops  came to    costing more than the main dishes on offer  and the lady on the till was unhelpful and rude when I queried this  As fresh as the salads were  they had no dressing to note or seasoning other than some basil leaves with the tomatoes  and certainly not enough substance to warrant the   price  There were also no free tables as most had been reserved  The gardens are beautiful though and well worth a visit  
neutral; We had a takeaway for the first time last night  although they advertise they do a local delivery  we had to collect it ourselves   We had the mussels for starter which were very rubbery and overcooked  also the Kingfish in the curry was also overcooked and dry   tasted as though it had been cooked a couple of days ago  Having said that  the beetroot dish  veggie curry  and tarka dhal were all excellent  We will definitely try another takeaway or eat in  but will stick to the veggie dishes as they were delicious and very good value  whereas the fish dishes were expensive and not worth it  
neutral; Visited with a friend for a meal out on a Friday evening  Restaurant was busy but service and food was fine  Wouldn t be my first choice for a meal out but would happily go again  
neutral; For this visit there was a group of  of us we were seated upstairs on a table near the kitchen  Everytime a server would walk past the whole floor would shake including our chairs table and cutlery  After a whilst of being seated this started to become very uncomfortable and irritating  We had the mothers day menu and a children s menu  The options for children s starters were very limited  She had goats cheese soup with bread  chicken and bacon pie and ice cream for dessert  All of which she disliked except for the ice cream  The soup was not suitable for a children s menu as goats cheese is an acquired taste for many people let alone children and the only other option is prawns  For our starter we had the duck terrine which was average for the main we had ribs which had hardly any meat on although presentation was nice  And the eton mess dessert was lovely  It was hard to relax and enjoy our meals as it was a very noisy  busy environment  there is nothing worse than people running past your table every  minutes to and from the kitchen causing us to feel as though we were on vibrating chairs  After receiving the bill we were also greeted with another lovely surprise of a % service charge  An extra   on top of our already nearly   bill  We were absolutely gobsmacked that after the amount we were already paying to dine we then had to pay for the service  Should it not be a preference to tip if you so wish which we did want to until we were greeted with that nasty surprise  Good job we brought extra cash to be able to pay it as we only brought with us what we thought we would need  Due to the food only being average and the dining table location being an awkward one along with the extra cost we will not be returning to browns again  Which is a shame as we dine out a lot and are more than willing to pay good money for a good restaurant  
neutral; Have been on numerous occasions its like every other chain pub  cheap booze  edible food  Filled with people of all ages   Dont go in there on a friday or saturday night if you want a quiet night out  
neutral; We stopped by at the Royal George for lunch and liked the revamp of the bar area  the oak   flagstone styled courtyard with Jamie Oliver branded comfy seating with wood burners in the wrought iron tables  the modern barn style of the rear dining area with big glass doors onto the courtyard  It s nice to see a bar in Thornbury targeting up market and we hope others follow suit  The food is good solid bar food not competing with Romys Indian or La Piazza traditional Italian nearby  and still above average with freshly flame grilled chicken burger and generous squid starter salads  Pleasant staff nice clean feel check it out  
neutral; A disappointing coffee shop   very limited choice when we visited  early afternoon  Things had sold out and not re stocked  Staff not particularly helpful or friendly  Nice to sit in the cloisters though with a view of the beautiful cathedral  
neutral;I am not sure how to review this pub restaurang  We were at the Huntsman for our  years anniversary and we called to book just  days before and it sounded as it was fully booked but it wasn t  and they hadn t reserved the table  we were there early   we didn t get any wine meny  the place is beautiful as many says   nice and clean  decoration is lovely very modern  The food is not as the description  on the meny sounds so lovely   but when it came on the plate it was not as you read it   my lobster was swimming in a sea of crme  the prawn cocktail came as an open sandwich  lots of rocket sallad everywhere  my goat cheese starter was just rocket sallad and goat cheese and rock hard bread   It tasted fine but it was not what we thought  So reviewing this pub is not easy  it all tasted fine but am I going back  I am not sure 
neutral;I went to this restaurant using a Groupon Voucher and thought we were going to get a nice meal at a good price  However  when we arrived we were pressured into buying lots of extras and in the end  it was a very expensive meal  All the other people dining were using the same voucher and were also persuaded to buy extras  I do feel disappointed with my experience and it has definitely put me off returning  The food was OK but not great for the price  The staff were friendly although that was probably because they wanted you to buy all the extras 
neutral; Food was good but interior needs updating  Staff very friendly  Main lounge area was a bit like an old working mans club not a pub  
neutral; I didn t like the food but that was personal taste  we asked if there was a dish that was cooked and was presented with  cooked prawns in rice and rolled in what looked like duct tape  I would imagine the taste was the same  For what you got  it was very expensive  The drink situation was a shambles  if we hadnt been warned to get our drinks before we entered the restaurant  I doubt we would have got them before the end of the meal  like various other diners that were complaining  
neutral; This is at the top end of fleetwood near the beach   Was a very busy coffee shop cramped with lots of tables and chairs together   Ordered afternoon tea and had none left   No teacakes   Not much of light snacks so had apple pie which was a small portion  very dry   Overall not very good   Staff were friendly  although didnt have staff at door to greet customers as a few left   
neutral;I went to this restaurant with two friends  The waitress could not have been more helpful or welcoming  However we had to wait far too long before our food arrived  It was delicious  but portion sizes were ridiculously small 
neutral; Visited on a Monday after a busy weekend in Margate  not as good as normal  My lamb dish was another meat I did not recognise  my friends dish should have been duck but it was the same as mine   friend at the other end of the table gave her dinner away I would rather have been informed if some of the dishes were not available   not deceived  
neutral; Been here several times  and food is ok  Don t expect fresh italian food for the money  Service is ok  again nothing special by any means Few dishes are ok   antipasto bruschetta fish  rest is frozen and reheated  Restaurant is large and comfortable  although busy with families and parties at the weekend  
neutral; Downside first  We have visited this pub many times and is popular with locals and some visitors don t like this    not a problem as far as I m concerned  they live there so visitors should respect that  That said when a person becomes loud and raucous and that impacts on your experience  it s not so good  On the plus side they have a good choice of beers and cider  there s a varied menu at decent prices  most of which is nice  while some is typical pub food so I d recommend trying the specials    
neutral; Went here for lunch on a Saturday  Went inside ordered drinks and grabbed some menus had a flick through and went back inside to order and find a table to eat at  Ordered a selection of food to nibble on and it was served pretty quickly  The nachos are not to my liking the chips were too soft and not enough toppings on top also no which for me is a must for nachos  The garlic peri peri chicken wings aren t very spicy and have more of a lemony taste to them but we re really yummy  The menu looked nice but I doubt I would come here for an evening meal  Just not quite my liking   The price is a bit much for a pub lunch  I doubt I d eat here again  But I do like variety and there are a few watering holes around that do nicer food   Lovely little pub if your in the area and if the weather was better outside dining would be lovely  
neutral; Not bad  staff were good but food just typical pub grub type food and not bad  Atmosphere not great  Haven t been back and unlikely to do so  
neutral;As many others trip advisors we decided to try this restaurant due to the rave reviews   being no   so booked well in advance and packed kids off to friends for the night  Yes  the decor and ambiance is well pitched  a little bohemian  which Brighton is  and of course Giorgio front of house  very welcoming  However I would of liked to have been offered an aperitif  had been looking forward to a prosecco  to peruse my menu over and to try the lovely fresh  but slightly undersized  amuse bouche   especially as we were assured we had the table for the night to ourselves so no rush  The paper napkin was a shame as the rest of the table oozed decadence  with silver candelabra and menu holder  We tried both starters  rice balls  and stuffed aubergine  but was sort of thing I d make at home for friends  Main course lacked enough seasoning  but Giorgio did supply condiments without us having to embarrassingly ask  The lasagna traditional was tasty  but not out of this world  the braciole  seemed overwhelmed with bread and very little meat  also would have like to have seen another vegetable to accompany  we were served a few saute peppers  Finally the tiramisu dessert lacked a punch  think the booze had been omitted   It was nice home cooked food  which can only assume was cooked by a home cook and not a trained chef  The ingredients seemed bulked out with cheaper stuff  which I can guess would be the way they do it in Sicily old times  but restaurants claiming excellence need to step up the good stuff  Left here feeling like I could eat more  If I were to go to the same price  area  restaurant again for a special occasion I would go to Fig tree in Hurstpierpoint which really did have me talking about it for days  would keep this place for another day   
neutral; We came here as a group  and it was recommended by a friend who had been here some time ago  The service was ok  starter portion was tiny  the food was ok nothing to shout about  I felt the price did not reflect the quality and taste of the food  I have tasted much better Italian food at a much cheaper price  I definitely would not be returning  
neutral; Yes this pub serves good food but if you lived adjacent it s not so inviting when you have groups of drunks fighting and arguing along Winchester Drive  more so when turning out time is midnight and some of them sit outside the pub to all hours  Good luck to Rob and Rennata who must be coining it  but please have some thought for the elderly residents who live locally  
neutral; I ve been here a few times since it changed hands   the pizzas are still very good  and I love sitting at the table near the pizza oven so you can see what s happening   Other dishes  gnocchi with a very dry ragu  have been less reliable  and the service a little defensive when one complains  This is the only Italian restaurant in Sandwich   think they need some competition    
neutral; Average bar in London for cocktails but with an expensive London price tag  the range was quite limited  Some of the cocktails had very unusual ingredients and the waiter was no help in explaining what they were  which made selecting one quite difficult  We sat outside initially but it was incredibly noisy being on the strand  and the bagpipes being played by a busker drove us a bit nutz  so we ventured inside where there was no atmosphere or buzz   A friend had recommended here but won t be visiting again  
neutral; This restaurant is HUGE  sprawling over about three levels  I m not quite sure why it s called The Cosy Club because there s nothing very intimate or cosy about it  but it is nice  Very well decorated with lots of interesting features    Our food took quite a while to arrive  but I wasn t surprises  given how packed it was  The food is good  although some dishes are better than others  My daughter s kids  macaroni was fantastic   probably the best macaroni  let alone kids  macaroni  I ve seen  It was very tasty  with a crunchy topping and a generous serving  My husband and I had a vegetarian thai style burger that was just alright and lacked taste somewhat  There was nothing especially Thai about it  The eggs royale was very good  but it s hard to get something like that wrong really  All in all a pleasant meal  but nothing outstanding  
neutral;Food arrived and all chips went back as stone cold  Service terrible  tables not cleared and long wait between courses   My burger was lovely though 
neutral;We booked lunch here on a recent visit to see our daughter who is at university in Lincoln  Apparently she d eaten here before and thought it was good so I suppose I was probably expecting great things  It was very busy when we arrived which I always take as a good sign  The interior though is very dark and worn  Unfortunately  however  because all orders have to be placed at the bar  it was a good  minutes before we were able to actually inform someone that we d arrived and then we were redirected to the light and airy restaurant upstairs  which was worryingly quiet   ourselves and another party of   people only  Mind you  the service was nice and quick and we were soon seated with drinks and perusing the menu  However  again  alarm bells started ringing because it s so vast   and specials on top  I chose grilled goats  cheese to start followed by chilli con carne  My daughter chose the pate and pork belly  My husband chose the tempura battered prawns and pork belly  both meals looked great and were delicious  apparently  The goats  cheese was also lovely and well presented  unfortunately  the chilli wasn t   there were all sorts of additions to it that suggested it had  perhaps started life as something else   peppers  black beans  tomato sauce   but very few kidney beans and virtually no spice  or flavour   It was also supposed to come with sour cream but there was very little of it  Not to be discouraged  my daughter and I both ordered the rice pudding for dessert  However  again  this was a very disappointing dish   really stodgy and difficult to eat   though  once more  my daughter liked it and so  as I like to think I ve brought her up to be discerning about her food  it clearly comes down to personal preference  I wouldn t have said that  overall  the restaurant is expensive but  certainly  my meal was over priced for the quality received  I won t be eating here again although I suspect my family wouldn t mind going for a second time 
neutral; We went for lunch with kids   it was so awful the waiter was rushing here and there without finishing an order we were waited there nearly hour to get food he was very unfriendly   unorganised at last he made us waited half an hour for our bill so disgusting 
neutral; Tgi Fridays is one of my children s favourite restaurant so really glad we have one now in Brighton  Food good as always although the the wait time is awful we have been twice in three weeks and both time waited way too long  On our second visit we waited  minutes then asked if someone could serve us drinks  We finally got our meals hour and minutes after arrival and the restaurant was less than half full  Deffinatly need to speed up the service and then would be as good as the many other TGI Fridays we have been to  
neutral; been there with a friend  the food was really sweet even i asked spicy curry  the restaurnt is really hot  think they might need air con or something  
neutral; Usual choice of food but on the night we were there they had a power cut and the service was really quite slow  And whilst it won t bother some people we didn t appreciate other peoples  children scooting  yes  on a scooter  and running round our table  they nearly tripped the staff up on several occasions  The food was good when we got it but not the best atmosphere and the staff looked fed up  
neutral; meals all taste the same no real difference in the medium selection and the mild cream sauces all taste the same 
neutral;Visited yesterday on a fabulous September day and sat outside in the courtyard at the back of the newly refurbished restaurant  We were able to order quickly as it wasn t busy and we both opted for the goat s cheese and spinach quiche  deli salad and deli salad leaves for    each  Service was quick and polite  The quiche was well seasoned and hot and the portion size was acceptable but the deli salad consisted of slightly underdone new potatoes  some cut in halves  some whole  absolutely smothered in mayonnaise and chives and the leaves were just that with a bit of salad dressing  For the amount charged  the dish was average and amateur both in appearance and taste and as I parted with    I felt slightly cheated  I have been to the cafe before and have not been particularly impressed with the food which should be top notch in a place calling itself the Food Centre  The shop is great and can t fault the presentation of goods on offer but the restaurant cafe mustn t rest on those laurels 
neutral; My husband decided we would go here for lunch on a whim and I wasn t disappointed  The food was lovely even though we both agreed slightly overpriced for a lunch time menu  however we would be more than happy to pay that for an evening meal  Perhaps the lunch and dinner menu are the same  Would be even nicer if it was licensed to sell alcohol  Food  presentation and service were all good  
neutral; Off hand service let down what was otherwise a nice meal  The atmosphere and decor is lovely and the cooking good but our experience was spoiled by a waitress who did the minimum  To be fair  we hadn t booked but had arrived early and were told there was space for us   people   We enjoyed our meal despite having to extract information about the menu via careful questioning  us: what do the specials come with  waitress: potatoes and vegetable  us: what sort of potatoes and vegetables  waitress: whatever you like   We hadn t been told that our table was needed at a certain time so were surprised when the bill appeared on the table as the pudding dishes were cleared away  just  minutes after we d arrived  The bill included a % service charge  too  
neutral; Menu limited to light snack sandwich menu  Tasted nice and nicely presented  Cosy bistro with nice decor  We each had a cake but both were a little dry  
neutral; Interesting veggie food   but very heavy stodgy and expensive  Not a good atmosphere   rather formal and dull  
neutral; Its a lovely looking restaurant but for quality and quantity i think its slightly too expensive    I wouldn t return unless i was invited by someone else  It wouldn t be my first choice of restaurant purely on price  I can t fault the service or the food as both were good  but there are restaurants with the same quality of food and service but the value for money at other restaurants is a lot better    Sorry Miller   Carter   maybe a review of prices would be beneficial  
neutral; I recommended this restaurant to my husband when it first opened as it was lovely and great value for money  We eventually made it and what a disappointment  It s really gone downhill since then  We were so disappointed and it s unlikely that we ll come back as there are so much nicer Chinese Buffets  
neutral; We visited today after watching a show  It was very busy but we were quickly seated  Good range of food choices  We personally found it to be expensive and not value for money 
neutral; The restaurant looked great  the pianist playing was a real plus to the meal but he unfortunately didn t play for long and once the restaurant filled up we couldn t hear each other well  we are in our  s  no hearing aids necessary yet    The host was really charming but the waiters wouldn t crack a smile  The service was quick but the food was average  
neutral; Nice place with a lot of potential it isn t cosy it needs a bit of atmosphere  I have only been there for coffee or lunch I don t know what it looks like in the evenings  However the staff are nice and the owner is very pleasant and always happy to chat to customers  
neutral; Food adverage but quite expensive service ok  Would go back but not in a hurry as didnt think it was value for money  
neutral; Considering there are a lot of Italian restaurants to choose from we think that  quot Jamie quot  could do better than this  The food was ok   cant really complain about it but was not blown away  
neutral; We went several years ago  It has recently been refurbished Big improvement Howeverthe food was disappointing  I asked for medium spice It was like eating a pudding  The tables were a bit close together too  The music was pleasant but a bit loud  
neutral; Went for a meal with my parents last night  and although it was lovely I have to say there were just a couple of niggles that could have been a little better  For starters the staff  only two of them could have possibly been a little happier  I think I saw maybe two smiles the whole night  they were lovely but didn t seem overly happy to be there  Also with dessert  my mums tiramisu tasted fine  yet mine was a little watery at the bottom  the top was fine but the bottom  it was almost as if it had been taken out a freezer   That being said the set price menu is great  the soup was fine and the mains were fantastic  my mums lasagne was the best ever and my penne salmone was lovely just a little bit too much and I did end up leaving a little  
neutral; Ate there and would rate it as ok but not worth the money  Eaten exactly the same thing at York and ten times better I m afraid  Was dissappointed as expected the same  BUT I would like to say that the lady serving behind the counter at about  am was very friendly and very polite  
neutral; I had the  course set menu which was reasonably priced at    A cocktail was also included  I had the onion soup starter which was too sweet and creamy  The chicken for the main which was quite dry and the sticky toffee pudding which was the highlight of the meal  The venue was stunning and cannot be faulted at all  Overall the food was average apart from the dessert but the setting makes up for it  
neutral; I didn t notice it was a Wetherspoons until it was too late  The fact that it is a Wetherspoons should say it all  cheap and very average  the fact that it is so affordable will just attract the people you think it will  You will find guys drinking beer from early hours and loads of kids running around wild  no it is not cute  watch your kids people Long queue and slow service but it is clean    I had tried the chicken breast burger  my bad  It was dry and horrible  no seasoning whatsoever  it was literally just a piece of chicken breast in a bun Don t bother ordering anything unusual  The Sunday roast is bland  order something easy to cook so they can t mess it up  preferably something deep fried fried  
neutral; I do not usually write negative reviews   do feel bad doing so but in all honesty was really quite disappointed with this restaurant My husband has been wanting to go for ages   we went on a Friday lunchtime  the restaurant was quite busy  mainly an elderly clientele  The waitress who served us was lovely   really helpful   However I was really disappointed with the food  I would be tempted to give it a poor but know I am a fussy eater  I had the chicken parfait which was really not very nice   left an aftertaste   repeated on me for the rest of the day  My husband had the goats cheese bruschetta which was actually a pastry based goats cheese tart on arrival which he said was bland but pleasant enough  For mains I had the chicken caesar salad   the dressing wasn t a Caesar dressing  the bacon was burnt  the croutons were so greasy oil ran down the back of your throat when you ate them  the chicken was cooked ok but again greasy  We also ordered a side of creamed garlic courgettes   I was interested expecting a mash purÇ¸e of courgettes instead we were given a bowl of grilled courgettes sliced with lots of cream poured on top  Not what I expected at all  Again they were greasy   claggy with all the cream on top   we left them  I didn t complain as the waitress was so nice   we were eating the reasonable   for  courses  I would def be complaining if I d been paying evening prices   Overall really can t see why this restaurant has so many fantastic reviews will not be visiting again 
neutral;Much better since its recent renovation  Food and drink a bit on the pricy side  Great service from friendly staff 
neutral; The dÇ¸cor and ambience feels a bit late s B B  The food was ok but it feels a bit like it s a sideline or a family run affair where they don t strive for any kind of excellence ie  service was slow at the bar and on ordering  everything we ordered came with vegetable crisps piled on top and our bottle of wine was opened out of sight  There s nowhere else within walking distance to eat so it was just ok to get a bite to eat  The staff were very friendly though  
neutral;Booked a table and had to wait for one to become available  We ordered drinks and they took ages to arrive   if that was not bad enough we finally managed to get someone to take our food order and this took even longer to arrive  To be fare  once the food did eventually arrive it was generally Ok  but some of the chicken was over done and chewy  Took ages for us to get the bill  To cap it all the toilets were disgusting  Just on this point alone I would think twice about going back to this restaurant again 
neutral; We called into this Wetherspoons on early Saturday evening for a meal after finding the other Wetherspoons on the harbour very busy indeed  It is a little dark and I was surprised to hear music but we found the staff very helpful and courteous and our meals soon arrived but unfortunately there was a slight mix up and I didn t get the meal I ordered  After bringing this to their attention I d like to say that Anthony  Manager   was very attentive and took our issue very seriously and resolved it to our satisfaction  I was impressed by his level of customer service and wanted to note that here  Yes I d return and I believe there is a nice sun terrace there too but we didn t find it on this visit  
neutral; We ordered a takeaway   picked it up and when we got home found that we were missing a starter  poppadoms and pickles  not happy  The food we did get was very tasty but we felt disappointed with the service  
neutral; In general food ok and not having to wait very long  The smell od toilets really puts you off  sort it out  The look od the toilets isnt the worst although the smell od it is extremely bad  You can even smell it on the stairs  Two waitresess very attentive and one guy not really  Also the butter served with a bread very hard  could be softened a bit before serving  
neutral; Ribs n Bibs has such a nice atmosphere  on Lincoln s Steep Hill  it has an old American western atmosphere in an old fashioned quirky building to match  We went with a group of  on a Thursday night and it was not busy but I think it is always safest to book if you are in quite a big group  Expect to pay   and more for a burger and chips  Burgers are really nice hand made  but the chips say  skin on  and they aren t they are just like frozen chips  Portions aren t huge either  My friend got the ribs which were    so about the same price as you d pay for them at TGIFridays  However  portions at TGIs are much better  Nice ribs though  Dessert was the best thing   I recommend the waffle sandwich  The peanut butter ice cream in it is to die for  And the portion size was huge  So over all mixed feelings and a tad on the expensive side for what you get  
neutral; I had no problems with the food it was perfectly OK   acceptable  but not exceptional  however service was slow  it was not a particularly busy night   not particularly friendly nor helpful  no one seemed in a rush   quite the opposite to a point where you were made to feel like you were bothering the staff by asking for something or reminding them that something you requested had not arrived   they were not really on the ball but what do you expect when % service charge is automatically added to your bill   there is no incentive for the staff to be polite  helpful  friendly  efficient    front of house letting down the back of house unfortunately  
neutral; We visited on Monday night  having been given a selection of menus from local restaurants by the hotel we were staying at  and liking the look of the menu  Thankfully  the food and atmosphere saved our visit  as the service was very poor  The place was fairly busy for a Monday night which gave a nice chilled out atmosphere  However  we were passed our menus as we were walking to our table rather than when we were seated  we were left to find our own way to the table  just pointed in the vague direction of the window   We were left alone for at least   minutes before the waiter came to say hello and take our order  hadn t been offered anything drink    we were in no rush and could have happily forgiven any wait but no  sorry about the wait  or explanation was offered   to be honest the waiter was rather miserable  he clearly did not want to be there  We then waited at least a further   minutes for our first drink to arrive   when it did it was wrong  vodka and coke rather than lemonade  and the bottle of still water I ordered simply never arrived  Upon asking another waiter later on  we were given a jug of water   the glass jug was really badly chipped all around the lip   not very safe or appealing  The second waiter was a lot more energetic and it has to be said  did seem a lot friendlier   Thankfully  the food was good when it arrived  steak was delicious   The disinterest of the servers really did let it down   no check back was done and we weren t offered another drink  so we left and went elsewhere for drinks afterwards  We would have spent more on drinks had we been given the opportunity  We just weren t made to feel very welcome or looked after which was a shame as it is a nice place and the food was good  
neutral; We have had a very mixed experience of the Art House as have many we speak to  We decided to give it another chance and were pleased that the service had improved  However the waitresses need training and stop calling everyone  quot guys quot  On previous visits we had had slow service and despite having booked were given a table at the back on our own which was not a good space   We have given the Art House another chance and hope that they can get a consistent standard of service as the food is good  
neutral; I asked which vegetarian option they had for lunch  The answer was  salmon salad  or  tuna and sweetcorn   I opted for a jacket potato with beans which really was the only option for me  That was  A peppermint tea was  The jacket was microwaved  The peppermint tea was an ordinary bag  
neutral; A warm welcome and shown to our table  as we were waiting for others we were offered something but declined wishing to wait for the rest of the party  Once everyone had arrived it appeared there was a mix up as we waited over half an hour for orders to be taken  We had chosen the cream tea option and it was well presented and we were charmed by the vintage style of the crockery   which we found to be clean   Portions were small   not being a cream tea aficionado I cannot say how this compares  most notably the portion of jam was miniscule for the number of scones it was to be spread over  I will say that when asked more was provided  as were top up drinks  I think the sour note was one member of staff whose comments veered from polite to fairly politically incorrect   which did affect the experience   Would I return  Just a maybe  
neutral; Had a Groupon voucher so can t complain about the cost of our  courses and bottle of prosecco  there was a limited menu but we were happy with the choices  I had steak which was ok but nothing exciting  Hubby had belly pork which was very nice  SautÇ¸ potatoes were not great  Staff were nice and friendly  
neutral; This was our second visit to this restaurant   it has now become a BYO  This means  you bring your own alcohol but they do serve soft drinks  There is a sign on the door that says you can only have your table for two hours  We thought that this would be ample time to eat but not so  has soon has we ordered we felt the staff were rushing us after each course to finish  We do like a small break after each course  The staff were very abrupt almost to the point of being rude  rush  rush  rush not a great way to spend a saturday evening with friends  Considering they no longer had a license to sell alcohol  could not understand the justifaication of putting up their prices either  Wont be rushing back there  although the food was good  
neutral; Came here for Sunday lunch during a recent stay in the area  Thankfully we arrived just before the rush and didn t have to queue at the carvery for too long to get our food  However there were no roast potatoes available  so had mash instead  Soon after there was a huge queue  so going back to see if the roasties were now available wasn t an option  without being excused of pushing in  They were very busy  and I had to attract the waiter s attention to get the bill and leave  
neutral; I really do like Indian but slightly disapointed in the fact that the curry was too mild for a Tikka  it was ok not a lot of flavour though and for the cost of meal  really felt like i didn t get a lot for the money  Customer service was good and a good atmosphere  I would return again though only to try another dish  hopefully that will be spicier and much better  
neutral; Both our starters were beautifully prepared and generous portions  both our main dishes were just ok  it was as if all the effort had gone into the starters  The service was also just ok  food and drink delivered promptly but no real effort made by the waiter who looked bored and a bit grumpy  
neutral;Tables were dirty and sticky  staff were friendly but it was obviously understaffed  The salad bowls were dirty as was the cutlery putting you off before you even received your meals  the salad choice was ok  My meal was adequate but my family s orders were either wrong or Luke warm  Was disappointed 
neutral;we arrived to an already full tearoom for Sunday breakfast we managed to squeeze ourselves into a corner and waited  and waited  our arrival wasn t even acknowledge so after half an hour we got up and left  I m afraid for us to not return it would only have taken a waitress to say I m sorry we re busy but will be with you shortly but we received nothing 
neutral; My friend and I were very much looking forward to our brunch at Christopher s this past weekend  The food was quite nice and fairly priced for the ambient environment and central city location  Unfortunately the experience was let down by mixed service  Upon arriving at :  we were asked to wait in the bar until the restaurant officially opened at :  Whilst that was entirely understandable  we were then completely ignored until I asked if they were ready for us yet   minutes later  The two members of staff at the welcome desk had already forgotten our reservation name and responded with little more than a smirk and a pointed finger up the stairs to the restaurant  The waiters who took our order and served our food were outstanding but as soon as we had finished our meal we were then completely ignored again for at least half an hour  It was very difficult to catch anyone s attention in order to get our bill and subsequently pay  All in all  I won t be returning  
neutral;Came here with a friend for an evening Tapas dinner and cocktails  The restaurant area has a few different areas so it was very quiet and private where we were sitting  The service was average as once we had ordered  we didn t see anybody for at least an hour and had to go and find somebody to request the bill  The food itself was delicious  well cooked and good value for money as the tapas was  dishes for   and the portion sizes were very fair  Thoroughly enjoyed the evening 
neutral; Too loud  too grubby and food no more than average  Spent the whole evening smelling of fried onions  I m too old and grumpy to sit with yelling kids around  blasting rock music meant conversation was at full volume or not at all  The waitress was great   I think she shared our pain  
neutral; So I have been to Shaka Zulu about  times now over a  year period and each time the experience has been completely different   Firstly the detail  decoration and design is amazing  everything carved or embellished from the ceilings to the tables and chairs  But after a few visits that novelty wears off and you begin to pay more attention to the service and food you receive on each visit   If you go on a weekend be prepared for the waiter waitress to be very busy  they are always polite but are clearly under staffed for such a large restaurant  So sometimes you have to wait a while if you need to ask for something   One time the waiter brought me my meal and placed it down so quickly onto the table my stack of four large potato  what I will describe as chips  flew off of the serving board onto the table he quickly scooped them onto the board and ran off to get another meal for me  however I had wanted to ask for Peri Peri Fries instead of the thicker potato stacked fries but he was gone before I had the chance to tell him  More staff on busy nights would give these guys a break and a slightly better service   At the weekends around  O Clock the nightclub music starts to play and things become more lively   this may sound intrusive but if you are out for a fun evening with friends it actually gets you in the mood for the rest of the night  then women with big Zebra Headresses on come out and walk around dancing and letting you take pictures with them which is great fun  I am not sure what time the restaurant closes but I know it becomes a nightclub afterwards on one side of the restaurant  the restaurant is the biggest I have ever been to  so if you want to you can stay and party   I live in London however have friends in Kent we read online about an offer that if you present a Rail Ticket for travel to London  from outside of London not tube tickets  you receive  for  on your main meal  the first time we used that we were chuffed as it took about   off of our bill  depending on what you chose  but each time we tried after that there seemed to be different rules that weren t stipulated anywhere  the second time we were told we needed a rail ticket EACH to get the  for  deal  then third time we was supposedly meant to print off a voucher form from National Rail s website and bring it with us filled in  Very annoying  and rather than be gracious and allow us the deal as a we told them we had used this deal before without a problem we was met with a very irritated and short tempered receptionist who had a  quot well there s nothing I can do about it attitude quot    One time I had to complain about the service and the Manager offered us a free cocktail each we ordered the cocktail for two people which comes in a fun Hyena head shaped goblet which cost   so we left happy  However on my last visit  there seemed to be problem after problem  all minor but added up as the night went on  at the end of the meal I asked to speak to the manager and explained how many things had gone wrong that evening and I almost had to convince them to take the  % service charge off which seemed ridiculous considering service charges although added to your bill anyway are in fact discretionary depending on your service and experience    The food however is undoubtably delicious  Springbok Fillet is amazing for anyone that loves their meat  Peri Peri Fries are lovely  and my favourite starter is the lamb and pea samosa s  which unfortunately aren t always on the menu possibly the menu changes at different periods of the day or season   Well worth a visit despite the above comments because you will undoubtably enjoy the overall experience but maybe not if you go regularly   For  starters   mains  a bottle of wine and  cocktails expect to spend between    You can also sign up for their  Loyalty Card  which gets you % off  Ask the waiter as I have only ever been told about this on one visit and I always bring my card just before I pay the bill so no other staff have ever mentioned it to me since  
neutral; I went here for a meal and a drink but we had only the drink as the menu was a bit samey pub grub and nothing special  The whole place was a bit clinical for my liking and not very homely or comfortable 
neutral; We visited as a family on Sunday and found the place to be quite busy   especially outside  The service wasn t anything special but the menu looked decent  We ordered  tea  a mocha and a Brie  Bacon and Cranberry Baguette with chips and salad to share  The baguettes are on the generous side  It all came quite quickly and was very tasty and certainly very good value if you re sharing  All in all  a pleasant lunch  
neutral; Booked online a couple of weeks in advance  got a table by the window which I had asked for  No gluten free menu  for me  but the girl taking the order was knowledgeable about gluten free options  All  of us opted for a roast dinner   when we first arrived I am sure we were told the roasts were beef or turkey  but on ordering it was beef or pork   we were then told they had ran out of turkey   how can a pub doing lunch from  to  run out of turkey by Two people chose pork   they said this was fine    of us chose beef  The beef was tough  fatty  and grisly  We were given two slices each  the men ate their s  because they are men  the women cut it up into edible bits and left the rest  If I served up this roast beef at home I would be mortified  and to get it in a restaurant  well  it was not good  The veg and gravy were fine  It was    for a roast dinner and a pud  so not overly expensive  The puds were good I was told  but nothing out of the ordinary  The bar and waiting staff were excellent  maybe they could go and work in the kitchen  the dining room was fine  we had a table by the window which I had asked for  Whatever you pay for your meal you expect it to at least have nice meat  The beef supplier needs to be changed because I don t think it would have tasted any better however you cooked it  I don t think I would go out of my way to go again  sorry  it s a shame because mostly we enjoyed it  it was just that beef   
neutral; on a family break and had sausage and chips here It was good especially the chips  would recommend a visit  
neutral; This is the second time I have been here  You basically get what it says on the tin   a good all you can eat buffet  For a    dinner you get a reasonable choice of meats  fish  vegetables and sauces with noodles and rice as well as a selection of desserts  There is also the option of getting some food cooked in front of you  It isn t high end but it fills a hole and is a good value Chinese meal where you can go up as many times as you like   Staff were quite attentive  Especially when it came to clearing your finished plates  
neutral; Booked table for  for  on a Thursday evening  eventually seated around :  We knew that the dining style was Italian Tapas but the waiter spoke so quickly about how you should order we ordered  dishes and wrote them down so that the waiter could simply take it away to the kitchen  He didn t and needless to say we were one meal missing   the Steak dish  I found the portions small eg a chicken dish consisting of  two thighs which we  dissected  into  so we could all sample it  a ravioli dish that had  ravioli   The pizza was a normal size and if we hadn t ordered that you would be hungry   NB I had grapefruit for breakfast and a sandwich for lunch so not a glutton    As it was my fellow diners said they were happy with the meal which is fair as the food is tasty but not enough to share  If the waiter menu stated portion sizes in each dish we could have ordered two of each  As it was I had to order a desert  The atmosphere is good  lively  noisy but the service drops once the majority of your dishes have arrived  So  if I were to dine here again I would come on a full breakfast  It s expensive for a dining drinking experience but a good place to  sample  good Italian food  
neutral; the younger female sports staff like to talk loudly to each other and shriek with laughter which can be very off putting to fat old ladies like me who are trying to keep fit by using the swimming pool  Women should support each other not mock  
neutral; Me and my husband visited the Rummer for Sunday lunch last week  I was really looking forward to it after our last visit a few years back    I was disappointed to say the least  My mushroom tart for starters was quite dry and the chewy beef roast came out with pretty much  raw vegetables    My husband had the lamb  which was cooked perfectly  he didn t mind the undercooked vegetables so I guess it s down to personal preference    Service was excellent  the waiter was very kind and knowledgeable    
neutral; The Artisan cafe that was Booth s food area was delightful  and always had a wait to be seated  as it was so rightly popular  The new arrangement that is self service is a disappointing development  The service was slow  the food now lacking flair and the ambience quite lost  Shame  
neutral;I came here with my partner as many people had recommended it to us and the reviews seemed okay  We didn t have a good experience   We had to wait ages for our mains and when they came the steaks were not cooked how we ordered them   The staff seemed like robots  There was no interaction at all   The restaurant is decorated very nicely and it does have a lot of potential  The cocktails are very nice but service needs a lot more work 
neutral; We have eaten steak from here numerous times   always enjoyed it but it was too rare today even after going back to the kitchen  I didnt complain but the waitress offered to talk to the manager who offered ant desert from the menu apart from the    icecream to share  Although I didnt complain I thought the offer of a desert from poor as my steak cost    
neutral; the first and last time the burgers were tasty but the place was cold I had to eat with my coat on we ate and left without even looking at the dessert menu 
neutral; Went to the dancing duck for a few cocktails  it s a very loud place  so for someone like me who s hearing is not that good  I did suffer a little  The food that was coming out appeared to look good  but we was there for cocktails and service was slow  was not quite sure if we had to go to the bar to order or table service  table service took so long I ended up going to the bar to ask for the bill  staff didn t look so impressed with that   In the time we where there we could have had  or  drinks but only ended up having   teething problems I hope   Would like to try again as the atmosphere seemed good  
neutral; Stumbled upon this pub on a drive around pilling and knot end  initially we were told they didn t do food on wed lunch time    then they said ok    we had sandwiches which were lovely it s a pity the staff were miserable and unwelcoming    except for a young chap who worked very hard  On the plus side the food was good and they allowed dogs in the pub but they need to work on a more welcoming atmosphere  
neutral; The food here is nice   when you get it I have been here several times and each time is the same   the service is slow and the staff seem like they are beginners each time I visit   We waited over an hour for our starters   the next table arrived at the same time and had finished and were on their mains  Then the waitress tried to serve us starters again   Our main meal then took another  minutes to arrive  Don t go here if you are short of time  
neutral; Food is decent home cooked type pub food but is proper value for money  I wouldn t suggest this as a date or celebration restaurant but for something to eat before the cinema  it s perfect  My partner and I had starters  mains and puddings for    Pub is lovely  clean and decorated in a modern way  HINT: sign up to the email list here http:  www fayre square com  and get   off your bill :  
neutral; As we had been here before for food  we thought that we would be in for a nice Wednesday Lunch but how wrong we were   My Dad and I took my  year old Grandma who fancied Sausages and Mash with Gravy for her lunch  My Dad chose good old  quot  you cant go wrong with quot  Fish and Chips and I chose something new off the menu  which was the lovely looking  quot Chicken Caesar Taco Salad quot   Our food took a good  minutes to arrive and when it did get to us there were about a handful of errors and that really put us off our meals  Grandma s Mashed Potato was cold  No Gravy on her dinner and when I asked for it we were told they had No Gravy at all   Dad s batter on his fish was so crispy he had a job to cut into it  My Salad was advertised to have shavings of Italian cheese on   to be served with Croutons and of course have  quot Caesar quot  dressing on  I complained about my missing items and my waiter said he would investigate  This he did and came out with a little pot with cheese in it   Not Italian shavings but Grated Cheddar   No Croutons as apparently they did not have and Croutons and a pot of dressing  I went to put the dressing on and it was French Vingagrette  I queried this and the waiter said thats all they had so I said you cannot advertise  quot Caesar Salad quot  without having  quot Caesar Dressing quot  to which he agreed so he went hunting for it and it took  minutes but he came back with authentic Caesar Dressing  Hooray  I complained about all our problems and the Manager  who said he was new  came over to our table and basically asked our problem and I told him and he said that once again  he was new and that he had many problems with the kitchen as he had taken over the pub with mess and probs galore He apologised and gave us free desserts as some compensation  they took almost  mins to get to us so that was another problem  It was clean and tidy in general  I found that there was not enough communication between front of house and kitchen  Prices of food was very good in general and drink a little expensive in places I felt   
neutral; The title of this review says it all  The food is good and well presented   as it should be with only  covers  The bread and the amuse bouche are welcome and tasty the food is modernish in style but you feel that the owners are doing you a favour letting you eat there  However the price at   for three courses is way over the top for the quality 
neutral; I m not quite sure what all the fuss is about  This place is nice  but so are others  it doesn t stand out  I would definitely go back again if I lived nearby but having travelled for an hour based on such outstanding reviews and trip advisor listing it within the best  UK curry houses  I was totally confused  A good standard and yes  nice staff but the reviews on here just led to me being disappointed  
neutral; I have only ever made positive comments on Tripadvisor before today  However  something needs to be said about the female barmaid at the front of house  She was quite sarcastic from the start  I asked if I could have a glass of house red  She gave me the choice of temperillo or cab sav  I asked to have a glass of the  first choice  feeling slightly embarrassed  as I couldn t pronounce  temperillo   The barmaid responded in a sarcastic tone:  quot Temperillo  It s Spanish  quot    I then sat down with my husband  in front of the lovely log fire  She queried why we were sitting there  instead of the dining area  when ordering food  She then said:  quot I can bring you a tray  so you can eat it on your knees if you like quot I didn t like the barmaid s attitude  I value my weekends  as I work full time  She spoilt lunch   Although  I couldn t resist ordering  ketchup  when she asked if we needed any sauces with the roast beef dinner   Needless to say  the barmaid didn t get the joke   However  the meal was very nice  the pub was olde worlde  just such a pity to have such a rude barmaid serving us  
neutral;We had a very pleasant meal at this pub  The food was above average pub grub  good sized portions and something for everyone  I was spoiled for choice  Children s meals could be a little more adventurous  Was a reasonable price for the  of us   adults and one  year old   My biggest joy was that there was sorbet for dessert  When you are dairy intolerant  restaurant dessert menus are usually a no go area  It was delicious  Some of the cakes looked fab   Service was attentive and friendly The Animal Sanctuary is in its early days  It is small  and still being built but for a distraction for a  year old it was absolutely fine  We were there at feeding time so got to see the little baby meerkat  Very cute  Some of the animals are not well  I would have liked a bit of a back story  especially for the rather feather bare parrot  Might help with donations   We had a lovely time  I was recommended the place by my physiotherapist in London and am happy to recommend it to others 
neutral;We were made to feel very welcome and the staff were very friendly  Our party consisted of  adults and  children    I had mozzarella and tomato starter which was just ok  it was sprinkled with dried herbs where a fresh pesto dressing and basil would have been much nicer  Others enjoyed their starters   asparagus  king prawns and calamari  They accommodated one of the party by creating a seafood pasta rather than a risotto which they enjoy  I had Pasta al Forno which was as expected but tasty  My husband had a Calzone and the dough was undercooked in places but the filling was nice    The garlic bread starter which the children shared was a bit thick and doughy as I prefer thin and crispy but again that could just be a preference  The kids had a pizza between  of them and they enjoyed that   
neutral; Being such a popular area in London  they sure don t have to do a lot of advertising to get custom  Right on the Riverbank at Waterloo  it is a nice place to go to but overall service and quality are lacking  Was disappointed compared to the other bar they have within BFI    
neutral; Went there for a coffee break  Unfortunately when you don t order food you are usually pointed to the basement  Beverages  an iced coffee and a tea  were tasteless and watery  Staff could be friendlier too  Overall cute cafe but don t have high expectations  
neutral; The first review by LondonOcean is spot on  We had exactly the same experience  A beautiful setting and warm welcome  however very disappointing service and sad to say brunch that I could have made better at home  Lobster scrambled eggs mysteriously just sold out at midday  the restaurant was  quot fully booked quot  but half empty   The waiter had to go back and forth to check whether I could have plain scrambled eggs  Our bread never arrived  Nearly one hour later  our order had still not arrived and when we enquired  the waiter returned on his back and forth journey  literally making a tour of the restaurant only to come back to us and tell us we were next  Very odd  I ordered a side of tomatoes that also never arrived  apparently they had cherry tomatoes but in fact only had buffalo tomatoes that could only be used for burgers  so no I couldn t have tomatoes  It all felt very amateur   I d love to return once they sort out their teething problems  I don t think they have mastered the brunch however I have heard good things about the chef so hopefully lunch or dinner will be a more enjoyable experience  
neutral; Was taken to this restaurant has a birthday treat  the place is small and very cramped  decor shabby  and the waitresses basically had little knowledge of the menu  After browsing the limited menu and observing the prices they charge  I would have walked out  However  the food was presented beautifully but their was not enough of it I actually could have eaten a take away after and I do not consider myself to be a big eater  For the    there is far superior japanese eateries would I return   NO 
neutral;My boyfriend and I recently checked out The Mexican Cantina during a visit to Newquay  We stumbled upon the restaurant whilst walking through the town  and deciding it looked okay from the outside  ventured in for a Mexican meal  our favourite What we found inside was quite bizarre  the Cantina itself is fairly shabby inside  with areas of peeling paintwork and several rundown looking tables and chairs  I imagine that it was decorated several years ago and hasn t been revamped since   I could be very wrong   but the decor is quite tacky and cliche  I can just about picture the look they were going for but it hasn t quite been achieved  It s certainly brightly coloured in there  but combined with the loud Mexican music  which is turned up so high that at times the Cantina feels more like a club than a restaurant  it s just too much  For me  it ruined the atmosphere of what I had hoped would be a delicious  relaxed Mexican meal  We were also surrounded by stag dos and families so it was very noisy indeed   The service we received was fine and the staff were friendly enough  Everything arrived fairly quickly after we ordered and drinks were prepared within seconds of placing our orders  Strangely though it seemed from a glance at the menu that several items were unavailable   there were  not available  stickers covering some of the dishes  Odd considering that The Mexican Cantina opens at  pm each day and we turned up at   on the dot and were the first table to be seated  Thankfully  the unavailable dishes weren t of interest to me anyway  but it doesn t look good if you re having to deny people choice before service has even properly begun    Portion sizes were okay but I wasn t convinced by the quality of some of it  I ve had far  far better fajitas in other Mexican establishments  including chain restaurants What you get at the Cantina isn t terrible value for money but  for example  we could have done with more guacamole  salsa and sour cream and a few more tortillas to finish the chicken off  The flavours were okay but the texture of the chicken we tasted was disappointingly rubbery  The same could be said for my fishcakes  which were chewy and fell to pieces immediately  Several dishes  including the onion ring starter  came with a very limp and shrivelled side salad that looked as if it had come straight out of a less than fresh packet of salad  Uninspiring  The onion rings themselves were not handmade and resembled frozen rings that I stick in the oven at home   Although I applaud the staff for coming and checking on us and looking after us all evening I think that the food and the atmosphere lets this restaurant down  I felt a little resentful paying the bill at the end of the night as it seemed a lot of money for the disappointing standard of the dishes we tried  I think that the Cantina is more suited to hen and stag parties or pre night out meals  If you re visiting for a special occasion like a birthday or holiday meal I would think again and try somewhere else 
neutral;Distinctly average pub food  Although we had pre ordered  our meals took ages to arrive and were really nothing special  Over priced too  Might be the sort of place your Nan would like but we won t be back 
neutral; This restaurant was recommended by several friends and having checked the excellent reviews on line we were really looking forward to our meal  Upon arrival there were no menus available as a they were all being used for a large party who had recently been seated  The starter arrived quickly  some of my calamari and my husbands scallops were burnt  The main course was okay although my husband had crab and tiger prawn pasta which was spoilt by the amount of crab shell left in the dish  The service was okay up until we had to ask three times for the bill before it appeared  The waiter then had difficulty dividing the amount in half  We felt  and a half % service charge was exorbitant  
neutral; We had visited Rebels last year when it st opened and was very happy with the place so decided to revisit and take friends after telling them how amazing it was  We went on a Saturday evening  as usual they don t have tables free but we was happy for them to call us when one became available and we went to a different bar for a few drinks st  We was called back after mins to say table was ready  Waitress was very attentive and we were served our drinks quickly  We chose our food  I am Gluten free so chose pulled pork  sour cream mash as the chips are not signed as GF  and slaw  the others got burgers   of which were  challenge  burgers so we was excited to see the size and of the boys could complete the challenge  To say they were disappointed was an understatement  The burgers looked nothing like the pictures online Not sure if the chef was different but it certainly wasn t a challenge burger  I found  chips in my pulled pork    I was absolutely traumatised and instantly lost my appetite  We called the waitress over and explained the  chip  situation which she went straight to the chefs and they assured her the chips are now GF    I no longer wanted my food as I thought I was in for a bad night  How do chips even get into the pulled pork when I had mash  And if the chips are GF why is that not now stated on the menu like the other GF options  Overall a very disappointing meal after such high expectations  Will not be returning anytime soon  
neutral; My son chose The Potting Shed for a Sunday evening meal as he wanted to try their Yorkshire Pudding Burger  Unfortunately they d run out of the YP Burger  and they had also run out of my choice of chicken burger  I had a pizza which was good and my son had one of the other burgers which he liked  There was also a problem locating one of the ingredients for my non alcoholic cocktail  but they finally found it  So there seem to be some teething problems but hopefully it will settle down  The restaurant was busy and the staff were friendly and helpful  
neutral; Expected great Sunday lunch but beef cold and chewy gravy thin and flavourless and yorkshire pud burnt and unseasoned  To cap it all the swede was barely cooked and red cabbage was no substitute for seasonal greens  On the plus side the butterscotch pudding was hearty although I was disappointed that the intriguingly named chocolate and apple crumble was  quot out of stock quot  at   p m  Service was also slow and seemed weighted in favour of the regulars not great p r  if the pub is trying to broaden its customer base  Come on Queen s Oak you have a beautiful location and friendly staff perhaps it is time for some fine tuning   
neutral;I have read some of the other reviews and can only think that we booked on a particularly bad night  We also had a voucher for a three course meal each and a bottle of wine and decided to make a night of it  with a visit to the cinema afterwards  so I booked the table for   pm  On arrival  we were pleasantly supprised to see that there was a Garden Centre attached to the restaurant and with  minutes or so before our meal  I thoroughly enjoyed my stroll around the shop  We then went into the resturant and first impressions were very good  It was raining outside and very windy  but inside it was lovely and warm with subtle lighting  We were asigned our table  but unfortunately this was right by the door and with the tables being quite close together  my husband was sat almost in the doorway  I also had very little room to sit down  due to another couple being sat directly behind  This said  when I asked for other seating  this was immediately granted and we were given another table  We placed our order and sat enjoying the surroundings  It then became evident  that there was only this waitress serving tables and the resturant was full  There was a party of around  on another table and she apologised to them for the wait  informing them that there was a function on that evening and therefore  there was only one chef in the kitchen covering the resturant  After quite a wait  we received our starters  my husband had a crab cake and myself prawn cocktail  which were very nice  After a further wait  in which time another couple had also refused the table by the door and then been asigned to another out of sight of the restaurant  we received our main course  My husband had chosen the veal  with roast potatoes and pan gravy and I  the chicken with wedges and a caesar salad  I hate to say  but his gravy was almost set with soft roast potatoes and mine was quite overcooked  really dry and had no dressing on the salad at all  as listed in the menu  I decided not to inform the waitress  as it was obvious that the restaurant was busy and we could nt afford to wait longer and we made the best of it  This said  following the meal  we chose our deserts  which were plentiful and lovely and saved the evening  I cannot fault the value of the deal we received  for the meal and a bottle of wine and the hard work of the waitress  but I did not feel the meal was up to the standard that I have read about in other reviews  I can only think that unfortunately we booked on the wrong evening and hopefully should we return  will enjoy the food and experience that others have raved about 
neutral; We go quite often  Today we went for Boxing Day breakfast  myself and my husband and our  yr old boy  we arrived at am  No kids menu provided just  breakfast menus  It was only as we were leaving i noticed a balloon saying  quot boxing day kids eat free quot   I queried this with a member of staff as we had just paid for my little one to have a lighter breakfast  Apparently it only applies to orders from the kids menu    questions: why was the offer not explained on arrival  and why were we not provided with a childs menu  Previous late morning trips to the same restaurant and we have ordered from the breakfast menu whilst our little one had something off the childrens menu so i can t figure out why this wasn t offered today 
neutral; Having travelled to the area  we stopped for lunch  sandwiches and drinks  very mediocre sandwiches  even asked would the child have salad on the plate  salad didnt amount to anything  presentation could have been better and we certainly paid for it  Not one to return to a shame because staff and surroundings were quite good  
neutral;I have eaten here quite regularly when going to performances at the RSC  the setting is wonderful and the staff are great     but when I visited on Friday the food was decidely average  I had chicken liver parfait with toasted brioche  I don t know how long it had been since it was toated but it was cold and rubbery  Main courses need a side order  or   to make a meal and the puddings are disappointing and bland  It s a real shame that the quality has slipped so much  as the setting and service are great
neutral; We love the food inSky Apple and the staff have always been lovely but we were really upset the lat time we went by the state of the toilets  They were smelly and dirty  Sky Apple please do something about this   
neutral; Went for an Xmas meal with three female friends in December   I booked well in advance and two days before we were due in  I had a courtesy call from a very polite lady advising me to pre book meals to ensure service standards were kept  Not a problem  We picked our starters  mains and desserts  although it would really help if they had more detail  what dishes come with  and were excited to hit a place which at least online looked like it had a good casual lively atmosphere fit for an Xmas meal with the girls    We arrived separately and all though the outside didn t do it much justice  two of us mistook if for a cafe and tried to get through wrong door   My friend arrived first and experienced the first of many arguments between what I assume was the manager and a new waitress as they tried to work out where our party should be seated   Once inside  although a little squished  the atmosphere seemed chilled  Our starters came out speedily without warning and I feel it would have been courteous to ask if we were ready especially as we were waiting on one guest  We had to send hers back  We received a complimentary jug of drink of some kind but when ordering drinks it seemed to take a lifetime to come to the table  Two of the ladies asked for a drink at the start of the mains only to receive it at the end    Waitresses very casually dressed  baggy sleeve in food no thanks  seemed to spend the entire evening walking about waiting to pounce on a free plate or simply stare at you a bit too long giving the impression they just want you to eat quickly and go  This was made worse when we were asked twice if we still needed the chair for our fourth guest who couldn t find the place and was told a number of times about the time limit they have for diners This was a real shame as the food was tasty    Decent size portions  more then one potatoes with the lamp chops though please   Way too many confrontations with the manager and new employee which wasn t nice to hear or watch Any telling off should be done out of earshot  Little things about this place bugged me like bringing the wrong cutlery  having to ask for the same thing more then once  asking for salt only to receive pepper  constantly feeling rushed  not enough promotion of BYOB or no alcohol  not very Christmassy and the whole thing about pre booking so service standards were kept up was a bit of a joke HOWEVER good food  excellent music and the staff  minus infighting  were friendly   Different day  maybe a different experience so worth giving a go  
neutral; We came here for a birthday  and even though we had reserved a table they d lost our reservation   and not just ours  there were at least four other groups of people who thought they had a reservation who were without a table area  including those who had pre ordered food drinks  The manager didn t seem to care  he left the one waiter who was taking care of the floor trying to keep a lot of frustrated people happy  and he definitely did his very best  it s a shame that there weren t more like him working that evening  Granted it was a Thursday in the City  but you d expect a chain like All Bar One to manage their reservations better  Overall  I consider this venue a good choice for lunch  or if you happen to be passing and it s not too busy on a Friday  pop in and make the most of their Friday fizz offer  
neutral; I visited with my partner for a midweek treat   Our food was nice  and the atmosphere was ok  We had some nibbles to start followed by steak  I was disappointed to only see one type of steak on the menu as on their website there s much more advertised  I was expecting better than nice  I had heard great reviews from colleges  Our service was ok nothing above average  Another table of  sat down while we were finishing  They must have been locals and looked to be receiving a great service    Maybe my expectations were too high in the first place  
neutral;We booked this restaurant as we live locally and I feel some of the reviews are very harsh  Not sure why plastic glasses were used unless sitting outside  We were a party of  friends  On booking we were told   was the earliest we could arrange  On arrival  only  or  tables were being used  so not sure why we had to book so late   The staff were very friendly and took the time to explain the menu and were knowledgable when asked what items were or tasted like  We ordered the baked Camembert to start and the waiter told us it would take  mins to bake  Thats great as its nice to know food like that is freshly prepared to order  We received an amouse bouche of home made onion bhajis  homegrown tomatoes and mayo which was wonderful  Best onion bhajis ever   All the starters were very good  The Camembert was served with toasted bread and homemade chutney  An excellent sharing dish   For the mains we had  steaks   all very good A twisted prawn and langustine salad   also very good    +  A steak and ale pie was described as too dry   it needed gravy inside   I had moroccan spiced lamb shank   The meat fell off the bone and was excellent  However  the cous cous and vegetable tagine were a little bland  I expect a spiced dish to have more flavour   None of us had room for dessert as the portions were very big  The bill for  of us came to almost   inc drinks  Its not a cheap night out  They do however  have a set menu for lunch at    for  courses and Dinner at    for  courses  They have  choices for each course and it looks excellent value   Overall  we had a good night and most of the food was excellent  Its such a quirky place its well worth a visit  but take plenty of cash with you 
neutral; The concept of Five Guys is nice and refreshing   simple menu you can adjust for your taste  toppings  sides etc   Upon arrival the place is clean  has just been refurbished  and is conveniently situated in an entertainment complex  near cineworld   Although there are many other chains surrounding Five Guys it was quite busy   perhaps still a novelty  Staff were exceptionally friendly and always working hard  After ordering from the small but sufficient menu we got our drinks and found a table while we waited for our food  Did not have to wait long and our food was ready  picked it up from the counter then sat down to eat  Food was fresh and hot and the order was correct  Perhaps overpriced for fast food  but tasty nontheless   I would go back to Five Guys for a casual bite to eat but after all it is what it is   a fast food restaurant  
neutral; Staff were very friendly  but as for the restaurant I actually felt that I was sat in some ones loft  the food itself was ok  but I didn t think there was much of a choice  This isn t a restaurant I would recommend or return to  
neutral; Went for lunch with a friend at the weekend  The service was fine but I wasn t impressed with the pork and apple baguette which was from the specials board  Hardly any apple and the meat was really fatty  It was very busy in there so maybe it was just a one off  I would probably go back but not in a hurry  
neutral; The location of this pub is really great  especially if you are able to go in the garden to have a drink  weather dependent    We had a meal in the only bootable part of the restaurant  which had no atmosphere in at all  just a room with table   chairs  no bar or anything  When I called to book  I was told that it was full  but they could squeeze us in  but in fact the restaurant was empty bar one table  so didnt make for a great atmosphere  The food was average  although the menu appears to be more than that  The service behind the bar was friendly  and the female waitresses were very good  All in all it was ok  but with the tough competition nearby  I think it needs to improve slightly  
neutral; There were four of us  took a bit longer than normal to get seated and served  Food  when it came  was good  Have to say the place was packed and all staff on duty were working hard  I m sure the lack of table time afforded us was down to this and not because staff couldn t or didn t care to make conversation whilst serving  The only real gripe was that we waited an age for our bill  
neutral;I went here  weeks ago for the first time and although I loved the setting of the restaurant   I must say the meat was very dry and disappointing   considering the total of our bill    I would not go back here again 
neutral; The team at Nazmins serve consistently good food however every time we visit they are let down by their poor service  They have some great dishes on their menu  including the normal ones you would expect from an Indian restaurant  However  I think they need to focus on their service if they want to be viewed at a level above the standard curry house  
neutral; Excellent value cupcakes compared to rip off chains out there  Maybe one day the shop can expand to seat more people   My visit was on a Friday lunch time and the place was heaving  Sadly the large cakes had all gone  Was impressed with the lunch menu   Overall a tiny local gem  
neutral; After hearing so much about this restaurant we visited with friends who raved about it  The furnishings and decor were modern and extremely clinical  The pre dinner drinks were very expensive and not served well  with cucumber in a G and T instead of lime  The waiter admitted he had made an error  There was very little ice which melted very quickly watering the drink down and leaving it warm  Our starters were OK  and only OK  My main course  the lamb  was served with little else on the plate although the menu boasted more  The accompaniments were hidden under the lamb steak  Neither redcurrant jelly or mint jelly sauce were available  I was offered a jus which was normally served with another dish  Very sad  I skipped dessert  We paid the bill and left  There definitely won t be a second visit  
neutral; Can t fault the warm welcome from Chris and Sandra  and the fact that  although they don t do food on Sunday evening  something I d stupidly forgotten to check beforehand   Sandra actually cooked for us   a very welcome ham  eggs and chips  We spent a pleasant evening chatting to the locals in the bar  enjoying the very good beer in front of a roaring log fire    Our room was large and clean  the water in the shower hot  and fresh milk in a small fridge was a bonus  Sadly  we didn t find the bed or the pillows particularly comfortable and the room certainly needs updating   something Chris told us they do intend to do  so it would be unfair to criticise anything just now   Breakfast was a full English  take it or leave it   no other options available  which was rather disappointing  as I prefer a more continental breakfast   though it was tasty  Coffee was good  though a shame that the butter was in little packets and the jam in little jars   My rating is based on our whole experience   it s a great village pub  but sadly we won t be staying again  
neutral; Our family met up here for breakfast and when we were taken to our table we felt as though we were imposing  We ordered various breakfast items which were ok but the tea   tea  We were brought a cup of warm water with a tea bag on the side  If I was in America I would expect that but I would still ask them to put the hot water on the tea bag before they brought it to me  I did not expect this in England however  how on earth is the tea meant to brew like that  The tea is ridiculously over priced too  Frankie and Benny would do better to offer pots of tea  at least that way it would brew  
neutral; Lovely olde world pub located in the country side  Large car park and lovely scenery  The inside was very inviting warm and friendly  Staff were efficient and welcoming  Started off well with our starters  unfortunately two of the dinners we had were well below standard  The belly of pork was all fat and there was no crackling on it  The potatoes would of been ok if they were hot and Yorkshire puddings were not great either  Could not eat it so both meals were returned  Very disappointed  Three out of the four puddings were ok but the fourth was returned as inedible  Don t think we will be returning to eat here  Shame as the pub has so much character  
neutral; Went here for dinner with my fiancÇ¸ during a recent trip to Cornwall having read several raving reviews about it  Although we had made a reservation  when we arrived it seemed as though someone had forgotten to write it down and we were made to wait about   minutes at the door whilst they figured out the issue   understandable as it was a bit busy that evening  We waited about an hour from ordering for our mains to arrive and were not terribly impressed   the food was good  but not what you would expect for around   a plate  Perhaps lunch would be a better option next time  
neutral; Went there yesterday for a girls night out and it was okay  Didn t eat food so I can t comment on that  but we did have drinks  I ordered my drink   Long Island ice tea  and my girlfriends ordered their beverages  Theirs came after a few minutes and i waited and waited and waited  Nothing arrived  Had to go to the bar and speak to the waiter who originally served us and ask if my drink was coming  Not a good start  Funky Browns has a shisha area and its nice to go somewhere and not have to order a minimum number of shisha s to stay  Music good  people friendly and good vibes  
neutral; Lovely restaurant really cosy with very friendly staff  Was looking forward to a lovely meal but left rather deflated  Menu choice for me was not good felt as though the menu was too bistro rather than pub grub  Although the food was well presented and tasted lovely for me the menu lacked choice  
neutral; Visited here yesterday with my brother and my baby daughters for lunch  We utilised my taste card and therefore it was  for   We had calamari and mushrooms to start which were a bit disappointing   edible but I certainly wouldn t order them again  The pizza and pasta were fairly pleasant  On a  for  deal I would return for lunch but I definitely wouldn t pay full price  For evening dining out there are plenty of superior dining options in the area  
neutral; Maybe I chose badly  but my  quot pepper beef quot  burger came with a grilled mushroom that was rubbery and tasted overwhelmingly of burned pepper   inedible  Once i removed it  the rest of the burger was fine  I mentioned it to the waitress when she asked if everything was ok  but declined a replacement  To my surprise  she returned about  minutes later with a refund for the burger and an apology  That s good customer service and would make me think about giving the place another chance  
neutral;Bobbed in here for a quick drink before catching our train  Food was available which looked OK and I m sure if we d wanted lunch before our journey would have been adequate but not somewhere I d particularly choose to eat The pub is busy with travellers coming and going  using it as a waiting room They perhaps needed extra staff as the tables didn t seem to get cleared
neutral;This restaurant pub has improved since our visit last year but they need to get staff that want to be there and to not make customers feel like an inconvenience  they also need to pay attention to small things the sand wich I had was good apart from them using the stale end of the loaf which had been open to the air  it wouldn t of taken a minute to cut the end off    
neutral; Visited last year and had a very good meal but yesterday the plaice was almost all bone and really not worth the cost and the coffee was cool  Will find somewhere else next time  
neutral; A clean and well presented place  food nicely presented but not much imagination  Good coffee  cake wasn t as fresh as it could of been  think it had been frozen  A little pricey for the portions  Rarebit been a good example  Nice relaxed atmosphere  although a bit of soft light background music would have been good  Only real complaint was the incredibly slow service  Our view was shared by others  who unlike us  visit regularly  Pleasant enough staff but they all clearly had not received any proper training  inefficient and slow  which spoilt our otherwise pleasant visit  Would go again but please improve on your speed and efficiency of your service  it s letting you down  
neutral;We were staying at The Varsity  attached to the restaurant  and had a meal from room service on our first night  The food was excellent and arrived hot and exactly as ordered so we went down to eat in there on our second night   We ordered the exact same food as the previous night since it had been so good  We waited a while for our order to be taken  but that was OK as we were chatting about the day anyway  I ordered a Swiss Cheese Burger and asked for no tomato because I have an allergy  When it came the burger contained beef and cheese and nothing else at all  The previous night it had some salad and gherkin  It was quite dry so I pointed out the difference and asked for some gherkin  About ten minutes later a different waiter brought me a bowl of side salad  I was a little confused and said I hadn t ordered it but he just smiled  bowed slightly and walked off  I never managed to catch the eye of our original waitress and she never came back to ask us if the food was OK  The burger itself was also quite rare in the middle which I don t like  Obviously I should have said Well done  but the previous night it had been fine  and if I had been prompted by the waitress I would have remembered  So I was a bit sad that it went from great to not even OK after  hours   With hindsight  if I had made it very clear when I ordered that I wanted a  no tomato  b  gherkin at least and maybe some salad in the burger  and c  burger to be Well done  it would have been OK  Except that s not how people order  It looked like somewhere that is usually really good  and it was very popular  It just lost the attention to service that would have made our night more of a success 
neutral;We ate on Friday night here and it was heaving with people  locals and tourists  Staff were helpful in finding us a table and service was fine  Food was standard pub fare  we had steak and beef   mushroom pie  both of which were OK but not outstanding 
neutral; Too much food is not often a complaint  but here it definitely was  Smokeys is nice enough  there was not much atmosphere on our visit but I put that down to it being Sunday and really only the beginning of the Holiday season  Staff were friendly and efficient but there really was too much food  The starter was tasty and the pulled pork was good but easily enough for two  My burger was dry and relatively tasteless  with what seemed to be an entire lettuce as garnish  In a place with so many green credentials as Brighton I would hate to see how much food is returned and thrown away in this restaurant  
neutral; We went a few days ago  expecting great things  as colleagues of mine had commented on how good this was  My husband ordered the Henry the Eighth Steak    oz and my  year old had the  oz children s rump steak  I went for the oz Sirlion  My husbands arrived and I was very well cooked although things in this pub do come up less cooked than most   but was delicious and he ate it all  there were a couple of dodgy bits but with such a large steak it didnt really matter  My daughter which I cut up for her  was really done nicely without a hint of gristle or sinew  Mine however  was at least half gristle and sinews  I asked for medium rare but it was blue in the middle  When I mentioned that I had left half of mine due to gristle  the waitress said nothing at all  and when I asked if she understood  she said yer I know what you mean and took the plates away  Was nt that impressed to be honest  My complaint wasnt handled at all  She just looked embarrassed and scuttle off  Its great value here and nice enough  but watch what cut you have or be prepared to complain loudly early on if you get a bad steak  
neutral;I went to the Grand CafÇ¸ with an air of curiosity as to what to expect  I had a completely open mind   I arrived at  pm and our table was booked for pm  so I was advised by the head waiter to have a drink at the bar    I decided to have a cocktail  The cocktail list was not extensive but adequate  and when my cocktail arrived it was refreshing  It was a martini and the main ingredients were vodka and elderflower  As I waited I took in the atmosphere  The dÇ¸cor is bright consisting of vivid greens and pinks and the room is very spacious    We were seated promptly at  pm   Our starters consisted of fig and goats cheese and the soup of the day  The quantity of fig was minimal but the bread roll that accompanied the soup was very fresh  There were side plates to indicate that rolls were to be offered to everyone but this did not occur   My main course was significantly disappointing  I had looked at the menu prior to our visit and I had decided I would order the Vegetarian Cottage Pie and this was to be the highlight of my meal  When it arrived I was very unhappy as the dishes main ingredient was a meat substitute and it tasted very bland  I am a vegetarian that dislike  quot fake quot  meat and had expected a pie laden with vegetables and condiments   However  the head waiter was attentive as to whether we required another drink   My dessert was very ordinary  It was very simple consisting of ice cream and crumble  However  the ice cream was refreshing   All in I was very disappointed with the experience 
neutral; As a family we love Pizza Express and have visited quite a few  Sadly this venue just wasn t up to the same standard as others  The service was slow from start to finish  the waitress kept apologising but didn t improve her service to us  My son opted for the hottest American pizza  he needed a glass of milk as it was quite hot  After trying to get someone s attention he decided to walk up and ask for a glass of milk  She said she would bring it over  We then watched her chatting to two other diners for quite a while  If a diner has asked for a glass of milk as they are finding their food too hot you would think the waitress would sort that out rather than chat  The food however was good it s just the service that needs some improving  
neutral; Expected a lot based on reviews but was left feeling wanting more in terms of quality and value  However would give the bar  stars and would return  Sadly the restaurant I wouldn t  
neutral; We looked up The Bay Horse online before going  the pub looked lovely and welcoming and the menu looked extensive and homecooked  On arrival the pub seemed to have very few tables to eat at and all were by the door where it wasn t very warm  The menu was very basic and not homecooked  The food was average  if you need to grab a quick bite it s fine  The staff were friendly enough and gave good service with a smile  On a Saturday night though it appears to turn into some sort of club  loud music  people shouting and swearing and getting very drunk  I am all for people having a good time but it wasn t the atmosphere we were looking for whilst eating a meal and attempting to chat and catch up  I m afraid we won t be returning  
neutral; This is the first review i have ever posted  I went to Babbo with a business friend today for lunch  my suggestion  which I feel embarrased about now  Whilst I cant fault the food  which was very well cooked  I feel they need to look at their portions  I have eaten in some of the best restuarants in London over the years all considered fine dining  but this was without doubt the smallest portion I have ever come across  I know how expensive John Dory can be  but come on  pieces of butterfly pasta and  minute peices of of John Dory and a few sliced peppers is not a meal  Apple pie  there was no pie  it was a slice of apple on top on a pastry disc  Worst of all was taking the bread away whilst I was still eating it  We only accepted a second helping of bread after the main course becuase we were still hungry  so to take it away with most of it still on the platter whilst I was still holding some and eating it  is just not on   Whilst I would recommend for the quality of food  I would put a warning not to expect to come away with a satisfied tummy  
neutral; Booked a last minute meal at The Woodspeen last week for a treat  I have to say we have been before and the food every time just gets better   I had the Salmon to start which was executed very well whilst my partner had the risotto   which I have to say he would never usually choose  and was absolutely stunning  full of flavour and cooked to perfection  Main courses we both went for the beef fillet out of this world  again cooked to perfection  Whilst dining we were not offered any wine despite holding on to the wine list and mentioning that we would have some wine with our meal  This was very disappointing as we were out for a celebratory meal and would of like to try the red wine from Turkey  we were asked as we took our last bite if we would like a drink at this point I explained that it was too late and that we would of liked a glass with our fillet that we had ordered  I then saw the waiter tell the manager   I think his name is Alexandro from Italy  the manager did not come over to apologise and we were then left with no dessert menus   Surely this would be the time to turn things around  We then got up as we wanted to pay our bill and went to the bar to find someone to settle our bill for lunch  we asked if we could buy the Head chef   Peter a drink  the bar lady replied why  Which we told her that we had a great meal and wanted to reward him  The bar lady said that she needed to check with her manager  I saw the bar lady go over to the manager which I not see him ask the Headchef what he would like to drink and when receiving our bill a glass of Champagne was added  we do not mind if this is what the chefs tipple is but after the manager was involved is seemed that it was just added for his amusement especially when the bar lady came back with a smile  I am not sure if the chef will ever received his Christmas drink  I think the manager is very arrogant and needs to work on his customer service  We will be back    but hopefully when we do the MANAGER is nowhere to be seen   Great place to dine if you get the service to match up with the fantastic food that is being produced  
neutral;We were really looking forward to our visit here  but left feeling a bit underwhelmed  The food was nice  but not very exciting and for the price I would have expected a slightly higher standard  The decor was also very dated and quite gloomy  If they invest a bit more in this place I think it could be lovely  but it s not there yet  The service was very good though 
neutral; Good place with attentive polite staff  Went in rd weekend of Feb  for girlfriends birthday    Food was good quality and very tasty however there really wasn t that much of it for the prices at all  Also wouldn t consider this  fine dining  place more like an upmarket restaurant: quite casual and dressed down as a venue   Manager the night we went was good and attentive  Wine selection good however I know the champagne we had was a good  quid more expensive for the bottle we had elsewhere when dining out    Worth visiting once If in brindley place 
neutral;Looks like how it appears on the TV  Fast fresh food but slow drinks service  Puddings were the best part of the meal by far 
neutral; The service was very good  attentive  The atmosphere was fairly good  nice and warm on a cold night  The food was nice enough  just not memorable or particularly interesting  It is cheap enough for it to feel good value for money  I felt I got what I paid for  and would consider a re visit  I would not recommend it for a special occasion  
neutral; Visited for tea on a Thursday  On arrival the table was a bit ruby with lumps of mashed potato left from previous diners  I ordered Surf n Turf my  quot medium quot  steak was tough but the meal was hot   scampi cooked thru  Onions were a bit sparse and a squishy mush under my steak  Chips were served in a separate bowl  No other veg apart from half a grilled tomato    bit disappointing  As the evening passed the pub got busy   obviously popular but i think it was quiz night  I also had dessert cadburys choc fudge sundae very nice   
neutral; Gone on occasions  lost a lot of ambiance  better a few years ago  Changed hands a few times needs to reevaluate  menue  and service  and price accordingly   
neutral;Called in here after walking the coast path from Mousehole with husband and son  The cafe was empty when we arrived  so we were served quickly    The main problem was we were able to hear all the loud banter between the young men preparing the food and drinks  In particular  my son ordered a sasparilla to drink  we then had to sit there and listen to them going on and on to each other about how  disgusting sasparilla is  and how revolting the hot chocolate that my husband had ordered was  It wasnt meant maliciously  just was pretty unprofessional   The food was good  but pricey for a crab sandwich  for the  disgusting  sasparilla    In all  it was decent enough food  but would I go there again out of choice  probably not 
neutral; The boot should work well but there are a few things wrong which put us off going back  Service starts well  with friendly staff and the food is good though a little expensive for pub fare  But it s as though no one is in charge from thereon and the staff have a habit of forgetting you which can sometimes mean having to call them over to take an order even though they re clearly not busy and the courses can take much too long to arrive  Apart from own frustration at the slow service we watched others responding the same way  This is our second visit in a short space of time and the experience was the same  Also it should be a cosy place but actually it s cold enough to need winter woollies  Not much is needed to improve the boot  a bit of leadership  more attention to the table service and turn the heating up a bit  Simple things that wouldn t cost much but enough to make a real difference and fill this place up rather than it being half empty  
neutral; Visited thus place with friends  It s a busy pub   restaurant so you have to book  In fact it was so busy the night we visited the servuce whist good was slow  Starters were good but mine had a chutney missing  main meal was ok but a medium  well fillet steak was over cooked and quite tough  I think over all this place is ok but because they are so busy silly mistakes didn t make for a great meal  Staff very pleasant though and made us feel welcome  Will go back to try again and see if it s different   perhaps Sunday lunch  
neutral; The decor is bizarre and the bar area is too open great vast spaces missing tables and chairs which on a Saturday should be filled with people  The atmosphere was cold and for a date night it didn t work  We had waiter service and got cocktails  It took around  minutes for these to come to our table even though there was no queue at the bar  We were considering getting some food but just weren t inclined to stay and wait even longer  It took so long to get service that after finishing our cocktails  which were tasty and well sized  we paid at the bar  We were charged   for service   Not in a hurry to go back  
neutral; I have visited The Aviary on four occasions  It is fairly local to me and I like to support local businesses  Two visits were fine but the other two questionable  On one occasion I just ordered coffee and a scone  The scone was dry and it was difficult to swallow  Definitely not fresh  I mentioned it to the staff who didn t offer me another one but deducted the cost from my bill  This was fair but should never have happened in the first place  Before Christmas I went and has the roast beef Sunday lunch  It was excellent and told friends and family they must go there and treat themselves  However I went last Sunday and asked for the same Sunday lunch beef meal  What a disappointment  Firstly the beef was cut thinly and edged in stringy fat that was extremely difficult to cut off  The Yorkshire pudding was a small frozen one  unlike the previous home made one  And the gravy came already poured over instead of in the gravy boat  They may seem small points but they made the experience disappointing and I felt embarrassed taking my friend after telling her how fabulous it had been  I mentioned it to the young waitress who just shrugged and said she wasn t aware it was different but would mention it in the kitchen  Nobody came to see us  I wasn t looking for a free lunch but I got the distinct impression the staff didn t care either  When staff come and ask if everything is okay with the meal I would expect some feedback if it wasn t  I ve now told family and friends not to bother going and stick with the local carvery at the pub  
neutral; Food was a bit bland  I had a medium dish and debated asking for some fresh chili to add a bit of heat  The flavours were nicely blended just needed a bit of heat too   However the restaurant is nice and clean and wasn t too expensive  
neutral; Still a pleasant restaurant  comfortable seating  service good  I think there may have been change of ownership  or just the menus have changed  Sadly the only choice for sunday lunch was the set menu  my mother was unable to have an easily digestible starter   her normal fare   so she and I plumped for child portion of roast beef  Again sadly  the beef was tough  On the plus side the half a chicken roast for the other member of our party was HUGE  We have eaten here in the past and had very good roasts  and also eaten mid week with good results  so we are hoping this is a one off  There are other main course choices on sunday   none that appealed   so a few more choices in the starter smaller appetite section would not go amiss  |At   for a roast not the best value I thought as the veg tasted like the help yourself at Tobys  
neutral; I guess that I kind of knew that it may be a bit difficult for gluten free dining Nice enough place and staff tried to be helpful and accommodating But who wants to wait for a complicated allergies book to arrive and wade through trying to work out what is possible to safely eat  Thus I went for the minute steak and fries as seemed easiest option Nice and hot steak a bit smallish but cooked ok  salad not great but plenty of hot fries Puddings  another story My Eton Mess was basically strawberries on a mess or mass of cream Where was the meringue mystery I mentioned this and was offered a refund but opted to have the other GF option of creme brulee It was ok The wine was good and reasonably priced Shame this pleasant cafe type bar can t up it s game for coeliacs  
neutral; There has obviously been a lot of money spent on the refurb of Satsuma  Gone are the long bench seating replaced by prison jump suit orange booths and slate basins in the bathroom  What you gain in privacy in eating just as friends  you lose in portion sizes and value for money    This is a shame  the food is really good  but now seems stingy  If you are expecting big bowls of steaming noodles or sizzling gyoza  I think you are better off at china town nearby   Cannot fault the service and it is still a nice place to eat  but it has lost it s way in trying to be more upmarket than it is 
neutral;Visited the five bells and we re greeted with a really friendly welcome by the bar staff  Seemed pretty quite in there  a few couples and one table of   adults with kids  Food was amazing  I mean really amazing  staff couldn t of been more friendly but  the table with   adults spoilt it for us  At the end of the day we are in a pub and of course people chat and laugh  but to get nerf guns out  yes nerf guns and start firing them across the pub whilst people are eating is just rude and inconsiderate and the staff should have told them to pipe down  but instead just watched on looking rather uneasy  They were running around  shouting and screaming at the tops of their voices and then one kid run behind me aiming the nerf gun  This was at pm in the afternoon not near closing time when you ve had one too many  My husband wanted to have a word but I didn t want the confrontation so persuaded him not to  When we went up to pay  the bar men apologised for the  quot nerf gun issue quot  and said it was the landlord getting carried away  whether or not he meant he was part of that group  or that he allows that type of thing in his pub  I don t know   Did it spoil my dinner  yes  would I give it another try  Yes we would  like I said the food was A mazing but next time wouldn t be able to sit there and put up with listening and watching behaviour you would expect at a park not a pub   restaurant 
neutral; Family friendly pub but while the starter  platters  were excellent  the mains were a let down   salad with goat cheese   which was wilted and goat cheese forgotten   fish grill that had obviously been left drying in the kitchen for a while too  Basics missing like no Earl Grey or Peppermint tea too One waitress very good but two trainees serving too   busy place but meant lack of attention to detail  asked three times for chips  and toilets were not nice   Space available for outdoor play but no provision so limited family appeal apart from the food   Promising start but won t be rushing back  
neutral; We visited Kudos for a family birthday meal   adults in total  The food and service were very good  However  the food did not match the very high price of   per head  This did not include service as that was optional  which we declined to pay as quite frankly we felt that although the food was very nice it did not warrant such a high price tag  The service was good  but again  not exceptional  Portion sizes were fairly average and it is a shame because the restaurant itself is a very pleasant venue and quite different from most chinese restaurants that I have visited  Unfortunately  I won t be visiting again as the price really was just too much to pay and left a bitter after taste  There are plenty of other Chinese restaurants within Canterbury and surrounding towns that will offer just the same quality of food but would be at least   cheaper per head  Sorry Kudos  but your prices really were just too much  
neutral;As a local ive known munchies for a long time   unfortunately can rarely afford to splash out here but thought id treat myself  Food was lovely  all freshly made and of great quality  However it is over priced  not for Aldeburgh  its normal   feel like the price is designed for those who holiday in aldeburgh not those who just simply visit  Nearly   for a sandwich is a tad steep really  Everyone is encouraged to shop local in aldeburgh   but with prices like this its impossible  except on those rare occasions    apart from the price though   brilliant
neutral; We visited as the restaurant opened at  as we had tickets to the theatre and needed to be there for   The idea of the restaurant is that you have a place card red on one side and green on the other  If you want meat the card is placed green side up  once you have had enough you place the card red side up  There is a selection of salads  potatoes and breads that you help yourself to  This is a set price and you eat as much as you want    As we arrived the chefs were still loading splits of meat so many of the options were not yet ready  For the first half an hour we only offered sausage and chicken  We were a group of  and had pre booked so this was disappointing  By about  the remainder of the meats started to be offered  two of the three types of steaks were very tough  one almost inedible  with the cheaper cuts of steak maybe split roasting is not the best idea   Maybe if we had eaten later in the evening the experience would have been better  However it is not somewhere that I will be hurrying back to as there are better restaurants in the city centre and for the quality of the food I think the price is rather high   probably to offset the big eaters that go and take advantage of the  quot eat as much as you like can quot  concept  
neutral; Found this place on a dog friendly website  Whatpub  for our party of six plus two dogs only to be told it was ILLEGAL   rubbish  to bring our dogs in when we arrived  I had telephoned the pub before we arrived to check and they said it was fine  Not impressed   The dogs stayed in the car and we all had sunday roast  veg was nice and great yorkies but meat was overcooked and grey  
neutral; My friends and I have been customers of The Swan for many years  I visited with one set of friends last Saturday lunchtime  th and again with different friends lunchtime today  Firstly I have been told it is the same chef but I have my doubts  My favorite filo parcel was  in my opinion slightly overcooked  it was burnt on the edges and dry  It was served with sauteed potatoes which do not seem to go with this  it used to be served with new potatoes  My friends had scampi and requested dressing for their salad  they were told there was none  that they no longer served this  I have NEVER asked for salad dressing and been refused before in any restaurant  We had a table booked for   and were the first ones to be seated  The dining room soon filled up but at   we were still waiting for our food  We observed that no one in the dining room had food  Others were served before us  we were then told that the filo pastry was taking time to cook  This has never been a problem before  The staff appeared slightly embarrassed  We expected  since the prices had increased  that we would be getting an improved menu but sadly not the case  I used to consider the sea bass a healthy choice but now it is served in a pool of rich buttery cream sauce  Get the old chef back  quickly   We were not impressed  My friend asked for an Earl Grey tea when we had coffee  again she was told they did not serve it  There was a time they would send someone to the Co op to buy some quickly to satisfy the customer  My daughter worked there  so I should know  Just very average now  We ended up only having a main course  
neutral;The food was over priced and average with quite a basic menu   I expected more seafood given the location  Beautiful restaurant tucked away on a cobbled street with a stunning view across the harbour  The staff were all excellent  Given the selection of restaurants in the local area   people may well find this the best of the lot but I found the food disappointing with a hefty price tag 
neutral; Second visit  sorry won t be back again  Poor food can t believe prepared by a professional chef  overpriced and lack of staff on both visits  Left before completion of meal 
neutral;It is such a shame that I received poor service as it completely ruined what could have been a great meal out  On arrival  my mum and I both followed the instructions of a sign and went downstairs to wait to be seated  However  although there was visibly plenty of staff around who all saw us waiting  it took a while before we were actually shown to a table  The waitress who took our orders was grumpy and snappy for no apparent reason and practically threw the dessert menu at us  I ordered the Skinny Pollo Piccante pizza for a main  I enjoyed the pizza  would have preferred more mozzarella cheese and if the salad leaves had been cut finer  but the pizza base was light and crispy and the chicken was good  After our meal  I was disappointed to find it took  minutes for a member of staff to clear our plates and ask if we would like to see the desserts  even though there was about + staff crowded nearby our table  I ordered the chocolate melt and it was delicious  hot  gooey in the middle and really rich  it went well with the creamy vanilla icecream  I am pleased I decided to have the pudding as it put me in a better mood after receiving such poor service  I would definitely visit Zizzi again  but I would not return to this chain after experiencing such poor service 
neutral; Went for lunch today   o`clock   We decided to go after having been with family group last month and finding the food good  Today we ordered rump steaks and a bottle of wine  Food was good  would have preferred the chips in a seperate dish as everything was piled on the plate and the service was quick  However  the music was horrendous  We would have expected it if it had been late at night but not  o`clock in the afternoon  I can only compare it wih a session at the gym or at a disco  definately not music for lunchtime  Personally I would have asked them to change the music but my husband does not like any fuss  We finished our wine and left  Normally we would have a dessert and a speciallity coffee but the music put us off  Another point was that our plates were not cleared   they were still on the table when we left  We live locally so very disappointed as we thought we could have made this our local  
neutral; We have visited twice in the last  weeks and the  visits couldn t have been more different  The first time was on  Curry  night  It was very busy but we managed to get a table  We had to ask for it to be cleared cleaned but it was exceptionally busy  We all had the curry which was lovely and great value  We decided to return with friends a few days later  how embarrassing to have recommended somewhere that turned out to be so bad  Some starters came out with the others coming about  minutes later after chasing staff about them Half way through our starters we were asked if we were ready for out main courses  We said no as we had only just received the other half of our starter order  After an hour and half of waiting for our mains once our starters were finished we asked the staff only to be told that they kitchen was just starting our order  My steak arrived and looked like it had been on the grill for an hour and a half  when I told waitress that I had ordered it medium not well done she just laughed it off  We spoke to the manager who went to chase our food and it miraculously appeared  We were all past being hungry by then  The manager did offer free desserts which was very kind however with  very hungry children who were all fed up of waiting  the last thing we wanted to do was wait another  minutes for the desserts  Such a shame as our first experience was very good however the second visit was our last  
neutral;Visited here with my husband and was looking forward to our  quot date night quot  there but when we entered the girl at the desk showed us to our seats but we couldn t hear a word she was saying because of the noise level in there  We ordered food and wine and the starter of a deli board with a selection of cheeses and cold meats was delicious with the pickles and other accompaniments  Have to say the service was very good with attentive staff ensuring that our glasses were kept filled  Main courses were mixed  my skewer of lamb with chilli  garlic and mint yoghurt served with couscous was tasty but while the other half s steak was ok he wasn t impressed with the chips  Unfortunately as we were finishing off the wine I could see marks on the table which hadn t been cleaned properly from previous occupants The chocolates served with the bill were a nice touch and delicious  
neutral; I have always enjoyed this restaurant for location quality of food and service  However I am sorry to say that based on my last visit  last Sunday it is not as good as my previous experiences   We arrived at about  pm on Sunday afternoon and ordered one dish off the Sunday lunch menu and another a la carte  The restaurant wasn t particularly busy  We sat in the entrance area and there were only another  tables taken  There were some more diners at the back but not unduly busy for a sunny  warm Sunday afternoon   By   we still had not been served our food  I went to the counter and asked if we had been forgotten  The girl went to find out and came back saying that it was being dished out  It arrived at pm    And I can t remember receiving an apology for the excessive delay    The food was excellent and this is obviously reflected in the rather high price  The quality of the food is the only reason I awarded it    We did enjoy it and at the end just before finishing our drinks I went to the toilet  When I came back  my drink still unfinished  one of the girls was busy clearing our table and told us that we had to move as the table was booked UN BE LIE VA BLE   How is that for lack of sensitivity and customer awareness  Some urgent training needed here Mr or Mrs manager  This is a totally unacceptable way of dealing with your customers even if your food is excellent  I for one will not be returning in a hurry  
neutral;I used to love this restaurant but since I had to start using a wheelchair it s a no go due to their odd front door configuration  Such a shame 
neutral; Stayed at the Premier Inn next door and had breakfast here both mornings we stayed  Breakfast is first rate with an extensive choice and something to suit everybody    However meals in the evening are a total contrast  The quality seems to go out of the window  it is so different to breakfast  Quality of produce is average at best and just seems to be put together on the plates with very little thought  Everything on the plate was different temperatures down to the veg which was cold  Didn t bother to send back as waiting staff seemed very dis interested in their jobs and thought would be more trouble than it was worth   Didn t eat in here on the Saturday evening but was seated next to a table where people had  We were sat there for over an hour with drinks and the table was not cleared    People who greet you to seat you are excellent as was the barman who worked Friday and Saturday evening but suggest that the waiting staff need to been given more training and show an interest in what they are doing   The place also needs a good refurb as looks old and tatty   Terrible shame as the breakfast was one of the best I ve had when staying at a Premier Inn  
neutral; So after reading and hearing so many positive comments about this place me and my partner decided to visit last weekend  The place is very pretty   well decorated and you can see that it has had a recent make over  All the waiters that served us were very friendly and correct   so far so good but now comes the food    well being half Spanish   my father a chef and living most of my life in Spain I know my stuff  So therefore if I criticize its because they need to improve slightly on some flavours of the dishes  We only tried  dishes so its not like I tried a lot but anyway for starters we had the Patatas Bravas and Pollo al Ajillo  The Bravas were not god at all   tasted like they had been boiled then tossed in a pan with some tomato sauce  They were slightly under cooked and the sauce was just that    like they had opened a can of tomatoes and chucked it in with a bit of spice  Guys come on you can do better than this  Its all about the sauce   it has to also be accompanied by garlic mayo which I had to ask for  Anyway my boyfriend had the other dish which was chicken and I did not taste it because I am not eating meat since some time now and I did not fancy it but it did not look very appetising and my man was not impressed so    thumbs down to the starters  The mains were Pizza and I chose the Spaghetti de la Mare which I have to say was a good portion and I did enjoy it but then again I was missing maybe a little more umph  in the sauce  perhaps a bit more garlic   maybe wine  Again I did not try the pizza but to my disappointment my man said it was just ok   The location is great and the terrace looks great to enjoy drinks in the summer evenings but I wont be eating there in a hurry again sorry 
neutral; We expected so much from copita as had heard lots about it but we had trouble getting any of the  staffs attention and it didn t improve throughout our meal  The menu does not state what has nuts and what does not and the staff did not know any better  When there are  tapas places in soho  i would definitely choose elsewhere  
neutral; The menu needs to be a little more varied  Some homemade proper meals would be nice to see like Lasagne  salad and garlic bread  or cottage pies and veg It would make people want to stay longer and feed their children there whereas now we pop in for half an hour and go elsewhere for a proper lunch  
neutral;Visited on a weekday for lunch after hearing excellent things from a friend  It was quite noisy inside despite being only half full but the staff were attentive and the atmosphere was nice  The food was the let down  Between us we shared a pulled pork crate and beef brisket crate  The pulled pork was the better of the two but was quite fatty and we make much nicer at home The beef brisket was on the cold side but this would have been nice if served warm but again we ve made nicer ourselves  I would have preferred the food to be smokier since it is supposed to be a smokehouse  Overall  I think for the quality of the food this place is far too over priced  There are much nicer and better value restaurants of the same genre elsewhere in Newcastle and we wouldn t rush back here 
neutral; I ve been coming to the pub for a number of months every sunday night and the recent change of staff is a pleasant surprise  the two very handsome young men behind the bar are a credit the pub and are a great laugh and are amazing to be around  they are the highlight of my week  one of them especially  called harry  makes the pub come alive with a pub quiz he produces himself  have yet to seen the landlord or landlady but if you ask me  the three teenagers behind the bar could do a fantastic job of running this pub  
neutral; There are vegetarian dishes available but theyre not on the menu  So when I checked the menu from the street I walked on by  Eventually went in because a friend arranged to meet me there  The waiter explained they prefer to tell people in person about the non meat menu  Very odd  More odd is that the restaurant is located in an area with a high vege population  Im not that bothered about returning  
neutral; We used to go to the Waggon   Horses when it was a carvery and have had some lovely meals there  however the past couple of times we ve been they have stopped the carvery and have turned it into a bit more of a restaurant than pub  The food was ok  althought I found the beef a bit too fatty and the broccoli a little too crunchy for my taste   The staff are friendly enough  and were happy to get more gravy when we asked for it although they weren t able to answer questions about what the soup was  whether they had sweeteners on site  The main problem was that it was so cold  I was actually shivering both times we went recently  I thought the first time might have been a one off so we went again and it was just the same  It actually made both experiences very uncomfortable and unpleasant so we won t be going back I m afraid  
neutral; Myself and my family went for my mother s birthday which was also mother s day  As soon as we arrived there was a mix up with our booking when we were finally seated the service was standard food was fantastic as always but we did not appreciate being rushed out the minute we had finished  It was very busy but that doesn t excuse the terrible service and being rushed out  We shan t be visiting again  
neutral; the atmosphere was very good  the service from the staff excellent  My family and I were celebrating my daughters birthday and all of us chose the carvery which smelt wonderful  Unfortunately the beef was very tough and the vegetables raw in the middle  they were very bland and while it was nice not to see peas and carrots as the only option  the swede would have benifited from being mashed perhaps and maybe a cauliflower cheese  Looking at the food of the other diners  sadly I think we made the wrong choice as the alternative dishes looked very good  I didnt feel I could complain at the time as I didnt want to spoil my daughters treat  it was only when we got home that we found we all felt the same  I will try this establishment again as I did feel that the service and the cleanliness of the resturant was good  maybe the carvery is their weak point  
neutral;Went for a birthday and promotion lunch  with husband and our two young boys  Food was really good  kids had mussels and fish and chips  we had oysters and hot shellfish platter  Service was so slow  we were in danger of rising sea levels due to climate change  The staff  although very polite moved at the speed of molasses  Come on  Crab  ditch some of your formalities  brighten the place up a bit and pep up your atmosphere 
neutral; massive selection of brightly coloured ice cream   staff not very helpful   worth a try to make your own decision was told it was home made in a farm  taste was very very very sweet   had better   at home now eating a hagaan daz    
neutral; Food is really good here and served attractively  Actual table waiting staff very pleasant but felt sorry for them as male and female managers over them seemed very controlling and hovered all the time making me feel uncomfortable  
neutral;We used to come here fairly frequent however it changed slightly  The booking online system was good and easy and they didn t mind when I changed the time  When we arrived I felt our welcome was not very warm  Football was on and it seemed like the bar man wanted to get back to watching the match with the regulars  The food itself was quite tasty but silly things let it down for me  We had the dipping bread to start and the bread was more like crostini which I did not enjoy  I had roast chicken and while there was quite a lot of chicken it tasted like packet chicken  I requested cranberry sauce  cheeky perhaps  and it didn t arrive til I had eaten all my chicken so bit pointless  Veg was very nice though  My husband had beef which he said was very tasty  Final course was Eton mess  It was average nothing special  My husband had cheese and the selection was good  strange but good  one cheese was so smelly   don t know the name  it actually made me gag  This is a brutally honest review   I am not a picky eater and I don t mind paying for what I get  I think the pub needs to iron out a few minor things with the food for me to return but the staff need more training some of them quite a bit  On the whole it was average 
neutral;Went a few weeks ago with friends  food was good  was enjoying the evening until i overheard the boss having a go at his staff  He seemed to be very annoyed about the fact that one of the waiters had decided to stick on the heating  which another one of the customers there that evening had asked the waiter to do   Alot of mouthing off  ranting  being rude and disrespectful  was VERY awkward and embarrassing to listen to    I felt very bad for the poor waiter who was penalised for taking care of his customers  Surely  Mr Boss should realise the importance of ensuring his customers are looked after well  they are the people bringing in the money  And also the waiters who provide a fab service and without their professional and efficient service  the place would not be as successful    Good food  but VERY put off by the ranting and bad attitude   shame on boss man  Good food  and excellent service by the waiters : 
neutral; some things are good and some things are bad depending on what you have  Wouldnt recommend going if you just want a drink its been overrun by the restaurant side 
neutral; The staff were friendly and very efficient  The food was lovely however my partner said that the chips were hard  I did find that they were tight on gravy and it made the mash very dry and hard to eat  It was advertised that i would get a large yorkshire pudding with my roast and i only got small ones  however they were nice and i did enjoy the meal  I wanted to get a pudding as they do a COOKIE PIZZA with ice cream  cookie  fudge and sauce  but i was stuff from my dinner as it was large portion  VERY GOOD VALUE for money  at two meals for    drinks a little expensive  
neutral;The fitteer has always been great from here and the kosheri used to be just the same  but lately it s not the same  it just doesn t taste as good any more  sorry Meya
neutral; We went on a Saturday evening  and were one of the few tables with fewer than about  people  The food was lovely  service was very friendly but very slow  
neutral; Visited Sunday  late afternoon  Very long wait for food  Children s meals which seemed good value when I ordered them but rather poor quality  especially peas which looked almost grey  Neither of my children wanted to touch them and I don t blame them  Fish fingers looked as if they d been through a furnace and were dry and unappetising  Cheeseburger had a pitiful thin slice of cheddar on top of the burger  hardly worth being there at all  Chips were the best part of the meal  Mash was speckled with something or other which looked dark brown and my son didn t want to eat it  The garden area is very big but there are many trip hazards such as ironwork poking out of abandoned concrete bases and very uneven steps  You can t take food out to the garden area so we had to sit away from the rest of our party to eat our meal  This venue has the potential to be a lovely place to sit and relax but I felt disappointed and left feeling hungry  
neutral;Went for a meal here with some friends who had recommended it  We ordered Vegi and Sweet Potato Tempura to start along with Edamame beans  Whilst the beans were good  was disappointed with the Tempura as it came up looking like it needed a holiday and the batter was totally undercooked   not good  For mains  we ordered Spicy Chicken Udon Noodles and Spicy Mixed Seafood Udon Noodles  Considering the Seafood Udon was over    I would have expected a reasonable portion of seafood but thought the serving was a bit stingy and I felt I could have eaten it again  as did my friend  The Spicy Chicken Udon was good but also overpriced at over    I assume as there are no other Japanese restaurants in Watford that this accounts for the overpricing on some of the dishes  as if you were to go into London there are many Japanese restaurants that charge half the price of the dishes we ate here and the quality is very good  Not sure I would recommend this restaurant unless you go for some of the cheaper options on the menu 
neutral; We went with friends last week  the place was rather empty  yet we had to wait for food  We said to the waiter not to serve something but he insisted which was funny really  Food wasn t the best at all  it s presents it self as a good restaurant but the food doesn t support it really  The food was average and atmosphere not the best  I don t think I will return  
neutral; Came here in Sunday and as enjoying it last time came back again but this time wasn t as good  They have took Texan chicken of the menu which I loved so instead I lasange which was lovely to be honest but not as good as the chicken   The new refurbishment looked great  Service wasn t good this time round as they doesn t come and remove out starter plates so I had to do it myself  Overall was okay but could of been much better  
neutral; Firstly I d just like to say the  stars is fully based on the price  apart from that the food is ace n service is there  would visit again  
neutral; Went to Planet Hollywood last year and had an amazing meal  was looking forward to coming back this year but was definately disappointed    We went during New Year  the restaurant had shabby interior  the upstairs seating area carpet was lifting and grubby  The service was slow  the atmosphere was terrible  really loud film advertisements on TV which were just odd  such as action films which kept buffering    The food was pricey and was just okay  Both had steaks which were nicely cooked but weren t as good as other steaks we ate around London   To make things extra special we left the money on the table with the bill  my partner went back to the table to get a scarf we had forgot and found the people sat next to us just about to steal the money we had left off the table    True to say  we won t return to PH when we come again this year  If you want a proper steak with a great atmosphere  head to Green Park to the Hard Rock Cafe 
neutral; Visited on weekday early evening  Just in time for the % of menu offer  Good atmosphere and busy  However I wouldnt have wanted to have paid full price for the food we had which would been   for average mousakka    for bland lamd dish with cous couse  and   for small side plate of nothing out of the ordinary houmous and bread basket with chopped up pitta bread   Food was average  nice easy convenient place to go for after work food that isnt a chain restaurant but check out the offers on their website first  
neutral;This is rather a noisy place and the queue outside caused mainly by the fact that you have to wait to be seated at the desk just inside the door  I have been twice  The first time was great however on the second occasion I questioned whether I had been given the starter portion of ravioli  it was tiny  There is also rather a lot of fried food which is a surprise but overall it reflects well on Mr Oliver
neutral; What s going on Rocksalt  We visited for a drink last night and sat outside  the decking is looking really run down  dirty smears on the glass walls and weeds about a foot high  
neutral; I have been here before but noticed the last time that the service wasn t so hot  Went with a friend on a Saturday  Service was very slow and although it was busy  there were empty tables around us and it was after the main lunch rush  The food was good  We ordered dessert but it didn t arrive and  when we asked after half an hour how long it would be  the waiter said he d forgotten it  More annoyingly  he seemed more amused than anything else about his mistake  We asked for the bill which had a discretionary gratuity built in to it which was a bit much in the circumstances  I d give it another go for the food quality but they need to sharpen their service  
neutral; We fancied a Sunday roast at Easter and we chose this pub because the family in the window eating their Sunday lunch looked happy enough  The pub had a nice enough atmosphere and  after a bit of a wait for our drinks order and the menus  we ordered our roasts for chicken for lamb   From this point on it was evident that the  friendly  waitress was mostly serving on her own and the kitchen were clearly letting her down  resulting in a long wait for everything  including a request for some mint sauce many of the customers at nearby tables were either complaining or looking disgruntled  The food was fairly tasty and the portion sizes were perhaps a little on the smaller size  The chocolate brownie for dessert was delicious  Our bill for  drinks   mains and  desserts came to    All in all  not a terrible place   we just spent far longer in here than we were hoping   but they definitely need more waiting staff and more reliable kitchen staff for a busy pub in the centre of Cambridge  
neutral; A lovely restaurant with a nice ambience  We were greeted warmly by the maitre d hotel we shared a seafood platter which was good  The sticky toffee pudding with stem ginger icecream was to die for  The service  however  was not great with no one particular person responsible for our table  It was difficult to get attention the bill was incorrect but quickly rectified 
neutral; I have mixed feelings  We have been to the Hop Pole on three occasions  There is normally a family group of  of us  I found the staff to be friendly and I love the beautiful decor  This is probably the prettiest restaurant I ve been to  On our first visit  service was a little slow but the food was great  On our second visit all was good but Yorkshire pudding a bit hard  On our third visit two weeks ago my orange juice had an odd watery taste and it had to be sent back  Staff changed it immediately  When the roast dinners arrived the Yorkshire pudding was awful   over cooked and very hard  I mentioned it to a staff member who said they would pass my comments to the chef  As a family we will probably visit the Hop Pole again but not for  quot special occasions quot   For example we are currently looking for somewhere to book for Christmas dinner but I m afraid to book at the Hop Pole in case food is disappointing  please Hop Pole  sort that Yorkshire pudding   I would say to potential visitors   give the Hop Pole a try  it s worth a visit  Let me just say again that the decor is beautiful  
neutral; Family celebration for large booking  Restaurant was accommodating and well decorated  By the looks of it there is an option for a private dining room too which looked lovely  Menu choice was acceptable for a Sunday lunch  I ordered the haddock and chips which  arrived  as I expected in a gastro way  with multiple fried chunky chips and two fillets of haddock   Was very filling but the dish did lack a bit of flavour and I relied heavily on the tartare sauce for a bit of extra zing  For dessert I have a rather thinly dished out crime brÇ¯lÇ¸e  which was still tasty   Not a bad restaurant  lovely decor  friendly enough staff  slightly heavy price tag but nice surroundings  
neutral; We spent a lovely morning at the Hauser   Wirth gardens in Bruton and had planned on having lunch at Roth Bar   Grill  but having seen the menu we decided we wouldnt bother  The menu was over fussy  and at    for a Sunday Lunch not particularly appealing  We decided to go instead to the Chapel at Bruton   I now know it s the same owners   We were met with the same pretentious menu  smashed peas  oh for heavens sake  just call them mushy  you re fooling no one   I have been told that the weekday menus are more  affordable   To be honest I will pay a high price if the food sounds amazing and isn t faddy  but the current fondness for adjectives used on Masterchef doesn t impress me  
neutral;What a shame really  I think in London most of the time  it s the overway around  So waht s the matter with them  Change your waiters  We had to ask to order drinks and then for food  They say they were coming but had to ask again  mn later  Waitress finally came  making a very unfriendly face  didn t say  quot Hi quot  or anything  just asked rudely for the steak  quot cooking quot  when my friends started to make her order  SO another of my friends told her to be more polite and less rude with us  so then she did make some effort and the rest of our meal was ok  I had the mussels and the frog legs  that was good  Tasted the Steak was very good too  only the duck was not that good  share starters  one meal and a glass of wine for   pp
neutral; Limited menu  food was good  but one of the most unfriendly restaurants I have visited  They were just not interested in making us feel welcome  Neither were we impressed that we were seated by the toilet door  although I had booked over a week in advance  
neutral;This place is yet another of those which were revamped and renamed in order to attract a more lucrative market in our current phase of gastro pubs    Prior to its current incarnation this place was a popular local watering place and when it started offering food some years ago  was known for its delicious steaks   Now  it is a pretty good  but somewhat bland and yet not inexpensive  place to eat    In its favour is the fact that you can meet there for coffee in its lounge area  and you re not chased out even if you drink only coffee for the duration 
neutral; The met has a nice atmosphere  mostly   It s a little bit chavvy at times  but usually has a pleasant atmosphere  I ve eaten there twice now  once in the restaurant  which was a pleasant experience  but all the meals were very expensive and there wasn t a huge vegetarian choice   Another time I had an open sandwich and chips  Thank goodness I got chips  after my slice of bread with cheese and chutney on I was starving  and still was left hungry after the chips  I think I recall that meal being around   or    Not what I expect to pay to still be hungry   However  they do have a nice beer garden so it was nice to be able to eat outside  You could go to the trendy northern qtr and get a big sandwich and some wedges for a few pounds less  much better value  
neutral; We ate here tonight with my husband and as it has been a few years since our last visit here we were really looking forward to a nice meal  Unfortunately  although tasty my meal was cold  On highlighting this to my husband he also reported his meal was cold too  We probably should have complained but it s not the sort of thing we do  However  on a positive the service was very good even though the place was heaving  In addition to the disappointing meal there was also a terrible smell on vomit both in the bar area and in particularly the ladies toilets  All in all not a good experience and such a shame 
neutral; Came here for our works Christmas meal  we had a mixture of the tapas menu and the   set menu   The service was impeccable  and we were served with a curteous manner and promptly   I personally had the tapas which were a good mix of different dishes  the patatas bravas were particuarly brilliant   Very impressed with the Sangria  maybe a little overpriced drinks wise though   Overall a very enjoyable afternoon  
neutral; We stayed here in  and the accommodation was great along with the food  We were in the area so thought we would go for a meal  The restaurant is now part of a chain  The food wasn t to standard and the service was very slow  When we received our mains  minutes after our starters were cleared away it was obvious that the meal had been left standing for awhile before the fried eggs were added  As it was very quiet at the time we couldn t understand why  Not as good as the first time we visited so a little disappointed as it was our anniversary  
neutral; Visited here with my husband one Wednesday Night  Had to wait about  minutes to order drinks  Service didn t match the menu prices  Expected much better service  Food was great  especially the Tart Tartin  Would give them another go though  
neutral;Stopped by last Friday for a quick bite before going for a walk  We were sittings outside  because the weather  and I must say the inside is nicely decorated and the bathrooms very clean  Staff was polite but less professional   I would say if they have to do the mise on place  please don t bring the cutlery in your hands   use a plate  or a tray  The food was not so amazing  I had a salad with endive and pear   but nobody informed me about the white sauce and the green leaves topped with Minute steak was fine  but not extraordinary   And they do coffee to take away   so my question is that if I just ordered a coffee and I paid for it  something urgent happens to me and I need to leave  I am not allowed to take my coffee away  I do understand about the food   but a coffee is a coffee   
neutral;It s a shame I can t give this more than a   rating as the food was really good here and the staff were lovely but I had a couple of criticisms  The first being that people were walking into the cafe just in their swimming costumes and men bare chested  I know this cafe is on the seafront but I still think people should cover up in certain places   Secondly due to the lack of toilet facilities along the promenade it was obvious people were using the Bay Cafe toilets even if they weren t eating or drinking here  We visited on a very sunny bank holiday weekend so this would have made it a lot busier but I look forward to trying again when a bit quieter  I would still recommend this place as for a cafe the food really was good with plenty of choice and good quality 
neutral; Ate hear for a quick lunch with my family normally it s cheap good food which does the job I ordered the fish and chips I really didn t eat much of the fish I didn t enjoy it much but can t really complain when your paying so little 
neutral; I love their breakfast menu  especially the Egg Benedict Royal  price is slightly steep but worth it for once in awhile  However  it will be nicer if the serving staff can be more enthusiastic and friendly and not reacting so cold towards the customers  Overall not bad  we will return for the great menu and hope to see some improvement in their services  :  
neutral; It took ages to get served with a poor quality beer  I suppose if you like drinking the water you washed granddad s socks in  you would be in for a treat  other than that  use in emergency only  
neutral;Decided to try the salt pig again after the last visit was disappointing  I opted for the creamy tomato soup  Hmmmm more like chilli soup  although it was nice it wasn t what I expected  it came with  chunks of bread with butter in  I asked the waitress if the bread could be changed as I don t eat butter  she politely said yes  took it back to where her   the chef if that s what you would call her  rolled there eyes  Not professional in front of customers  to then return the soup with  small pieces of hard dry bread  I won t be returning  I have been here  times    out of  meals have been disappointing   
neutral; We ate here on a very busy Friday evening in August  with our young daughter  We d travelled some distance and were a bit frayed and hungry  We hadn t booked  never occurred to me that a pub in small village would be full by We were strongly encouraged not t o bother waiting and when I said we d wait at the bar  that didn t seem to go down too well  I got the impression that the waitress didn t much care for the look of us and hoped we d go away  A table was found  moments after I made it clear I d wait  not full after all   and  mollified by the prospect of food  I found myself apologising to her  in case it was in fact me who d been rude  Then she was ruder still  Extraordinary way to treat customers  Food was delicious  with reasonable choice for my vegetarian partner  But the service  different staff by now  continued o be eccentric  It s a wonderful spot and compared to some of the truly atrocious pub food  we had in Dorset  the food was outstanding  But why can t they employ people who smile  are polite and know how to deal with their customers with a degree of charm  even when things get busy and fraught  
neutral; Have come here a couple of times now  Richmond is dying for good brunch spots so this will hopefully be a great addition with a few improvements as they settle in   The food itself is good but not great  The coffee could certainly be improved  nothing on Butter Beans down the road  The service is very hit and miss  The first time we went was early morning and we had no issues but the place was basically empty  The second time was disappointing  We had a mix up with our reservation and the wait staff were rude  as if it was our fault they had made a mistake with the reservation  Service then remained slow and it was hard to flag down to order  get our bill etc  Hopefully with a bit of staff training these guys can become a good dining option in Richmond  
neutral; We had travelled quite a distance to join relations who had eaten here previously and had enjoyed their meal  On arrival all looked very nice  A drink was spilled over one of our party   accidents do happen  The food was very nice and staff pleasant  The noise was absolutely dreadful  We were sitting right next to the bar area which really should be  walled off  from the main restaurant  A party of + cackling very loud women had been  let in  and quite honestly wrecked the evening  They were so loud both while at the bar and got loader when they all sat down  They had no regard for other diners and it has really put us off ever visiting again  I am sure the manager was thinking of the money he would be getting from a large number of people  BUT if loud parties are allowed to book and permitted to make that row others will stay away  Shocking evening experience  
neutral; First time visited can only say one thing won t be going again    Waitress who served us was really good   helpful and palate    But she was training other girl so she was busy while other stuff was walking around pretending they was working   haven t had a table checked on us not once for the time we been there  quot hours quot  food was OK just average restaurant food nothing special and cocktails was horrible    Such a shame as u would think food be hight standards as its Jamie Oliver restaurant Won t recommend to anyone to go there and waist they money 
neutral; Not sure who s running this cafe the server denied it was Manchester city council  It s a great space to sit in  surrounded by busts of the great and good from Manchester s civic past  Unforgiveable  though  to have  quot Fairtrade Columbian ground decaffinated coffee quot  on the menu and then serve up a cafetiere of Nescafe instant decaff  The caffeine containing coffee was the real deal  mind  Toast looked like Sunblest  
neutral; Came here on a Thursday evening with my partner  He has previously been on a weekend and raved about it so booked a table for us to go a few weeks later   Firstly on our arrival they did not have any record of our booking but luckily had a table free anyway  The waitress was very nice and seated us immediately  however  it wasn t great that they had no record of the booking  luckily it wasn t a busy weekend   On arrival into the restaurant you enter the downstairs bar which looked very lively  lots of funky posters on the wall and art designs which give a niche feel  To get to the restaurant you go upstairs through a hidden door  by that I mean a door which blends in with the wallpaper   The restaurant its self is very nice  great layout and has the quirky feel  dim lights  candle lit tables and even has stuffed squirrels as side lights on the wall   Shame I didn t get a picture  it would make more sense    Service was great  very attentive without being over bearing  Barman brings over  glasses of water and ice without you even asking  Cannot fault this element whatsoever   Now let s move on to the equally important element the food  This was somewhat of a disappointment  The menu  if you can call it that  was tiny with a limited choice of food and same goes for the cocktail menu  The food is served on metal trays which ties in with the quirky theme which is fair enough but taste wise I would class as average  I ordered hot wings for starters which was very nice and full rack of ribs for my main with a bourbon sauce  They were okay  not very meaty and slightly dry had to ask the waitress for  extra pots of sauce to use to give them a bit more flavour  Of course the meal was served with the obligatory chips which were decent  I cannot comment on the desserts as I never looked at them   After the meal we went downstairs to the bar and had a couple of drinks which were cheap enough  Staff were pleasant and friendly and the atmosphere was great   I would defiantly go to the bar again and stay for a few drinks and to be fair I would go to the restaurant again but only on a weekend as my partner said he remembers them having much more choice on the weekend menu  As for a weekday I would give this place a miss  
neutral; I went with my partner for sunday lunch and must say it was not nice at all  I had a cajun chicken burger with coleslaw  The chicken burger and bun were supermarket quality and so was the coleslaw  Very sad food  No freshness  My husbands sunday roast was also not tasty   very bland   We didnt stay for desserts  
neutral;It s so sad  we used to love our take aways from Faulkners  The food has become oily  and heavy  not crunchy and light  Just a few mouthfuls leaves you feeling disgusting  How often are they changing the cooking oil  Not often enough  I suspect    Plus  they ve recently redecorated and it s lost all its charm 
neutral; Food was nice  arrived quickly   was hot but I do feel it was a bit overpriced for a mid week early bird menu  staff and atmosphere satisfactory  
neutral; Food was ok but staff were a joke  Ordered several things that didn t turn up  waited  mins for coffee + bill  Wasn t even busy  Would not go there again  
neutral; Enjoyed a night out with some friends who are local to the area  one friend had seen it on television and wanted to go  The waiter was very friendly and the service was great  We weren t that impressed with the mains  however the desserts more than made up for it    One friend was a vegetarian and there wasn t much choice for her  so she had a starter and some chips  which she did enjoy though  
neutral;Ate here over the Easter weekend  Whilst we enjoyed our food and found it to be good value  with the service also good  we would probably not visit again  It was way too noisy and busy for our taste  and we felt we were eating in a busy pub  which is what it is  rather than a restaurant  with people milling about all the time  No other complaints  just the ambience wasn t for us  so not likely to go back 
neutral;I met a friend here for dinner and took advantage of the fixed price menu for two courses   I was excited by the menu and the surroundings were nice   Unfortunately my oz rump steak was a huge let down  I like steak well done   I appreciate this isn t to everyone s taste but it s my preference and when done well is divine  Unfortunately my steak was incinerated   horribly tough and burnt even leaving a charcoal taste  The chips were soggy and lackluster  The saving grace was dessert   a lovely apple crumble   At   for food and one soft drink I was very disappointed 
neutral; We live in the area and are lucky to have a wonderful pub in our village of Bishopstone where we eat regularly  but we decided to drive to the Cross Keys as we had been to the opening event and have eaten there a few times before and had  had a lovely well priced meal When we arrived we were given a  specials  menu  course for   so we thought it sounded good so we all went for that menu  The portions were tiny  the chips were hard the risotto was bland and undercooked and the chocolate brownie with ice cream was served in a tumbler that s how small it was  If my  year old grandmother hasn t been with us we would have complained  however we reluctantly paid the  + bill and left  I ve told lots of people how nice the pub is as we always try to support local business but I won t be recommending it again  What went wrong   You did have it so right   
neutral; There is a good selection of food  Friendly and attentive staff  however  with their being a busy bar with loud music next to the restaurant  it was a bit too noisy in the restaurant  All our main courses were excellent  Having opted for deserts  rather than starters  i was disappointed to find that my  White Chocolate and Baileys tart  did not taste of Baileys at all  my friends all ordered the chocolate and caramel tarts and theirs DID taste of Baileys  slight mix up by the chef we reckoned  When pointing it out to the staff  they said they would check and came back telling me that it was definitely white chocolate and baileys and there was no baileys in the chocolate and caramel  I assured them there was no baileys in my desert  They did nothing to rectify it  would have been easy  and good service  to replace my desert with a fresh one with the correct ingredients   Hence my  stars  rather than  
neutral; Have visited the steak house many times now and always loved it but last night was a disappointment  We always book our table and were surprised to be stuck on the tiniest table ever  u couldn t get our drinks cutlery and plates on and be comfortable  yet a gentleman walked in without a booking behind us who was on his own and got seated on a table for  people    The food was amazing as usual can t fault it but our waitress was very over the top friendly and was making lots of mistakes around us  Its just a shame that the staff are not more organised the fact that we were squashed on the smallest table ever and could hardly move kind of spoilt our date night  
neutral; My boyfriend and I got a deal on bespoke offers and over all it was a good night   Very shabby chic and vintage effect however it was something different and novel   Food was typical american quick food but still good  Staff were ok however a little slow on the service side but we weren t in a rush   Film displayed was very good also  over all good   definitely would return  
neutral;The roast potato s no taste to them  The meat was lovely which was a shame the potato let the dinner down  That s why I have gave it  stars 
neutral; Been to a couple of weather spoon pubs recently for one reason or another  This is really middle of the road  Can t complain because nothing wrong but also nothing special   I ve had been cooking   rehearing and service from other pubs in the chain but also had a heck of a lot worse 
neutral; Had lunch at Cau Liverpool today  have been a few times before  Food was fab  staff were attentive  only problem s  were the slow service  it was not busy  and the little midgey flies hovering around our table    Arrrr    Only saying this so it gets sorted  the flies in particular   otherwise a really lovely place to eat and drink  
neutral; We booked for pm on a Friday  At this time the restaurant wasn t busy  Our food arrived within an expected waiting time  The food was nice  We used   of Tesco clubcard vouchers which I showed before we ordered our food   quot You have to pay for drinks  quot  we were told   I already knew this as I had read the t c s   I have to say the people were nice enough they just had an air of snobbishness  I m surprised waiters think they are superior to other people  The food and restaurant was of the same standard as Pizza Express and Zizzi s etc  but the prices were higher  E g   + for a typical dessert  We ended up paying   for our two drinks and a    tip  Not bad for a two course meal but I will use my vouchers more wisely next time  Don t think we will visit again  
neutral;We are local and haven t been to this establishment in a while  We called in this evening for dinner and enjoyed the food  It was of decent quality  However when the bill came we too  like other reviewers we were disappointed to see a % service charge already added  When we asked for this to be taken off the bill the young waitress that served us didn t know that this could be taken off and that we did not have to pay it  We would have left some cash  even though the waiter looked very scruffy with a few stains on his shirt but didn t think it was quite worthy of the %  We asked to speak to the manager however she insisted that we paid first  When leaving we mentioned to the manager that we did not wish to pay the service charge  He made us feel most unwelcome  He was very standoffish and argumentative when we said we hadn t seen it and the waitress had refused to take it off the bill for us  We left feeling very upset with this experience and we shall not be returning or recommending as this is not how you should deal with customers 
neutral; The dining experience here can vary but the service is quick  food varied and usually reasonably good  
neutral; the first hurdle was to book our living social voucher  Phoned on a Monday all day  noon and evening  same on Tuesday  checked website for opening hours   no information given on the website  In desperation I sent an e mail  not expecting an answer actually   got a reply from two people  confirming the booking  but insisting that the opening hours are on the website   which they are not  Also the online booking form leaves you puzzled  it actually refers back to a company in Essex  Anyway food was good  just wish they would have served something with the dishes other than the decorative salad  e g  bread  I left you feeling that you ate a row of starters  rather than a main meal  I did have meze before  so knew what to expect   
neutral; Popped in for a late lunch with my daughter and her two children  Not child friendly  Didn t like the layout  in total there aren t that many places to sit  Food was expensive  Very small bowl of chips for most of them inedible   I was totally disappointed with the place  Must have spent a fortune refurbishing it  but I won t be returning  
neutral; Hi Colman s is a good fish and chip shop but a bit expensive if you want to just get fish and chips try Greenlanefishshop you can get fresh crab  And prawns cooked at this fish shop when in session   My money is on this chippy 
neutral; Recently moved to the Isle of Sheppey and thought we would try some of the restaurants  The refurbished Crooked Billett  part of the Shurland Hotel  were offering a % discount on food so we gave it a try  Sadly we were disappointed  The Restaurant was more like a canteen  very basic  We had a view overlooking the courtyard and church  would have been perfect but for the overladen ashtray outside the window  which could not have been emptied for weeks  The waiting staff  apart from one young girl  must have have frontal labotomies  No character  just very dull  The food was mediocre but I have to say my steak was excellent  They need some character to the place  some soft music and some big plants or something to give you privacy  No different to a little Chef sadly  
neutral; We stopped off for lunch in the beautiful village of Hurley and decided on the lovely looking The Olde Bell  The experience started off very promisingly with the very helpful barman providing excellent customer service and we ordered a Ploughmans  for me  and smoked salmon sandwich for my husband  We then went and sat in the fabulous garden  Our food turned up fairly promptly and I was presented with a Ploughmans on a narrow wooden chopping board  I love Ploughmans but was a little surprised by this one  A small pile of mixed leaves  no dressing    lumps of ham one of which was the end of the ham   thin pieces of slightly dry bread  both from the end of the loaf   slices of apple   slices of tomato  a blob of piccalilli   thick slices of very nice cheddar and a dish of what were lovely olives   There was no butter  I had to ask for cutlery and as soon as I tried to cut anything it fell off the board and the tomatoes shot into my lap   The ham had no flavour and was very fatty so I had to trim it to get at the meat  I soon ran out of and asked my husband who had finished his sandwich  which he said was nice but again no dressing on the mixed leaves or any additional like a slice of cicumber tomato and a few crisps  if he could go and ask for some more bread as there was not a member of staff to be seen  When he had not returned after mins I started to read my Kindle  my cheese was starting to sweat in the sun but I did not want to eat it all as he had made the effort to get me some extra bread  He returned empty handed  saying there was noone to ask  the bar staff tied up with customers and no with staff to be seen with the bell in the kitchen ringing and ringing for food to be collected   soon there were staff busy bringing out plates of food to customers so there had clearly been a back log of food  I finished my cheese without any more dry bread and we shortly left very disappointed  It was not cheap and although the staff were very pleasant  the food that we had was very average and should have been better  It is a beautiful pub in a beautiful location  a little more effort on the food and it would have been worth every penny  Would we return  for a drink yes for food no we wouldn t  
neutral; We enjoyed an anniversary dinner  the food was tasty freshly cooked to a high standard  The waiter was very attentive and made us feel welcome   The resturant itself needs an overhaul  the decor is very poor and the was a damp musty smell  This is a huge shame as if the decor matched the meal I m sure you would be hard pushed to get table  
neutral; Ideal for feeding hungry teenagers  Wide ranging menu and the quality is good  Offers often available  Nice surroundings  It close to a park and the staff were happy to let us bring a dog into one part of the pub  which is large  
neutral; The good:   The food tasted ok  if it had been cooked better it would have been an enjoyable meal    Nice view of the Marina Staff were polite and friendly    The bad:    Flies Our table was not ready despite us having a reservation We were put on the table by the toilets to wait    The risotto botellino: more of an oily soup with occasional mouthfuls of grit from the shellfish  Disappointing as it could have been really nice  
neutral; I visited in the summer with a friend for coffee and cake after having a few lovely visits to the Nottingham store  I have to say we were disappointed mainly with the couldn t care less attitude of some of the staff    Anyway  We ended up in the Westfield a few weeks ago and really fancied some cake  We thought we would give it another go  and I m glad we did  We definitely noticed an improvement  and were very impressed with how the manager was looking after the customers including us  it was a male manager whose name was Dave or Dan  something beginning with a D  Anyway I am pleased to say it looks like its on the way up  so I will definitely be returning  hurray   although maybe not so good for my waistline    
neutral; Decided to take Grandma for her birthday  Service was a bit slow   it was a very quiet evening  Food was good but overall quite pricey we thought  Pleasant but nothing unique or special  
neutral;Two of us had a quick dinner there on a late Tuesday evening  Only a few tables were occupied  We got the usual complimentary small dishes of kimchi and picked veg  We had one of the classics  rice with beef and veg in a stone bowl and also the mackerel pike kimchi stew  The food was tasty and the service was quick and with a smile  We had the traditional barley tea but some of the other tables were on more serious stuff  so all tastes are catered for  Will go back for a quick dinner some time in the future:  
neutral; Like a weatherspoons but double triple the price  Wouldn t recommend or go again  Had steak which was Ok but still cost around   for an average meal  
neutral; We booked after reading the reviews and found the food to be excellent  the restaurant was attractive and extremely busy as it was Friday evening  We rated value for money as average as comparable restaurants in our home town  Solihull  offer complementary desserts  coffee with liqueur and sweets  
neutral;Food was hot  Plenty of choice  Plenty of it  Service was really good  Lacked atmosphere  Kids loved it 
neutral; Sadly let down by shocking service  The waitress messed up my order and managed to take down the wrong main  Ordered Chicken Mushroom Pie and got bought Chicken and Bacon Burger   This meant I had to watch my partner eat    luckily she offered me her chips :  When the Pie did turn up though it was delicious  save for the watery vegetables    Was a slight wait on food  perhaps down to it was a busy Saturday night  The manager voided off my dinner as compensation   which for me was warranted  The service wasn t fantastic  a change over of staff and lack of communication I feel was down to this  However perhaps on a Saturday night they should look at employing two members of dedicated staff   one on bar and one on the floor   especially as they advertise table service at no extra cost    I wouldn t rule out going again as perhaps on another night it could be rated  out of   Very reasonable priced food for what it was  Would recommend   even after our experience  Would be interested to see if we were just unlucky  
neutral; Really nice location: by the river  but too crowded when it s sunny  so if you want to have a table  do not forget to book in advance    As well  this place is better to have drinks than to eat  Drinks are good and cheap  whereas the food is really not good value for money   I had the head of the river burger : the bread was dry and the meat really overcooked 
neutral; Food was very nice  Service was very average  staff were not very friendly  none of them looked happy and one had a slightly cocky attitude when we asked where one of our plates was which we did not like  
neutral; If you are looking for healthy  organic food  this is a place to consider   however I would recommend Willow in Totnes  if you are looking for an excellent vegetarian or vegan meal  The service at Joshua s is okay  but could be better  and the food isn t always as good as it should be  given the prices   If  however  you are just looking for a place to buy interesting nick nacks  or fresh produce  this shop has what you want  Their range of pre cooked chilled and frozen food is usually very good  but I don t rate their venison dishes  the game sauces frequently fail the taste bud test   
neutral; The scrambled egg and salmon   literally speaks for itself  Delicious  A bit of a decor uplift and table service could make it into a true Chester hotspot for brunch  But I would still definitely describe it as a  diamond in the rough  
neutral; Starting with the positives: Attentive service  good food  good room for a large party  However  we felt there were several things that were not right  Firstly  value for money   at   per head for food  we would have expected side vegetables to be included  this was not the case and infact they cost an additional   each    Secondly  despite asking for the drinks bill to be made separately for alcohol and soft drinks it was not done and so made it difficult to sort out at the end of the night when some people had already left    Thirdly  the wine glasses were just topped up making it impossible for us to know how much wine was consumed  so we had to take the bill as being correct even though there was no way of us checking this   i have been stung before in a different restaurant who slipped on the bill another cocktail which wasn t ordered Fourthly  we had declined the offer of teas and coffees prior to the evening  but the waiters still offered these and it was not made clear to people that the cost was extra to the   already paid    Fifthly  a  % service charge was added without consent  we were aware that we should have queried this at the time  but we just wanted to settle up and go at the end of the night  I believe that the service charge should be for the customer to decide on what they are happy to give for good service after the bill has been settled    The waiter wasn t keen to wrap the slices of cake that i asked him for  and he made a fuss about doing that even though he had already done one slice a few minutes before  and he also didn t bring the cake candle decoration back with the slices  so i would not have given that much of a tip to be honest    It s all obviously to make the restaurant as much money as possible  and being in central London we do expect to pay high prices  but felt they were over inflated  even for London  I do not feel like we got value for money here for a cup of tea   and the food although nice didn t justify   plus per head    We will definitely not be returning  
positive; The restaurant is centrally situated in Ashton and car parking is good  The decor is to a high standard and this would be a good place for an event  The food was good  as you would expect in an upmarket Italian restaurant  The staff were very attentive although were bordering on being intrusive  The restaurant was busy on the Sunday evening we were there with many people celebrating birthdays  The downsides for me was that it was quite noisy and the prices were on the high side  We will probably go again as this is one of the best in Tameside  
positive; Had dinner here while the England vs Wales game was on  Great atmosphere  Plenty of different seating arrangements depending on whether you want to sit at a table and have something to eat or just relax and have a drink  Good outside seating area too overlooking the canal   We had food as well as drinks and everyone enjoyed what they had chosen  Crackling and burgers were both great  One small disappointment was that there were no more  quot chicken on a beer can quot  left due to it being such a busy evening but we ll be back again to try that  
positive; We had a few meals here  the last one was a Sunday roast  the portions are fairly large  I had the pork which was tender and tasty  Tables are a little jammed in on a Sunday  but well worth the visit  
positive; Lunch on a sunny warm day outside  Lovely relaxed ambience  Huge menu  and all four of us chose something different  and every dish was delicious and beautifully presented  No pressure to rush through lunch  and it was a really happy get together  
positive; We stumbled out of the train station into this place  The welcome from Tom  I think it was  was really friendly and helpful  There was a lunchtime deal which made the food really really reasonable  I can t remember the exact price as a few weeks ago now but it was really very cheap  The food was basic pub food but done well  served promptly and good value  They deserve to do well  
positive; My husband and I visited here with our dog on a mini honeymoon  we were on our way to Wicken Fen nature Reserve and thought it looked picturesque when driving past so decided to stop  We took our dog and sat in the rear garden  we were all made to feel welcome  We shared a starter platter and then I had the lamb burger which was delicious  good quality meat and a tasty homemade salsa type topping and my husband had jacket potato with chilli  Portions were generous and nicely presented with side salads etc  There was a water bowl for dogs but as it was so sunny we couldn t have stayed in the garden much longer as there was no shade for our dog to lay in  This is no fault of the pubs though and something that couldn t be altered  the garden was beautiful and a good size  One small touch to note  I visited the lady s toilet and there was a basket stocked with ladies toiletries for emergency use eg deodorant hairspray etc  I thought this was such a caring touch and something I hadn t seen before  
positive; Always good  friendly and attentive service  reasonable prices    one of our local favourites  They always seem to be able to fit us in without reservations which counts for a lot in our book  
positive; Meal was adequate  but insufficient vegetables  and when we asked for more we were informed that there would be an extra charge  There was  in our part and the vegetables provided would have barely been adequate for two persons 
positive;This is our second time at this Tea Room   the first  a couple of years ago  we missed the homemade quiche etc   When it s gone  it s gone   This time we arrived at the Tearoom at    we were seated promptly  however my friend was feeling the full force of the draft every time the front door was opened  Another table became free and we asked to be moved  this didn t go down well   I don t know why  as it was a polite request was made  We had already ordered our lunch   two quiches and salad   about half an hour later we were told that because we had changed tables one portion of quiche had been sold  so there was only one left  We ordered soup instead  about  minutes later we were told that too had all gone   what a muddle  My friend had the quiche and I ordered scrambled eggs and salmon  The food was very pleasant  the range of teas extensive and very good  but I think the service left a bit to be desired  Why should our change of table have affected our order  I should have asked that question at the time  but didn t  I m not sure I would go back 
positive;Have come to Favoloso a few times now and every time the sundaes are delicious  Great selection for reasonable prices  Cannot believe though in  they still do not have a card machine  It s pretty ridiculous  and the nearest cash machines which do not charge for withdrawal are about a  min walk away  so be aware of this  Alternatively the pub opposite has a machine which charges  The decor and feel of Favoloso  down to the menus  is SO dated  but I actually think that makes it cute and unique  and would hope this doesn t change  Highly recommend  a must if you re in Eastbourne and after some ice cream 
positive; This is my local restaurant  I live across the road and have been coming here for about  years  During that time  it s been through various changes of ownership  The original lady owner and her daughters established a gold plated reputation  bringing back spices from Ethiopia on a regular basis  Now  Abyssinia is back to its origins  and standards are good  Menus are available in English  Ethiopian and Eritrean  reflecting some culinary overlaps in these cultures  I m ashamed to say that I don t remember the precise names of many dishes  But I can tell you that the red lentil dish  the yellow lentil dish  the collard greens  the cubed lamb dish and the chicken with a boiled egg in a hellishly spicy sauce are terrific  
positive;Fully refurbished  a lovely venue  Our table overlooked the canal  You need to book  its very popular and we had been previously unsuccessful without booking  Menu is good and there are daily specials  Unfortunately my soup was cold  but this was heated quickly and very good  Lamb kleftiko delicious  We found the food to be really excellent  with generous portions  but rather expensive  Our waitress  Crystal  was exceptional  with service discreet and unhurried but always responsive  A special occasion type of restaurant and i would recommend 
positive; Not haute cuisine but a very good menu  something there for even the pickiest eater  Best of all  there s a smaller appetite section  which is perfect for ensuring your skirt still fits you at the end of the holiday  Friendly staff  reasonable prices  tasty food  and a very nice glass of cabernet sauvignon  Not bad at all  
positive; We had roast lunch  consecutive Sunday s as we were staying close by  It is advisable to book as it is very busy  We visited in October  There was a choice of  meats or you could have all   They also offer a small portion for those with a smaller appetite or if you want to save room for pud  Staff very attentive  pleasant surroundings  
positive; I was recommended this restaurant several times by friends  We had relatives come to visit so decided to try it out  From the outside  it doesn t appear to be anything spectacular  but the exterior is highly deceiving  The restaurant is simply decorated and the open kitchen is a great feature  The menu is varied  with an option to suit everyone  incl  Gluten free   The food was incredible   I had the Sticky Honey Pork  which I would highly recommend  If you re a fan of Asian food and sushi  you must visit   It s a shame the service really let it down  Our waiter seemed incredibly short with us  lacked any manners  and was extremely irritable throughout our visit  The kitchen staff seem really friendly   if only the waiter possessed the same charm  
positive; Tried this pub based on fellow trip advisor reviews and I am glad we did   It is a great pub with super friendly staff and good food all at reasonable prices  
positive; It s a good family pub  Real ale is excellent as brewed on the premises  The food is good basic  grub  which isn t too expensive  Its always busy  
positive;We went into Pizza Hut before we saw the new Bond Movie Skyfall  Very nice food  friendly service  delicious pizza and refreshing drinks  great place to go  Nice environment would deffinitely go there again :   Thank you for reading  :  I hope you found this review helpful : 
positive;We stayed next door at The Mill House and went for lunch before our flight  Gorgeous food and Louise our waitress was warm  chatty and helpful  I cannot fault it  My next stay at The Mill House will include a return visit here also  Go and eat Jere you will not be disappointed 
positive; Had Sunday lunch  very tasty  lamb shank tender  chicken very tasty menu did stated chicken to share for  people  only enough for two people   Good atmosphere  children there but didn t notice them as place is so big  Service very good  we had a very friendly waiter  If you want to go somewhere different definitely the place to go 
positive;We go to massala room quite often due to us having a high life card so its  for   We enjoy it   for curries in this area its one of the best  I dont know how anyone else feels but most restaurants pull there face at the high life card  even though they choose to be on it  but not massala room  The tell us to come back with it  Brilliant  Fantastic friendly service  Food is amazing  I just wouldnt recommend the chicken tikka massala   as its abit bland and nothing like tikka massala  Other than that its brilliant    Especially the pashwari naan 
positive; Party of  at the beginning of December   allocated a private room upstairs which was brilliant  Preordered food a week before so pub very organised  Room was newly refurbished so lovely vibe   however some music would have added to the night    Food was of a good standard but came on dribs and drabs and some people has finished before there s had arrived  My main dish was  pounds but had no side dishes which I thought was alittle price my however the steaks looked amazing    Would visit again 
positive; Central location  good grub  plenty of ales  nice people  Oh and excellent value too  What s not to like    
positive;Really great burgers and served very quickly  If you like a burger you can t go wrong with this place 
positive; Decor Entertainment Service   Attended a birthday party with of us our starter was a selection of mini dishes  Servings was sufficient for us all loved the little briefing our waiter gave us before we excitedly consumed our starter    The main dish was a very impressive portion I had salmon with almond mash and asparagus  see pics  others had Lamb shank and Chicken with I believe mashed potato respectively  although not entirely sure More than likely the best salmon I have ever had  Succulent   Only downside the meals are set dessert selection was not so impressive however after the constant supply of bread we didn t want dessert    Generally everyone was pleased with the meal and the live opera singing  Maybe offer us the lyrics as they sing so we can all sing along next time    
positive; Great little bar in the Arcadian centre near china town an the Hippodrome  Made even better by their half price drinks offer between  an pm   The evening we were there was lovely an warm so we sat out an listened to the free live music playing from the glee club  Menu there is also reasonable with  for   meals   
positive; Enjoyable meal to celebrate my mid week birthday  We received good service from our waitress  The food was hot and tasty  And the kids tried new foods which is always a bonus    
positive; My husband and I stumbled across this restaurant whilst trying to get away from the crowds during the Giants Spectacular in Liverpool    We sat at a table outside and studied the menu on the wall  I was surprised to realise it was a vegetarian  vegan and gluten free restaurant  We re both meat eaters and I m fussy  particularly when it comes to vegetables  but I m glad we stayed as we weren t disappointed   Inside  it s larger than you would expect and had shabby chic style decor which really suited the place  The staff are extremely friendly and take your order at the bar  There s a real variety of meals to choose from  not your usual veggie option of cheese and onion pie in sight  I opted for nachos and received a huge bowl full topped with chick peas in a tomato sauce  sour cream  salsa and jalapenos  all for washed down with a traditional Curiosity Cola  My husband tried the field mushroom burger served on a bun with halloumi cheese  tomato and lettuce with a side of potato wedges for    He said it was the best burger he d ever had   and he s tried a lot of burgers  They re licensed too and have live music  I d highly recommend this little gem  even if you re not vegetarian  
positive; Can for a meal with a girly friend  food was much better than other main stream italian restaurants and was a great atmosphere for a chat and a few glasses of wine  I would definitely go back  
positive; The food was faultless  the wine was nice  The staff were friendly   knowledgeable  but they seemed to struggle at busy times  
positive; Visited the Unity Brook Tavern on the th July as we had been advised that it was under new management  We were surprised at the extensive and varied menu  but because we were all so hungry we plumped for something traditional  My husband and his sister went for the steak   ale pie with home made chunky chips and mushy peas  and I went for the home made cheese   onion pie with the same accompaniments  Everything was delicious  the steak in the pie melted in your mouth  as did the light puff pastry topper  and there was no fat or gristle to be found  My cheese   onion pie was every bit as delicious and the home made chips were cooked to perfection   best pub meal we ve had for ages  we would highly recommend a visit  The pub doesn t look much externally  but the atmosphere is warm   friendly  the staff are courteous and I would advise anyone to give it a try   Shirley from Over Hulton 
positive; After a couple of hours spent in the V and A we were ready for a meal and not really knowing nearby restaurants opted for this Italian as on an early Saturday evening it had a couple of tables free   We were perhaps lucky to find one reading other reviews   The food was delicious  I had risotto which was certainly beautifully cooked   The pizzas are big but according to people with me very well cooked  It s a small place and the tables are fairly close together but we certainly enjoyed our meal and will visit again  It s very close to the South Kensington museums which is another plus factor  Not so keen on having service charge of % added on  
positive;On the Waterfront was not my first choice for somewhere to have my rd birthday  Going by some of the reviews on here  i was all for giving it a wide birth  however  by recommendation  i decided to give it a go  Firstly  the  Long room  was heaving  It was a busy Saturday night  th Jan  and the busier the restaurant  the happier i tend to be  go where people clearly enjoy the food  would be dead in there otherwise  there is a quieter room for smaller tables if busy is not your thing  The good parts: being as the table was so large  fifteen of us to be specific  they handled the volume quite well  The food came out on time  and correctly  the drinks where kept on top of  and the atmosphere was fantastic  The food tasted nice  we had pizzas  pastas  steaks and fish  All where of a good standard   Between the  of us  we shared the massive    desserts  Both of which where yummy  My father wanted to pay for all of the tables drinks  desserts and my parents meals  which a staff member did quickly and without fuss leaving my table to pay for their individual meals  For  people it came to around    The bad parts: I say bad  but really its just a few small points  The Becks was flat  it really didnt taste nice  i did let the staff members know and they apologised which was nice  The staff in general where friendly  but the odd one or two where not great  almost rude actually  which is a huge shame as it almost cast a shadow on the service i received up to that point  Being in hospitality myself  even when its busy  you cant be rude to the customer and i felt one or two where  I dont know if thats a support issue from management  or the people in question are just rude in general    The girl who took my drinks order  she said it was her first day  and the guy who split the bill for me  tattoos on his upper arms  where very friendly indeed and i couldnt fault them :   Would i come again  YES : 
positive; Visited for a work christmas party of   Lovely starters with vegetarians and non spice eaters catered for  Plentiful and varied main dishes including  chicken  lamb  prawn and more vegetarian options with lots of different rices and naan bread side dishes Everything was piping hot and delicious  The waiters were fabulous on a really busy night when the restaurant was full to capacity  Very impressed  
positive;Stopped here for pizza with friends on our way home  The place was clean and the food was tasty  losing one star tho  after a member of staff informed me where I live  Cumbria  The Lake District is NOT the north and he was being very serious bless
positive; Food from around the world  Have been many times with friends and thoroughly enjoyed the food and particularly good for family  My father is a strictly meat    veg and enjoyed the roast beef with veg and loved the desert choices  My grandchildren like tasting different food and I enjoy on spot cooking  There has always been a relaxed atmosphere  At busy times it is advisable to make a booking  
positive; My partner and I visited this restaurant on a whim and we were very pleased with our meal  The food was authentic and tasty  We haven t been back yet but I am sure we will be  
positive; Visited TGI Friday s Wembley with my mu on Tuesday th July   A quite evening  but our food was waiting on the pass for  minutes    a waitress came over and asked if we ordered and we d said yes  to which she replied  quot Oh actually I think it s ready now quot   She then gave us our food  which was still hot surprisingly  and after that was very attentive with refilling our drinks  asking if our meal was okay etc  We ordered the French Canadian burger  lovely Chicken and Shrimp  a side of sweet potato fries which were tasty   diet cokes and a large Popcorn Sundae  The bill came to    which was good but I think some of the choices on the menu are overpriced    However  the menu offers an excellent choice of options  as well as a great cocktail menu which will suit everyone s tastes    Nice meal  
positive; Great food here  prices not too bad  well worth getting a loyalty card  you get some great discounts  Only slight niggle was I felt there were not enough staff on that night and the waitresses looked a bit rushed and forgot a couple of things  With more staff it would have been perfect  
positive;Went at lunchtime on a very rainy Monday waiting for my daughters duke of Edinburgh ceremony  Couldn t ask for better  Good atmosphere  good service and tasty food 
positive; Read the reviews before we visited which were a little mixed so you never quite know what you are going to find but so glad we went   The menu is not extensive but it does have a few dishes you would not normally find  Bit disappointed the dish we wanted was sold out and we had to reorder  The food was very tasty and well presented although the well done steak was not cooked as requested    The waiting team were very efficient and friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were happy   Loved the decor a mix of retro and modern  There are  seating areas one downstairs and one upstairs both equally as attractive  Dependent on the weather there is also an outside area    Small negatives were it was quite expensive and parking could be an issue an a busy night as it is close to other venues   Many more positives than negatives  Read the menu online and give it a try  We did and would visit again  
positive; We had a staff reunion celebration here on Tuesday  and an engagement announcement  It was an early supper so we kept it pretty light  The vegetarian chickpea tagine was delicious  and the sausages went down a treat  Staff were helpful in providing a high chair for small child  It s a bit pricier than Cotes  which we all love  but made a stylish change  
positive; Nice tea rooms  Full English was nice for    but they did not do kids version of breakfast unfortunatley   missing a trick there  Although there were a couple of lunch options for them  the only other breakfast choice was sausage bap or a bacon bap  Cakes were very nice  
positive; Good food  Extensive menu to eat in or takeaway  Friendly staff  If you like your food really hot make sure you labour the point  I asked for my meal to be vindaloo hot but was served a lot milder than I would normally eat  Was nice though so not a problem   
positive;Booked this restaurant on the recommendation of its tripadvisor ranking around the Exeter area  Faultless from start to finish  We were shown straight to our table  even though we were  minutes early  and the restaurant was busy  Given ample time to view Sunday set menu and also the specials board  We plumped for roast lamb and apricot sage stuffed chicken  Both were very tasty and came with larger than average portions of roast potatoes and vegetables as sides  and extra gravy too    Dessert board showed various appetising choices and we decided on the Apple and Pecan Butter pudding and Vanilla Tart with Summer Fruit compote  Both delicious  Can t fault the service of either the owner or the waiting staff  friendly and attentive   We did not feel rushed at all  We will most definitely be back at some point  N B  Check SatNav route before setting off as ours took us through little country lanes  On the way back we found the B an easier route  which was a  larger  road to drive 
positive; Three of us had excellent meals  The chicken tikka was particularly succulent and a duck dish excellent  We had two keep warm hotplates which meant that nothing went lukewarm as we ate  The restaurant is immaculate inside  the service was kindly and efficient and we know people who come from  miles away to enjoy the Gandhi food  
positive; This restaurant has a nice interior and comfortable seating  The service is impeccable  which is unusual for this area  and the menu extensive  The wine choices are also good  the food was lovely  well presented  tasty and plentiful  The only slight downside is that is not cheap  whilst still not being very expensive  I guess you really do get what you pay for here  
positive; Six of us had lunch here and all of our six different meals were very good  Homemade tasty and nicely presented  Service was speedy and very friendly  I had the crab and salad  It was a very large portion of a very good salad drawn crab and bread and butter  Excellent  It is definately worth visiting again when we are in the area  
positive; A Sunday trip with the family lead to a variety of food options landing at the table   All in all everyone enjoyed the feast  service was good and attentive  Value would have been the issue had it not been for the voucher offer    saving  which brought in back into expectations  Will be back  though probably when next set of vouchers arrive 
positive; What a pleasant relaxing spot for lunch on a sunny day    The staff were very attentive and friendly  one of the best burgers I ve had  cooked to perfection  one portion of fries and coleslaw is enough for two people  and I tried a couple of interesting lagers too    
positive; Good food  good atmosphere  lovely service  Portions were big and tasty and children were treated with politeness  We enjoyed it  
positive; we have been going to Almas in Dore  probably since it opened  years or so  We went on Saturday night with our usual friends who live in the place  I don t know why but I never thought about writing a review until today  Saturday night was as good as ever great service and great food  Many people have said that the restaurant is expensive  It is if you compair to a standard indian restaurant but this is not a standard Indian restaurant  It is fine dining  Yes they serve onion barjees and chicken madras  which are excellent but they serve other supurb Indian dishes that you do not find on menus down London Road of Attercliffe  If you love Indian food and want something special then look no further go to Almas  Just one slight negative  A recent review mentioned there was no atmosphere  I agree Saturday night was not very busy and we all commented how quite it was  This is not so much a reflection on the restaurant but more a reflection on the economy  
positive; st visit here and would visit again great menu and good service  
positive; A hidden gem on the edge of town  Good lunch for   burger   roast beef sandwich  tasty   generous portions  friendly staff  very well kept real ale  local Flack Manor  Tunns   Bath Ales Gem  Would like to sample the evening menu   atmosphere  
positive; Having just moved into the area  this is the first Indian restaurant we have tried  and we weren t at all disappointed  An extensive menu  which also has an array of vegetarian dishes  The Tarka dal was amazing  we should have had it as a main  we will next time  I had the vegetable thali which was lovely and my husbands had the house special biryani  There was a good selection in the thali  all of the dishes were made using fresh ingredients  no tinned purÇ¸ed spinach in the sauce  My only comment would be  was all the dishes had the same sauce  or if it wasn t the same  they were highly similar  The biryani according to my husband was also lovely  although that had a very red colouring to the rice  something we haven t encountered before in a biriani dish  Since we had a takeaway  all I can comment on about service is that it was highly professional and quick  A great first impression  and we will be going back to try some more dishes  
positive; The food isn t special but is a lot better than any other  pub grub    Good place for a work get together  a catch up with friends or to relax after a shopping spree  Very cheap but not poor quality  
positive; Have been here a few times with the hubby and the service has always been warm and friendly   we ve been seated quickly and always made to feel welcome   even when we ve dropped in quite late for supper  Food is fresh and tasty  the kebabs are amazing  Highly recommended  
positive; On Bold Street  in Liverpool lies a hidden Italian gem  Cafe Latino  Serving delicious and well presented dishes  in a modern and well designed restaurant  customers can relax whilst admiring the view of the bustling street below  It is welcoming with friendly staff and quick service   Cafe Latino has been open for  years now  owner Emilio Lotrecchio explains  The menu is clear and well priced  offering quick bites  ideal for busy shoppers or authentic Italian dishes    I sampled the goats cheese  which I can honestly say is excellent  creamy but with a kick  My brother went for the garlic pizza  great size and again tasty  We left satisfied  full and singing their praises   I would highly recommend this beautiful restaurant to students  as it is value for money  and screams style and sophistication   Relax with a coffee and take in the view at Cafe Latino  
positive; We have to eat here every time we are in harrods Food is very nice    Cakes are scrummy  especially the sweet that is shaped in a rose  It is so heavenly very addictive I can never eat it all as it is so filling  So naughty very high calorific value but if you can afford the extra calories  And still fit in those skinny jeans its must   oh you have to love white chocolate too    go on treat yourself if you are ever here 
positive;Nipped in here for a quick pick me up in the afternoon   we had cream tea and it was delicious  Can t beat a warm scone with cream and jam  much nicer than some of the mass produced things you can buy  Staff were polite   didn t have much dealing with them really other than ordering 
positive; As a fans of the restaurant for around a year we have been here around six times for a family meal often to celebrate something like good news or a birthday etc and I went there yesterday and had a pizza called the Smokin Pig Pizza which had: delicious sweet BBQ pulled pork  smokey cheddar cheese  a healthy amount of mozzarella cheese and refreshing pea shoots  sweetcorn and pineapple pieces served on a thin crust perfectly cooked pizza  It actually brought a tear to my eye when I realized that I had probably eaten the most delicious and most value for money pizza in my lifetime   It also seemed to be a healthier option because it was made fresh and even with the cheddar cheese it would have contained less fat than a normal  processed pizza which would have been of a lesser quality  The pulled pork was also good enough to be served as a regular meal which was a great change to pizzas from other restaurants which had toppings of an inferior quality  Great service and perfect food every time  Another triumph Little Pizza Kitchen  please never get rid of the Pizza that is so dear to me and my Brother  
positive; I had always wanted to go into Hard Rock Cafe and I am so glad I did  Me  my family and friend enjoyed our food and drink here so much  I thought it was a nice touch that if you ordered the bigger size cocktail you get to keep the glass :  which was very nice  The staff was very friendly  We was shown to a table very quickly too  The only thing I would say wasn t very professional was the person waiting on our table didn t write our order down  Other then that Hard Rock Cafe was faultless 
positive;We go very regular here as we have a caravan locally   we have a daughter under    There s always other kids families   the meal is always of a consistent quality  Cannot find a fault 
positive; The corn dogs are amazing  but everything is quite pricey which is a downside  Sadly the chicken wings were quite oily and the pulled pork on my friends burger very dry  but overall always a good visit  
positive; I have recently been to Wahaca and the food is authentic Mexican and taste is really good and the ambiance is gr 
positive; The food as always is lovely  well cooked and plentiful  The staff are helpful and service is quick  However the let down here falls to the bathroom  The ladies stalls do not lock which means a balance act of sitting and shoving foot against the door to keep your dignity  the toilets do not flush well and need to be jiggled to successfully flush in both male and female  aside from that a great dining experience  
positive;Really good value  all you can eat for a tenner  The food is freshly prepared  there was loads of choice  Eat as much or as little as you like  The Thai seafood was especially good 
positive; We visited Cholaas on a Sunday afternoon and were initially the only people in the restaurant   although some other diners arrived during the course of our meal  some of whom were Asian  which I always take as a good sign  The surroundings are very  quot blingy quot  and opulent and the owners obviously take great pride in their attention to detail  Our waiter was very attentive and did very well as he appeared to be the only one working  The drinks service was very quick and we had one of the nicest bottles of wine we ve had for a long time  The food service wasn t quite as quick  but our popadoms were delicious and arrived fairly quickly  The menu is varied and has some unusual dishes  almost like a fusion between Indian and Chinese  such as black pepper chicken  My only criticism is that the menu does not explain what exactly the dishes are  so we had to ask the waiter  but he was very happy to explain  When it did arrive  the food was excellent and well worth waiting for  The portion size was just right  I would definitely return here  All in all a pleasant dining experience  
positive; Keith was very friendly  made us very welcome  Food was lovely and fresh and cooked to high standard  very quick  efficient service  didn t have to wait long at all and pub was busy at time we visited  
positive; This pub restaurant is five mins from my home so I visit regular   It s not cheap in fact can turn out to be an expensive visit but it is definitely worth the visit if like me you like a steak  They cook steaks just our you like them and they melt in your mouth with every bite you take    They have other items like fish and chicken and have a reasonable vegetarian selection but it s the steak that makes the place providing you don t mind waiting for a table in some cases for an hour or longer as you can t book on certain nights and can get very busy so be warned    Note if you sign up for their free news letter you get voucher offers on occasions which can include a free drink or desert   Take a visit  I m sure you won t be disappointed  
positive; At the last minute we decided to take the family for a Sunday lunch  The staff who answered the phone was very helpful and friendly and accommodated our booking as we wanted a table within half and hour of phoning with space for a pram  We arrived and could chose our table  The waitress was very efficient and got us drinks and took our order  The food arived very quickly    of us had chicken which was half a chicken  which was a bit too much for us to eat  My grandson had steak which he enjoyed very much   good value for money  
positive;We had a very enjoyable dinner at Gusto mid week  The big warehouse room has a lot of character with brick walls and arched ceiling and iron pillars  Tables were well spaced and service very professional   It is busy and we found it best to pace the service by ordering in stages  other wise the meal could be over too quickly   Everything from snacks with cocktails to pizzas was very well cooked and this looked to be a kitchen with a sure touch  Good value  nice busy atmosphere and enjoyable food  highly recommend 
positive; Had been looking forward to this treat for our son s birthday for some time    didn t quite live up to expectation but was still enjoyable  I liked the  quot Shard quot  type feeling overlooking the city and it was certainly lively but in my honest opinion it was a little over priced  food and drinks  and rushed  you have the table for a nominated time only   I found booking a table experience quite daunting having tried to book both online and by telephone which left me frustrated as I could not actually speak to someone about my requirements  Anyway  I ve been there and done that now 
positive; We live just around the corner and visit fairly often  Staff range from incredibly helpful and polite to quite rude  The menu is excellent value and the food is always hot and good  I ve never had a bad meal here  The wines are good and reasonably priced too  We will continue to eat here  although I d go somewhere else at the weekend  It gets very busy  because of the prices and handy location  
positive; Stopped for a very late lunch  Liver was excellent and prawn spaghetti was full of flavour and perfectly cooked  Service was excellent  The bar was very quiet but this is when service can often Slip  We were warmly greeted  Order taken promptly  The waiter checked we were enjoying our food  Would recommend as good value for the quality  
positive; average food  average service  nothing special  but would go at lunch rather than evening 
positive; Nice  quiet pubs can be hard to come by in the heart of the West End  let alone located on London s most famous shopping street  but The Tottenham  opposite Tottenham Court Road tube station is a great find   The upper floor is very cosy and traditional looking  softly lit with mahogany benches with stools and a few tables with quaint wooden and leather banquettes  The staff were friendly  Tables were plentiful around    pm but quickly filled up later with the after work crowd  However  there was plenty of space in the downstairs restaurant area  where you have to go if you order a meal  It s not as cosy or nicely furnished as upstairs  but we were starving  so finding a table easily was a blessed relief  Our food turned up incredibly quickly   probably not more than ten minutes after ordering  if that  The downside was that both my burger and the bacon in it were overcooked and tasted burnt  However  I could tell all the food was fresh and good quality  with lots of big juicy tomatoes and lettuce  so I imagine it was one off  The chips were great   The food was quite well priced for central in London  about   for a burger  and the menu was extensive  packed British classics including options you don t normally see on the menus of chain pubs  so there was something for everyone  Drinks were quite expensive   I paid nearly   for a pint of cider   but again  this is central London  and there were cheaper options   All in all  definitely worth visiting either for lunch or to unwind at the end of a busy day shopping on Oxford Street  
positive; I have only ever eaten at this hotel so cannot comment on the rooms etc  However the location is wonderful  I always choose this hotel to take my friends as it is my favourite in the Torquay area  In the past I have been stuck as to where I can take my visitors for a bite to eat and a pot of tea etc  not any longer though as I know this eatery is sure to please  The food is tasty and plentiful and the breakfast  sailors  is a treat  The decor is tasteful with comfy chairs  the view is breathtaking  The staff are welcoming and polite and It s my little bit of heaven  
positive; A friend and I had lunch today  They have a special lunch menu which is very reasonably priced and still good quality food   We both had pizza  It was freshly cooked to order and lovely  Too much to eat but they were happy to provide a pizza box to take the rest home  The service was friendly  but not overly so  Will definitely be going back again  
positive; I was browsing trip advisor when I saw reviews for the Pantry and thought it might be quiet nice for breakfast one morning with my boyfriend    We loved the decor and atmosphere of this little place and hadn t expected to find that in Hazlemere   I was impressed that they had a variety of tea and loved the little cast iron tea pots and lovely mismatch teacups    Although I did not mind waiting  the waitress could not answer some of my questions about the menu and had to keep going to ask  She was not new either  as I asked   I was also told they had no asparagus and to pick something else to have with my eggs but then was served asparagus  Our food was luke warm and although we were near the  quot back quot  of the restaurant it got quite cold in there with the door opening    Nonetheless I enjoyed my breakfast  and the produce was good quality   Having a sweet tooth  the selection of freshly baked goods was fantastic   It was quite pricey in my opinion for two breakfasts  tea and two cakes as this was somewhere in the region of   or so which is a bit more than I wish to spend on breaky but once in a while I think would be nice   
positive;Firstly a big thank you to the WAITRESSES who made our visit lovely  Katheryn who was sweeter than our lovely desert  Katy who though seemed a little flustered but was happy to stop and seat us in the waiting area  thank you both for introducing yourselves too  and foor recommend we leave a review  and the girl with the stripy hair you re a credit and made our stay lovely even if the girl with the hair nearly poored a drink on my sister   Whilst the food and the young ladies were lovely I did not appreciate the manager bellowing at his staff just behind us  nor did we appreciate the waiter staring at my neice during the meal   The salmon tikka is to die for  the rice is lovely and soft and though the naan bread was a little overcooked for my liking it was a genorous size   We also likes the little touchs  the Help for Heroes charity pot  the mint chocolates on a pretty paper with our coffee and the lovely decor  However they may want to check their tables as ours was a little wobboly 
positive; We visited after a long day shopping  the service was exceptional and the staff friendly  great price and quality food with plenty of choice 
positive; I chose this restaurant because I knew from past experience that the food is good and plenty of choice  On this occasion my husband and I were taking my elderly parents out for a treat  mum needs a wheelchair and dad is pretty fragile  and also joining my daughter and grand daughter for a special lunchtime together  There are no steps to climb and the toilet facilities are ground floor  It is also light and airy which is quite important for my mum because she has impaired eyesight  There is also roadside parking if the car park nearby is full  This restaurant is on a pedestrianised road so you cannot drive up to the front entrance and we needed it to be a short walk  Tomassi s ticks all the boxes  the staff were a little over stretched  but still managed to serve us within a reasonable time and were courteous and apologetic for any delay  A very pleasant place to be and with such a short walk back to the seafront  Prices are average and the desserts are yummy  
positive;Good traditional British food  The steak with onions and mushrooms was delicious  The starter portions are very generous  I would recommend the meat loaf as a starter  The whisky marmalade bread and butter pudding is recommended  You can have your after dinner coffee in the lounge room by the fire  Advance bookings are a must even when it is off season eg October 
positive; friendly staff  good food well cooked and served  Clean and very convenient to the town  Good value with a good choice 
positive;We ordered a pie and a pizza each  and shared  along with a cider tasting board  The food was amazing  The pizza was delicious  cooked well   with lovely toppings  The pie was also great  served with nice salady bits  yummy potato wedges and delicious chutney  The way the cider tasting board works is fantastic  with the ciders labelled  a range given  and we were asked about our preferences  Unfortunately  the service seemed confused  Everyone we spoke to seemed friendly  but the service wasn t particularly attentive or efficient  and we had to wait a while to get our bill  It left us feeling confused about how it was all supposed to work  and if we had been in a rush it would ve been a bit of a disaster   I would % go back  because the food and drink was fantastic  but I d hope for better luck with the service 
positive; Nice pub and great food   they only take dogs in the bar these days which is a shame as it makes it difficult to get a tbel to eat if you have your hounds in tow  Never the less  great food   the dining area has good atmosphere and the bar is spacious and with a traditionally slate tiled floor  We think it is the best place for a beer in Grasmere  
positive;We went here on a Sunday evening and it is obviously the place to be as it was buzzing and full   It s not Tapas in the Spanish sense but rather a place where you can order lots of small dishes to share which is lovely  The food was nice  not wow  but tasty enough and beautifully presented in little dishes on a cake stand  I really liked that you could eat at any time at the weekends and were not limited to the usual meal times   There are a few tables outside and free parking along the seafront in the winter which is a bonus  Definitely a great place to meet up with friends and relax by the sea 
positive; we had our works night out here the set menu was a varied selection for a reasonable price  service was good but I found the main course salty for my taste   I had the bellied pork   the atmosphere was busy and noisy but as we were on a works night out it suited us If I had gone for a romantic meal for  that night I would have been disappointed not sure if it was only open for Christmas parties  staff were very friendly and accommodating would like to go back sometime soon to try the tagine which I believe is very good 
positive; Don t tend to eat in but regularly buy takeaways from here  food is always prompt  freshly cooked and very tasty  
positive; Every time I visit Cafe du Soleil I am impressed with the food and the service  It is a lovely restaurant with beautiful interior  It is also my son s favourite so good for children too  Their pizzas are great  
positive; The restaurant itself is lovely and fairly reasonable pricing   staff were lovely Only disappointment was the lack of card machine which was a pain but I m sure that s something they will get in future Very nice selection on menu and we would come again 
positive; Nice atmosphere  good service and friendly staff  Pizzas are great  Location is good as there s car park adjoining  
positive; Good service and very helpful clean and value for money good choice on menu  lots of different teas to choose from well worth a visit 
positive; Came here for my husband s bday  We were greeted by a lovely hostess  Really good start :  The waiter was great as well  Shame I can t remember his name  but he did a really great job  Food was really delicious  The only atmosphere is a bit simple    very simple tables  glasses and cutlery  But overall its a great experince  I will defo go back and I will recommend to all my friends  
positive;Our second visit to this fantastic restaurant which my daughter describes as  the shack   The staff are really helpful and friendly and the children s meals have the chips served in little yellow bucket   spade which they get to keep    The food was excellent  They only take cash and you may have to wait for a table but it is well worth the wait    We can t wait to go back 
positive; I thoroughly enjoyed the food at the crown but the drink service left a bit to be desired  however staff explained that the bar was very short staffed and that is the only reason I am not giving  stars 
positive; Lovely pub restaurant with a nice atmosphere  Good outdoor seating area at the back  and a car park   Newspapers provided   Real ale available  and good veggie choices too  Bottles of wine get more expensive as the evening goes on   an incentive to get there early   A nightclub upstairs at weekends for the young at heart  Great  friendly staff   especially Vicky  
positive;Had lunch there with mam and a couple of friends today  Very reasonable and lots of choice  On the seniors menu there are two courses for    or three courses for Food was piping hot and there was plenty of it  Staff very friendly and helpful  Spacious sunny room  Will definitely visit again 
positive;A strange place  tucked away in a side street  the doors were locked when we got there and we struggled to get in  The rooms downstairs had no one in although we could see the chef in the kitchen  Once the door was answered we were shown upstairs to a very pleasant room  From then on  everything was fantastic  The menu was pleasing and the food cooked to perfection  The service was discreet with no hurrying  I really hope that more people discover this unusual little place as they deserve to do well  I d like to go back one day and try the Jazz bar 
positive; We had a lovely meal at Salvo s recently  although   because it was full  a good testament to its popularity we did find it difficult to hear each other speak  but in addition to  quot people noise quot  there was music playing  which added to the problem  That said  the food and wine were excellent   we only managed starters and mains  as far too full for dessert  It is rather pricey  but depends on what you pick  The staff were friendly and helpful and all in all a very pleasant night out  which we hope to repeat in the future  
positive;Bit noisy but good service and good food price and good selection cooked fresh ample parking welcomes children  clean and tidy
positive; We used a Groupon voucher for our meal  so although it was discounted  we had an excellent meal  good   attentive service   had nt realised the pub was there  as tucked away down a lane  Just by the canalside   lovely setting  will return in the summer  Recommend this 
positive; The Red Lion has recently had a change of management  So for those locals who have not tried it for a while give it another chance  Word has got around so you may need to book  The menu changes frequently and seasonal and local produce is used   It provides good value food with a friendly service  The wine selection is good  The food is better and cheaper than many main competitors in the gastro pub market eg The Hare at Langton  LIKED   the food and prices and that it is near me    Don t go if you want to eat outside as there is not much in the way of a garden  
positive; We stayed at a hotel near here whilst on holiday and ate here  nights out of our  night stay  At first glance it looked very swanky  nice dÇ¸cor and outside seating area etc and we thought  quot this is going to be pricey  quot  Once inside we enjoyed a nice  average priced  cocktail at the bar before ordering our meal  The menu had a good choice of steaks along with a few other options but we both opted for steak  The food was good  nice sides of lettuce wedge with choice of dressings and onion loaf which was yummy  we also had a desert each  chocolate brownie and mango mess  both of which were delicious  We got a nice surprise when the bill came as it was only Way cheaper than we had expected given the nice surroundings and good tasty food  We went back on our last night and the food and service were just as good as they had been the first time  Overall would recommend as a very reasonably priced restaurant with good tasty fresh food  good service and lovely surroundings  
positive; Brilliant atmosphere  very good size  love the layout and al fresco feel of the seating  Service was quite good  however  it could have been quicker at times  although it was busy  Food was delicious  came in good time  Drinks were lovely too  Overall had a very nice birthday meal with my family here  
positive; Went to the Bird in Hand for a meal last week  The food was really good  as was the service  Will definitely return again soon  
positive; Received a warm welcome from the locals  Popped in on a couple of occasions whilst holidaying  good beer and the menu looked good  although we didn t get the chance to try it  
positive; Our meal was booked for pm  a party of   The service was reasonable at the restaurant and the food as expect from a chain group  It was very busy as it was a Friday night and the opening night of the Salisbury Festival  The only complaint is that as it is a very old building it is not really suitable for people who have problems walking and we were seated up stairs  
positive;Had a delicious afternoon tea last Saturday whilst visiting Poole with  friends  In fact the apple cake was so good that  of us bought a cake to take home for our families   Unfortunately  once we tried them at home on the Sunday  both apple cakes were mouldy in the centre  We were both very disappointed and out of pocket by a fiver each  The Dorset apple cakes ended up in the bin :  
positive; We went as a party of  on a Thursday night  the staff couldn t do enough for us and the food was excellent  We weren t rushed at all  and the restaurant was busy   Thoroughly enjoyed the night and thanks to the staff for everything they did 
positive; Just enjoyed a delightful meal at Spice  What can I say  Friendly staff who recommended new dishes on the menu  The Food was presented exquisitely   and tasted Devine  The lamb just melted in your mouth  Will definitely be returning and recommending to friends and family  
positive; Took my partner to The Chancel for a birthday meal  Made very welcome on arrival and looked after all night  Great food  excellent wine and lovely atmosphere    Recommend that you should try The Chancel if you get the chance   
positive; We ve just been to Coombe Abbey for the first time  we arrived without a reservation but asked if there was the chance to have afternoon tea  Tea was being served in a large conservatory   every tble seemed to be occupied  We were told that it mght be possible as some pre booked guests had not arrived  minutes after their due arrival time  We were asked to wait in the lounge area for  minutes  The helpful maitre de lady came bak to us within the  minutes   took us to be seated  Our order was taken   our selected pots of tea arrived fairly promptly  Sadly we had finished our generous pots of tea   were considering departing without eating when our selection of sandwiches   cakes arrived  a full  minutes after the pots of tea  As it was my birthday   my husband   I had plenty of time free to sit   chat we didn t make any complaints about the wait  especailly as we hadn t booked in advance  The selection of sandwiches  pastries   the scone each were all very tasty   we ate every last crumb  The portion sizes were just right  we left with our hunger satisfied without feeling full   A couple of points   tablecloths on the tables would be nice  a quicker clearing of tables when guests have departed is needed   several tables around us were left uncleared for  minutes   more  the service should be quicker   the afternoon teas are from a set menu   should be lined up ready to be served on demand  
positive; Good honest food for a family Sunday lunch  Loved the cheesecake  Pleasant welcome  Would visit again  
positive; Great food but the business of the place was a bit off putting  a place for younger people as it is quite noisy and difficult to have a conversation  
positive; We came in here to escape the rain and what a pleasant surprise  We cosied up on the sofa with a newspaper  fresh coffee and a huge slice of apple shortcake with clotted cream which was delicious  You can walk straight out into fields of sheep and onto the coastal path with amazing cliff views    Very much recommended  
positive; Booked a table via email  with speedy response  Bar very busy  recently refurbed  Service was good  meal was very good and very filling  we had chicken and venison  Both wonderful    
positive;Have been twice and had the most amazing food  service may be slightly slow but usually because they re really busy  Also the servers are always lovely
positive;Had a lovely relaxed lunch here with a friend  A very pleasant light and airy dining room and the chairs were especially comfortable  Staff were attentive but not overbearing  The menu choices were just enough   not too much to plough through   and the food was delicious  Will definitely come here again  Thanks 
positive;Visited here with friends and their family whilst on holiday so our table was booked for six adults and one child  It was extremely noisy with loud music and background noise from other diners  so took me some time to adjust to this  However  the menu was varied and had plenty to choose from   probably too much choice  We had drinks and waited quite a while for our order to arrive but were not disappointed when it did  The staff were very helpful and pleasant  The bill was accurate  and well itemised  and the whole meal of good value  Note: the duck fajita looked superb  All in all  a pleasant meal but could the music be turned down please 
positive; Was taken out to Gorka Square  and really looking forwards to it as I had heard great things from friends and family  Really enjoyed the meal: was a little like having a curry in Bradford  with the complimentary poppadoms and chutney etc  The wine was enjoyable and service interesting  We didn t have a problem getting service  but with as many staff on I am surprised that they weren t keeping a more even eye over the tables  I guess they give special attention to their regulars  which should probably be commended  Thoroughly enjoyed the evening and it felt quite special dining at Gorka Square  Very likely to revisit  probably as a treat or special occasion  
positive;Visited twice whilst we were in Padstow  The price was good for Padstow  Large portions and the food is to a good standard  The service was efficient and friendly  I would recommend the sea food platter  This is a gem and is a great place to take in the views of the harbor 
positive; My boyfriend and I ate lunch at the pump house while visiting the Albert Dock    It s centrally located and aesthetically pleasing from the outside  Inside the pub is well decorated and the staff are lovely    We ate and had a drink each  good food as far as pub grub goes  I had the fish and chips which came with your choice of mushy or garden peas and tartare sauce  Fish was fresh and beautifully cooked  My boyfriend has scampi and chips which looked a little less appetising but tasted ok    Both the real Ales and wines were good  Variety of choices and well priced    Nice pub to pop into whilst visiting the dock  
positive; Lovely food  from a good menu  not too much choice   served by friendly and attentive staff   The pub has really benefitted from it s recent refurbishment   very stylish  We visited on a Monday lunchtime   and it was comfortably and re assuringly busy  
positive; As a fan of tapas we booked for a Saturday night  Used to eating late in Spanish restaurants  we were surprised when at   they had to check if the kitchen was open for desserts  Overall the service was adequate with young staff  They needed someone more experienced to manage front of house    But the food was good  a reasonable if limited wine list and good selection of dishes  Will attend again  and have used their sister tapas in North Laines  
positive;The menu has a great choice  I have visited numerous times and my favourite is bangers and mash   It has a lovely relaxed pub vibe  however the service could be improved more efficient 
positive;I took my family out for a treat to Buzz s a few weeks ago and I have to say I was very impressed by the staff and decor  We were very looked after and my  yr old son was treated like a prince  Our food order was taken quickly and our waitress helped us choose the right smoothie for me as I was spoilt for choice  Our for arrived in good time and my husband gave it the  quot Oh wow quot  award  I ordered a hot dog and it arrived warm  the waitress apologised and asked if I wanted a new one made or this one heated  she was very attentive and friendly throughout the whole experience  I will be returning to Buzz s for the next family treat 
positive; I liked this restaurant we were rather impressed with the dÇ¸cor and it was nice and cool and comfortable  The staff were helpful however we did have to wait a while before they took our order  They also did not have the wine I ordered and expected me to choose another straight away   Husband had a great pizza and I had a seafood spaghetti dish which hit the spot followed by bread and butter pudding which was lush    
positive;Nice interior  prompt service  nice food  though the Chimichanga was a bit greasy   but as a party of   all of the other food was excellent  though portions were a bit large for us  We ll be back 
positive; We were visiting with friends and they suggested we tried Bettys  The queue was so long we looked for an alternative and landed in Weeton s  So glad we did  Busy again but quickly seated by charming staff  Try the hot chocolate with a chocolate stick  its the real chocolate overload but so good on a very chilly day  Gorgeous bakewell slice to round it off  Glorious    
positive;Lovely meal here  One of the best vegetarian dishes I have ever had    Need to book as very busy but well worth a visit 
positive; Very tasty food with a decent menu range especially for veggie options  Although it was understandably a busy day  we arrived just before pm and only waited a couple of minutes for a table  The staff were all very helpful  pleasant and cheerful  Quick  efficient service all round  We all enjoyed our menu choices  particularly the desserts   :   Free glass of wine for the mums was a nice treat which rounded off a fantastic day with the family  We will return I m sure  They also do a takeaway service  
positive; Had a really nice evening here  as soon as i walked in the door i was acknowledged and greeted by a member of staff  Bar Staff had smiles were friendly and well presented  i was a lone dinner and felt welcomed and at ease  I ordered a steak which was cooked as i had asked  Up selling and Quality checks were completed with style and elegance  Customer service was excellent    Is there room for improvement  yes why not try some more home baking instead of the alternative  probably would be cheaper and you d be on to a winner for sure  
positive;The sandwiches were good but were not outstanding  However  when I mentioned to the waitress that I would have liked an egg mayonnaise sandwich she was only too happy to provide a never ending supply    The scones  on the other hand  were fantastic  I ve actually never tasted anything so delicious  The tea was also incredibly good with a wide variety to choose from 
positive;A welcoming wheelchair friendly environment serving excellent food and helpful staff  An centrally located pub that has lots of space both inside and out  with an extensive menu to suit all the family  Generous portions at a price that suits most pockets  Despite being a Sunday when places like this get busy  we were not rushed and felt comfortable to sit and relax and enjoy our time together  Lovely staff 
positive; Wonderful location to enjoy a superb freshly cooked breakfast  When the weather is good  the views over the countryside are the perfect backdrop whilst enjoying a hearty plate of food  The food is of excellent quality  making it our favourite place to spend a Sunday morning  
positive; Loved this bar the theme and entertainment looks great  Unfortunately was fully booked whilst we was there so pre book before attending and hoping to get in on the night for the dinner show  We ate our breakfasts here on both mornings of our stay  The food tasted great but service was a little slow   The coffees were luke warm when arriving at the table as they were left on the side a while after being made  When ordering our breakfasts a couple of people asked to remove a couple of items and replaced with something else  For example no black pudding  mushrooms or tomatoes and only got one slice of bacon in exchange    whilst paying full price  I ordered poached eggs on toast and was charged for eggs Benedict after they forgot about my drink and food  I would of just assumed a discounted price would of been the right think to do if I was serving a customer who had to wait for their drink and food whilst everyone else was tucking in   Other than that is was great and it was a shame we missed teh show :   
positive; Five of us dined on a Sunday late lunch  early dinner  for my sons birthday  Two of us had the Sunday lunch which we can highly recommend  we have had this before and the beef is so tender and tasty  One diner had the fillet steak which was beautifully tender  the two other diners had the monkfish  This too was delicate and tasty  We all had dessert  either ice cream or ice cream sundae which finished the meal off nicely  All in all a very filling meal   howeverit it is quite expensive meal but you get quality food so it is certainly worth paying for  Ther service was attentive  although a little slow but the restaurant was busy so you would expect this  Better than being rushed Worth a visit  we will certainly be returning  
positive; Since the pub was taken over a year ago by the current Thai owners the place finally has some life in it  The car park is often full and the benches outside are great in the warm weather  I have both eaten in and used the take away and have always been impressed  Very friendly staff and very tasty authentic Thai food  
positive;I liked the food  however the employees looked abit glum  their service would be a lot more welcoming if they at least smiled to help build a customer relationship  I also thing that you should t have to pay an extra p for ketchup and mayonnaise 
positive; new year treat for hubby and I  Very attentive and friendly customer service  Tasty Welsh beer Not too long wait for starters Calamari Best we ve had in long time  and chilli beef quesidallas Mains were burgers good quality everything well cooked and good portion  WILL definitely return and recommend highly to all  
positive; Situated next to the premier inn by the side of the canal  Lots of tables  and heaters  if you want to sit outside  Plenty choice on the menu  Have visited this pub lots of times and have yet to have a bad meal  The lunch time menu available until pm is certaintly worth a look   courses for a set price is very good value  Ideal if you have children who dont want a kids menu  as i have  The garlic flatbread is also a favourite with my grandaughter  
positive; Having walked up and down Camden High Street many a time I have to admit that The Blues Kitchen had never really screamed out to me  however  after a friend recommended it  I thought it was worth trying out   Our server was attentive from the minute we were seated  he knew the menu inside out and suggested we try the Crocodile Special as our starter  For me it was a little too smokey but my guest thought it was brill  For our mains we shared the Jambalaya and Famous Chilli between us and we were practically fighting each other for the last mouthfuls of each   Usually the whole live music restaurant thing annoys me but there was live music playing throughout our meal and we could still chat between ourselves  I will absolutely be recommending The Blues Kitchen next time someone asks where s good to go and I will definitely be forcing my boyfriend to spot me some Famous Blues Kitchen Chilli this weekend  
positive; Advisable to book the restaurant  Good meal  and experience  We went back the next evening    Looks it would be nice to stay too  Good location 
positive; We found this on Tripadvisor and were really pleased with this recommendation for lunch  Great location on a hot day with a pretty garden in a shaded area  Ideal after a morning of sight seeing and in a good central location for continuing your visit to Oxford  Food was healthy looking  tasty  with a good choice of options and plenty of fresh bread  The relaxed atmosphere and comfortable tables made this a good value lunch in an interesting building  Staff were polite and the queue moved quickly so service was efficient  Would definitely recommend this lunch spot and would be delighted to visit again  
positive; Great food and service in a small friendly restaurant  Would definitely recommend  Was very busy so would suggest you book if possible  
positive; Food was lovely  service let things down rare lamb when ordered for well done and no food was hot when it arrived  We were a later table but feel things should still be good  and then to top off our lunch a photo shoot through our lunch was quite frankly totally unnecessary as they close for the evening on Wednesdays for dinner    The meal was however great and we will return to give them a second go at getting it right  
positive;We came here as a group to celebrate a friend s birthday and I didn t know what to expect as I had never been before  The parking was a bit of an issue and I had to park further away but this is understandable as it is on a main road  It is a small two storey restaurant but they managed to fit us in comfortably  The food was delicious and quick to arrive at the table  When we got the bill at the end we were pleasantly surprised and although this is unusual to say I would have happily paid more for it  I will definitely be going back soon 
positive;beautiful food  family friendly restaurant  simple in decor  style and service  every morsel was fantastic  This is not like an ordinary curry at all  best food for miles around 
positive; Went to the Royal Oak for lunch with a friend  The staff were very friendly and helpful giving us the variety of menu s that they had on offer and answering any questions we had  They have a fantastic lunch menu for amazing prices  The food itself is delicious and far beyond what you would expect for a pub  I would highly recommend the beef burger with hand cut chips  The Royal Oak has a great atmosphere  very friendly and relaxed making it a great place to go with friends  family and work colleagues  I shall definitely be returning  
positive; Visited on a Saturday evening  very busy place   but no wonder as the staff and food are great  Did not have a table free when we arrived but were given a menu and told we would not have to wait too long  Believe me it was worth the wait  I have never seen such varieties of burgers  The food was lovely and the service from the staff good  The staff obviously love it there as they were moving to the music when serving food and waiting for orders  it is not often you see staff enjoying themselves when they could be out themselves on a Saturday night  well worth a visit  but a bit of advice  don t eat from lunchtime if you want to finish your meal  Wish there was a Pit nearer to home  
positive; Not sure why the hotel reviews come under the tearoom  which we didn t use  Stayed in room  which is a lovely large room overlooking the square  great for sitting in window seat watching world go by  so word of warning  not the quietest room if you sleep with the window open  Shower leaked water and due to age of building shower head very low  even my husband at  m didn t fit under shower head  Food was fabulous  great staff and comfortable atmosphere  can understand why a lot of other guests were repeat visitors  Sour note  bedroom UHT milk was past its sell by date  not nice   Told reception  so more out of date milk was put into our room the  next day  not impressive for such an expensive place to stay  
positive;We stayed at The old bridge Hotel last Sunday and Monday which is perfectly placed for visiting last of the summer wine attractions and beautiful walks  We were in room  which is on the front of the hotel with its own balcony  the room was super clean and the bed very comfortable  The food is good with large portions at reasonable prices  breakfasts which were included in the price of our bookings were very good  the staff were all very friendly  As stated in previous comments the bedroom got really hot even though the heating was not on  we had to sleep with the balcony door open all night  Maybe because we were on the floor above restaurant  If we were to go to holmfirth again we would definately stay again and would highly recommend 
positive; Refreshingly lovely meal out with charming service from the talented young singers and their music student accompanist  Despite our visit being a discount  quot special offer quot  it was still expensive   but well worth it  All the other diners looked equally happy and enthralled  
positive; ate here last minute last Sunday evening at pm polite attentive waitress and good food fairly quick arriving    bill for  with  courses 
positive; Went with a couple of friends on a deal with wine included  Food was good  Have the laksa it s inspirational  
positive; I visited the Old Stock Joint with some friends for post work drinks on a Friday  Nice busy atmosphere but fairly quick bar service  We ended up staying for dinner   a great pie  pork and cider  with a huge pile of mash and green veg  Simple food done well  
positive;If you re out shopping and fancy something a bit different to a pub lunch  Food is perfect  Great venue  lovely and airy  lots of space and good seats all round  worth a visit
positive; The staff are all very warm and welcoming The food is improved since our last trip  still quite basic but very good value for money  Leanne one of the managers was always very friendly and helpful as were all the staff 
positive; I went for lunch with relatives  I found the food very good and good value  The service was a little bit slow and the room was a little bit noisy  so it was sometimes difficult to hear the person opposite talking  but overall it was good and I plan to definitely come back when my parents come over  
positive; We booked this restaurant as a recommend via various taxi drivers in York  Our welcome was anything but pleasant we felt extremely uncomfortable when we entered the restaurant  The waitress was informative ans extremely helpful  The food was good but they do need to work on your initial welcome  
positive;Piccolino s has been completely refurbished to include a roof top terrace which has an electronic roof for all season s dining  The refurbished restaurant is to an extremely high standard and will not disappoint   The restaurant focusses on excellent customer service which is refreshing  These people really do care   The menu provides a great selection of Italian dishes from fish  meat and pasta  In my opinion the level is higher end Italian food  The pasta is particularly good  I would have given this restaurant an overall rating of   however  my only disappointment was that we ordered half a dozen oysters each  whilst my husbands oysters were full and juicy I had two shells that were virtually empty  This was quickly rectified  however  this is a special dish which is expensive and would have expected this to be right first time   The restaurant has a lovely buzz  not too loud that you can t hear  and I would recommend it as a smart casual restaurant to be totally enjoyed 
positive; We went on a Monday after pm  All food had % off  We would definitely go there again on a Monday  
positive;Been here for afternoon tea  very reasonable prices  Happy to provide more sandwiches at no extra cost  Also have good cocktails in the evening although these are fairly expensive 
positive; We had come in the evening before for some baklava to soothe our nerves after a terrible meal at another restaurant  Bog standard though the baklava was it was  we noticed the open charcoal grill and vowed to return for some fresh food after the awful reheated chicken experience of that day   We did  for lunch on a Saturday afternoon  We ordered falafal  and chicken and lamb kebabs  The service  while very friendly  was a little slow  the waitress struggled to get our orders due to work men obstructing her way  but everything came within a reasonable time  There were drilling and works happening out back  which were inappropriate and loud  though thankfully  brief  While our waitress didn t come and apologise for it of her own volition  she was sweet in her assurances that it would soon be over  when we asked  Based on the bad reviews on this website  I assume they are in the midst of a refit  the toilet cistern even h 
positive; Excellent value for money and very friendly and helpful staff   Great atmosphere too   The Carvery is amazing   
positive; Fresh food cooked to order  fantastic value  Great service been several times and also gone for the takeaway option    Love it   
positive; I booked a table through lastminute for the meal deal which also included theatre tickets  We were in a rush and the staff went above and beyond so we could be in time for the start of the production  The calamari as a starter is definitely a must and my friend for the USA said that she had never tasted lovelier chicken wings then the ones she had as a starter  Our main was define and the cocktails absolutely first class    Well done Ruby Blue I will definitely be back  
positive; Had a lovely meal here  All the food was very tasty and fresh with a large menu to suit fussy customers  Will definitely be returning  
positive; This restaurant is an absolute treat  I ve been many times now and never been disappointed    Service is excellent  Real attention to detail that you don t see so much any more  Unfolding napkins  topping up water  ensuring proper cutlery is available  It sounds simple but it s the little things that make an experience special    Food is absolutely delicious  I have never had a bad meal here    I just love it  The lighting  The ambiance  The staff  The food  The location  Yes  it s expensive  but you get what you pay for    
positive; Visited Big Easy for the first time a couple of weeks ago having heard all good things from colleagues    And I wasn t disappointed  We had the lobster and steak deal  great value for money and our server was very friendly and attentive  Will be returning tonight to test out the BBQ food   
positive; food is always good and very quick delivery  if there is anything that you would like that is quot nt on the menu just ask and they will do it for you  
positive; nice meal  Didnt like being on a table by the open door which overlooked the gents toilets  Unfortunately there was a wedding reception and the bar had run out of champagne  
positive; My family and I visited the Ocean Inn for lunch at the weekend and what a surprise  From the outside  this pub looks tired and dated and to be honest  the inside could do with some TLC too but the food and service great    I m always sceptical about eating fish and chips in a venue that isn t a fish and chip shop but after having read some other reviews on the Ocean Inn  we decided to go for it and order them anyway  It was a great decision  We had cod and chips and I have to say  it was delicious and just as good as a fish and chip shop    Service was quick and very friendly too    Don t be put off by the exterior or interior of this pub  The food  cod and chips and ploughmans  is great and well priced too  
positive; Not a fan of  chain  dining when visiting London but on a friend s recommendation we booked a table for an early evening meal  Lovely setting next to the river and staff very attentive  Steak and frites  fish goujons and fish cakes were very tasty and reasonably price  given the location  Great as a safe bet when in the area  
positive;We eat at this popular cafe probably once a week or so and have always been happy with the food and service  The quantities are good and my particular favourite is the liver and bacon  The staff are pleasant and helpful  Great value for money too 
positive; Visited Thai Balcony a week ago with my boyfriend  We were amazed by the prawn soup we had for starter  totally recommend it  We then had roasted duck and spicy chicken for main served with rice  Satisfying quantity of food  The Thai beer that we have tried was really tasty and refreshing as well  The atmosphere was beautiful with designs which make you feel you are in Asia  
positive; It was standard pub grub  served by friendly folk  Can t complain and can recommend to others who are after the same  decent portions served by genuinely tidy people  
positive; My partner   I have regularly used this restaurant for the past  years even though it is  miles from where we live  The food is always very good   the portions are also very good value for money  One member of staff  Nick has become more like a friend he is a lovely man   always goes out of his way to make us feel special    We went there last night   were presented with a  new  menu   were more than shocked to see that probably % of the starters had gone from under   each to    per starter  The mains had also gone up but nowhere near the percentage of the starters We understand that sometimes there needs to be price increases but were absolutely shocked at the amount of the increase   We would normally pay about  for our meal   drinks but last night our bill was  Unfortunately this has now made us rethink going there as although it is one of the best Chinese restaurants we have used it certainly made us feel like we had been cheated :  
positive; Excellent fast service  i went to wrapchic the staff there were very friendly  i ordered the Burrito which was recommended by one of the staff  And i have to say it is by far the BEST burrito i have had  It is not expensive to eat here and this might partly explain why it is so popular  Nice clean environment  friendly staff  quick service i will definitely recommend wrapchic and will definably be going again 
positive; The burgers here are always so tasty and I love how they re custom made to order  it really does add a personal touch  And don t get me started on the fries  You get SO MANY and they re delicious  So tasty and unffff  I could scoff them all day   The one downfall however is the price  and it s not that I think this restaurant is expensive because I actually don t  it s more the inconsistency that bothers me: the Five Guys restaurants in not just the US but also in London are relatively cheaper than the one here in Nottingham and that to me is an issue  albeit a minor one but still an issue none the less   I really wouldn t let the price difference put you off though  I haven t  
positive; We went to this restaurant to have the fish and chips  although it is also a grill and serves Turkish food  The fish and chips were lovely  Really fresh and both the fish and the chips was very good  We looked around us at the other diners and noticed they were mostly eating the Turkish food and the meals also looked very good with plenty on the plates  We will definitely go back and next time try the grill  Only gave a four and not a five as the menu I was given was very greasy and dirty  which was a shame as it meant the first impression was not good  My husbands menu was also a bit grubby  
positive; Been here before  years ago  so was looking forward to going again   I firstly Googled this place  Opening hours from pm on a Saturday it said    As I was out early  we wanted to eat early  I used their online booking system  but it would only reserve from   so I filled it in and asked for the time to be altered to pm and for a table upstairs    Didn t hear anything for days so forwarded the booking to their email address  Still heard nothing for days  In the end I rang and booked it    When we got there  the restaurant didn t open till pm  Then all they had was a booking for me at   and tried to seat us downstairs  Got it swiftly changed and headed upstairs   We were the first people up there and so chose a window seat by a blasting radiator  Lovely    We ordered the prosecco  which was lovely  though we were a bit miffed it was poured into our wine glasses and not flutes    They served my spicy soup without mushrooms for me    My friend adored her chicken satay starter  which arrived covered in peanut sauce  rather than the sauce being separate   Didn t bother her    I ordered a Thai Red Curry with chicken  It was delicious but could ve had just a little more of a kick to it for my taste   My friend ordered a yellow chicken curry and couldn t fault it   Boiled rice for me  egg fried rice for my friend and no complaint about either    Service was unhurried and friendly and upstairs was filling up nicely by the time we left  
positive; Reasonablly priced food for an average sit down meal  My boyfriend and I like it as we come and go as we please  get salad bar and decent food for not top dollar  Some would say the food quality is not great here  its not amazing but it is not awful  Always had good service and hot yummy food so have never complained  Always tables available and big open restaurant  Surprised they only had one toilet per gender  Still yet to try the carvery  
positive; Nice place for lunch although it does get very busy  However the service is fantastic  so the waiting line does move pretty quickly   lots of healthy eating option   all coupled with a great fashion environment   store downstairs    
positive; I had a very nice dinner with friends at Papagee last Saturday   We had a variety of different starters to share and  as main course  a pizza  The food was delicious  all ingredients are from Italy  and they all taste very good  The Pizza is great  very tasty   One last word about Gaetano  Papagee   that is a great host  very friendly  We ll go back for sure  
positive; Tried this on the off chance after trying to get into the Cornish Arms and giving up at the sight of the very long queue for tables  We were able to get a table without a reservation  Monday of half term week  and were made very welcome  Food was delicious  good prices   very friendly service  Would definitely recommend  
positive; I ve looked in here before and wasn t impressed  but friends decided we were eating here  so that was it  The menu was amazing  quite a few different dishes and the salads were well presented  I had a hot baguette  my husband had a pancake with smoked salmon prawns and cream  the food was served quickly and the drinks were hot  the place is clean and tidy  the staff were friendly and approachable  For a small place to have a supply of soya milk was also impressive  
positive; Avoid busy times   Sunday when can t book now a no no for us  Shame as the food s great and staff very helpful 
positive; We were in the area visiting my in laws who have recently moved to Chilcompton and with it being my birthday the previous day  they suggested we went to The Somerset Wagon for a meal  The food was very good and we all enjoyed it very much  The pub was very busy but the waiting staff coped very well and I would thoroughly recommend going here but be sure to book a table  We all had  courses and it worked out about   a head without drinks  
positive;stayed here for a night on business  The food was excellent and staff and locals very friendly  Room was very nice and the bed was so comfy   it is fantastic value for money  The full English breakfast was stunning and the staff in the morning couldn t do enough to help you  I will definitely be going back
positive; Really lovely tea shop  Fab cakes and v generous portions  Real tea with dainty little strainers   the kids loved it  A gem in a lovely village town 
positive; Food was lovely but only problem was the place was freezing Evan a few other customers was saying the same thing 
positive; We went to Cobham three weeks ago to spend a day visiting our friends  At mid afternoon we checked tripadvisor reviews looking for a good restaurant nearby  Finally  we make our way to Woodlands Park Hotel and its restaurant Oak Room  Dinner was wonderful  candle lights and music amazing and quite good quality meal  Waiters and the staff very professional and kind  And happy to meet a fellow spaniard  Antonio  who advised us a fine wine  Both couples had a lovely evening  We shall come back  
positive;My partner and I visited The Crown on a recommendation of the owners of the B B we were staying in last week  We went with some trepidation as we had seen some mixed reviews  but we were very pleasantly surprised  A beautiful pub in an idyllic setting  a great welcome  and the best steak I have ever eaten    Well worth checking The Crown out :  
positive; We stopped here to look around the lovely garden centre and decided on closer inspection to enjoy lunch in the cafe here  Coffee was lovely and food was tasty and good value for money  Beautiful views  
positive; We enjoyed coffee here   no food  but it had lovely views of the bay from the window and was very comfortable   food look good and varied  
positive; Very good food and atmosphere   expect modern British classics  The service is very attentive  Not cheap but worth the bill  
positive;Visited here as a last minute decision on a Sunday lunchtime  The food was great  we had the meat charcuterie platter and various pizzas which tasted authentic and fresh    Service was friendly but a little slow  and the music was louder than we liked  but would visit again for the food 
positive;Nice Lounge  friendly  polite staff and food of good standard and didn t wait too long considering it was busy   teamtime on a friday noght  
positive; Meal for   the staff were really helpful and great service  Food was good  Lovely clean restaurant  
positive;We treated our daughter to an end of half term meal out and decided to stay local  Easy booking via email and confirmation received quickly  Menu is a little restricted but all three found something to appeal straight away  Starters were served within ten minutes and main courses followed promptly  The thing that stood out for me was that the food was hot  Too many places serve food Wark and I like my dinner hot  Great activity sheet for our daughter which kept her enterrained and the happiest lady working there that I ve seen in a while   Maybe menu could do with expanding a little bit definitely worth a visit 
positive; cant find the spinningfields one on here but highly reommend there  tucked away but worth the find  me and my husband always go there  quite nice for couples and the staff and food are really great  
positive; The staff were friendly and quick to get us seated and served  The food was delicious  especially the pinot mushrooms starter   we indulged after the meal with a chocolate martini as suggested by our waitress instead of a dessert  really glad we did as it finished our meal off perfectly  overall the staff were quick to make sure we had everything we needed and we really enjoyed the food and general atmosphere of the crown  will certainly be returning  
positive; Went here with my mom and friends for a lunch on Saturday  No problems getting a table and we hadn t booked  Food was delicious and reasonably priced  good size portions  Cooked to order  Would recommend for a nice meal out at a very reasonable price in a pleasant setting 
positive; This pub was amazing  We stopped here for lunch after a long drive and had possibly the best ham egg and chips  We came back again during the week for a few drinks and stayed right till close   The best part about this pub was the staff  as we were the last people in the bar and had a long walk back to our hotel the bar tender kindly gave us a lift back  We didn t catch his name but what a hero  
positive;I was a bit taken aback by the review of this restaurant by my friend Silvermac below  same party as  March   whilst I love her dearly  I must disagree on several points  Firstly  the food was actually quite good  My Calamari  which I had as a starter and she didn t  was very nice  the lasagne was admittedly slightly bland  but the Panacotta was also good  I think the service was a bit unfriendly and chaotic  clearly looks like there might be some  issues  there  but the food is tons better than any other so called Italian restaurant in Hertford including Pizza Express and Ask  the latter is particularly awful  worst pasta of my life   I have asked a couple of others in the party and they also enjoyed their food  but my friend complaining below ordered steak which might not be the best choice in an Italian Restaurant in any case  I personally enjoyed the food and liked the ambience inside   reminded me of the restaurants in Stoke Newington  instead of the bland corporate shiny suburban nothingness of chain restaurants  of which there are so so many in Hertford   I would say that Ilvino did not perhaps live up to some of the more glowing reviews on this website  but it s much better than a lot of the restaurants in Hertford and certainly isn t  Vile  or  awful    PS re the tables  it is made perfectly clear when you book on a Friday or Saturday night that you MUST vacate your table by a certain time  as there are two sittings  so if there was a problem with our table not being ready that would have been because someone was outstaying their welcome  
positive; Lovely place  Great atmosphere  great cocktails and amazing dessert  Vegetarian options could be revised a little as they aren t very exciting on the normal menu  But over all quite good  
positive; Visited for the first time tonight for dinner  three of us opted for fish and the other chicken nuggets  Service was quick and very friendly which was great  I do like it when they service food in a box as it seems to be less greasy once you get it home  Overall really enjoyed the food  the portion of chips was smaller than I would have thought however still very tasty  Would recommend a try and will be visiting again  
positive; Went in for breakfast and so no queues or waiting  Had scrambled egg and toast followed by coffee and cake  Yummy  Nice girl served us and although the tables are a little close together enjoyed every mouthful  
positive;Unlike the usual buffet style  quot eat as much as you like quot  menu to be found in some Chinese restaurants  this restaurant brings you your choices freshly cooked as if you were choosing off the main menu  I was in a party of  women and we chose a mix of  starters to share and  mains plus rice and noodles again to share  We finished with individual deserts  The food was delicious and for us the quantities were just right  The staff are happy to bring extra dishes on request but it is stipulated on the menu that you don t order more than you can manage  We went on a Tuesday evening and it was quiet so we could hear each other which was what we wanted 
positive;Great tea shop  real bone china cups  homemade cakes to die for and good value for money  Wonderful location at the end of the Manifold Valley  Ideal quiet spot to bring children with bikes or enjoy a walk along the trail 
positive; Lovely location  friendly welcome  Food did go downhill but it has now improved  they love dogs and I love the relaxed feel of this pub 
positive; Even though the Giggling Squid has been open for a while my husband and I had never been there till  weeks ago and then we liked it so much that we went there the Saturday before the last and again yesterday  Feb st both times for lunch    the first time  Jan th  my husband ordered ONE BIG DISH with rice  which was the prawn red curry  excellent choice for   pounds  and I had a bento that included a type of lamb stew with carrots and potatoes  duck spring rolls and sesame toast for   pounds the variety was good but the start of the show was the BIG DISH of prawn red curry    that was really value for Money because the portion is bigger and very filling    well  yesterday we went back and my husband wanted a d vu from last Saturday and I ventured into the unknown with the Thai beef salad   omG    the beef melted in my mouth   simply delicious    
positive;Croma is a growing chain of Italian restaurants  the original being in Manchester  They know what they do and do it well  pizza and pasta being the mainstays  Pizza was great  crispy bases with good ingredients and innovative combinations  Service was fast and friendly  Kid friendly too  It s like Pizza Express used to be before it became massive and corporately anonymous 
positive; Didn t realise from the front that this places goes right back and opens into a great bar area where they have live music  which wasn t on as it was January and a quieter month  so I will go back again  The cocktails were a bit different from the norm and the food was very good  the veggie option that evening was courgetti spaghetti  which I didn t think sounded too interesting but it was really tasty in a gorgous tomato sauce  will also check it out for weekend drinks  a classy place  
positive; no always the fastest delivery  but if your collecting then it is a very speed service with wonderful food evereytime 
positive; We went to Hayling Island for the day and wanted to finish on a good note  Unfortunately the Olive Leaf restaurant was full so we took a gamble on trying the Piranha restaurant and we don t regret it at all  The service was really good and the the food delicious  We did not feel unwelcome with two young children  m and y  and were really well cared for  Being French we find it sometimes difficult to get good food in english restaurant but not this time  The restaurant part was full so we had to eat in the bar part but we could order the same food  The only drawback was to be really close to the bar and it being a bit noisy but we that way we would not have felt bad if the kids had started complaining   A really enjoyable experience  
positive; Friendly welcoming staff  Excellent authentic Italian food  Great specials board  Family friendly Sunday evening experience  House red a good choice to compliment the delicious pasta of the day     
positive; Usually the food is good  but unless you book  there is often a long wait for tables  Unfortunately you can t book online for the same evening  
positive; Very friendly   also very dog friendly too  Lovely food  I really enjoyed my veggie Sunday lunch  Helpful  smiley staff  Would definitely recommend  
positive; Had a nice meal here on a very cold March evening  They have delicious pizza baked in a wood fired oven  I had a yummy sea food pasta and a salad  I wasn t wild about the cannolo dessert  a bit soggy and tasteless  But everything else was nice  The atmosphere is cozy and the prices are very reasonable  Its fun to eat at an Italian which is not a chain  
positive; The food was delicious and the staff very friendly  I recommend the pan seared scallops with chorizo  
positive; A pleasant room to sit in with space and lots of tables  The menu offers a very good range of meals:starters mains and puddings  Also  lighter snacks if preferred  The staff were friendly and helpful  
positive; We are house hunting in the area and asked for a recommendation  as we had two viewings lined up  My husband had broccoli and Stilton soup  followed by roast belly pork and seasonal vegetables  I chose wood pigeon as my starter and followed it with a rainbow trout fillet accompanied by beautiful roasted vegetables  washed down with a fantastic house Sauvignon Blanc  We would have stayed to sample dessert  if we d had room  which is questionable   had it not been for our appointments   The food was absolutely delicious  beautifully presented  English haute cuisine at its best  We will be back  With our friends and family  to boot  should we be fortunate enough to find our dream home in the vicinity  
positive; This is a quirky pub  very popular with young and old  the menu is very good and different and the bar is well stocked especially with different Gins  We ate there twice and the Manager and staff were very friendly and helpful  There is plenty of room and food is served all day  which we appreciated being able to eat early  
positive; We have been to this restaurant many times and have been disappointed  The food is wonderful  The staff are very welcoming and friendly  We shall be visiting many more times in the future  
positive; We had been put off this pub as a sailor I used to be able to go in here in a wetsuit  Now you cannot  even in a set part of the bar for example  I think this is a great shame as the outside bar used to be great as well and was not a problem if the floor got a little wet and muddy   Anyway    we had a lovely smart dinner and we loved the view  quality and choice of food and good service   Can take a little while to get served at the bar but table service fine   Cost is reasonable for style of food   would definitely go there again  
positive; Visited the shopping area often and always wanted to eat here  Lovely welcoming and professional staff  early evening we hadn t booked but fitted us in with a one hour slot so we took coffee on the sofas  The city skyline is great  BUT why Oh why do you need such LOUD BANGING music by no particular artist being played by a DJ with laptop and control box  It adds nothing to the evening   if your with friends your not interested and if your a couple it does not add to the romance  Its too load when you and the waiter can not hear each other  Your not alone in this the OBLISK at the Shard is the same  When will management realise if the restaurant has great food and staff and the setting is so wonderful you need nothing more to make the atmosphere complete  
positive; A bit pricey for the quality of food  but the location  atmosphere  and team are great  Enjoyable Saturday evening here with my partner  
positive; A good place to have a simple meal before attending the performance at the Birmingham Symphony Hall  The place is clean and the service is quick  The staff team is attentive to the needs of the customers    The meals are freshly prepared and also reasonably priced  
positive; Last night was my third visit to Longhorn and I am yet to be disappointed  The service is polite and friendly  cocktails amazing and food delicious  As it is a new restaurant  my friends and I all chose different items from the menu to sample and enjoyed them all  I would massively recommend the Beef Ribs  good portion size and cooked to perfection  and the burger my friend had was delicious  A great selection of side dishes and desserts  the mac and cheese in particular was divine  All in all  a fantastic meal in a great atmosphere   a great addition to the high street  
positive; Came here for a late lunch with friends   staff were great about my wanting to change part of my meal  swapping chips for a jacket  veggies for a salad   and they got it spot on  thank you  Ordering at the bar was a little chaotic   several queues for food and people coming to the bar and getting served immediately though  
positive;This is my favorite Chinese takeaway I ve found in the area  The portion sizes are great  the hot and sour soup is delicious  and the crispy beef is really tasty  though not terribly filling as an entrÇ¸e   It s always been fairly quick to pick up  but I don t know about their delivery times 
positive; Having tried lot of types of Asian food in the past think this is one of real seals  Great food and service   Definitely recommended   
positive; I visited last Saturday night with my husband and daughter  who is normally picky about her food and we got a very pleasant surprise  The food was all locally sourced and was cooked imaginatively  my daughter choosing sausage said it was the best she had ever tasted  The Refreshment Room is based in an old pub which had been popular when the ferry had been running but had fallen into disrepair  It has now been taken over by the same management who owned the Villa Jazz restaurant in Oxton and they have managed to keep their old staff including chefs  A first glance the pub looks slightly run down but in actual fact it has been sympathetically restored in order to keep the atmosphere of the old pub rather than a smart Cheshire type restaurant that has lost all its character  It is still possible to go in just for a drink or even a game of pool   At lunchtime they serve light meals including low price meals for pensioners but on Saturday night there is a fixed price bistro type meal with the accompaniment of live music  We will certainly be going back there  
positive; This an oasis in the shadow of The City   the garden in the summer and snug fire in the winter  The coffee is good  just tell the staff how you like your coffee  and it happens  and the red wine and cheeky cocktails are good if you re indulging  And not expensive by normal cocktail prices  Tasty range of food   wraps  pastas  salads  breakfast dishes  specials etc  Cooked freshly too  no frozen bought in stuff as far as I know  Kids meals  Best of all  the genuine welcome  Looking at some of the other comments here  maybe it doesn t always show when they are very busy  but most of the time customers are greeted as friends  And if you re passionate about supporting independent outlets  this is a genuine family business and the owner is around most days  
positive; Pretty new to Indian cuisine but  I loved this place  We ordered korma and rogan josh  they were both excellent  the texture and taste was different from anything I have had before and you could taste the quality of the ingredients The ice cream dessert was very nice too  Really enjoyed it and hope to visit again on a Sunday to sample the buffet  
positive; Went for an early roast lunch  Fab cheese soufflÇ¸ followed by carvery  More expensive than some but worth it and the service was great  Will come again  
positive; The menu had plenty of choice  the food was hot and we didn t have to wait ages between each course  
positive; I enjoyed the food  it was good but I wouldn t rant and rave about how amazing it was  I ve had better  I would recommend to try the restaurant at least once  The desert was my absolute favourite  one of the best deserts I ve had  I can t remember what it s called  I just remember it had candy floss and popping candy   it was so good  The decor is nice  I will be returning as I want to try something else from their menu  
positive; We arrived without a reservation and the venue was bursting at the seams  We asked the waiter if we could get a table  for two  and he advised that he could offer us two seats and if we were happy to order drinks and he would move us to a table when one became available  He was attentive and we were ordering our food within about half an hour of our arrival  The food was good and there were plenty of options available   perfect for an informal meal or a meet up with friends  
positive; We have just got back from a short break at the Plume of Feathers  which we chose as a base for day visits along the idyllic Norfolk coastline with our  Dalmatians   The pub was ideal  recently refurbished it has a homely feel and the staff were really friendly and accommodating to us and our dogs   We ate at the pub most nights as the food was fresh and tasty   We had breakfast included in our stay which was great and set us up brilliantly for our days out   The room suited us and the dogs perfectly  cleaned daily and with plenty of complimentary tea coffee etc   The shower had a glitch one morning  but after mentioning it to Paul  he had a maintenance man there before we finished breakfast  and and a brand new shower installed before we returned from our day out   Now if that isn t fantastic service I don t know what is Paul and his team are working wonders with the place and it had a great atmosphere every evening with locals visiting and the rooms full  all managed by a very hard working and obviously tight knit team    Thanks Paul and staff 
positive; Had very welcoming and friendly staff on my visit  Had taken my friend who had never been before and was pleased I chose the Adam   Eve pub  Lovely friendly staff  good ambience and good food  
positive; We popped in here en route for a glass of wine and a plate of antipasti and we were not disappointed  The waitress initially recommended a glass of Gerwurtztraminer  it was not to our taste so when I asked if there was an acceptable alternative  she took careful note of what we wanted and I was immediately invited to taste what I can only describe as the finest Gavi for the price I think I ve ever been offered in London  We asked for an off menu small platter and were given a generous portion of mortadella  salami  gorgonzola  peccorino and bread  all of which were top quality  The icing on the cake was when a side of roast porccino suddenly appeared on the bar top  I asked if I could take some home  This was no problem at all  a side of it was sliced and packed away for me to take home and it s as tender as the suckling pig I ve eaten in Sardinia    My only misgiving is that the quality is so high  I fear they are not charging enough to stay in business  
positive; We stayed for  nights at The Snake Pass Inn back in October  The pub had a really homely feel and the staff were really friendly and helpful  The accommodation was a little tatty  and there was an issue with the shower in our room  so that the floor was soggy round the shower tray  However the price reflects the standards of the rooms and the breakfast more than made up for the issues  In an area with so much to do  its unlikely that you will stay for long in the room anyway  
positive;Enjoyed our visit here  Staff were lovely and attentive  So nice to see a selection of gluten free options available but I was disappointed they d run out of gluten free bread for sandwiches    it was late in the day pm  I had two GF scones instead which where the best I ve had in a tea shop 
positive; We had an excellent evening meal  good selection on menu at reasonable prices and good quality food  The staff and service was first class  Very enjoyable and good atmosphere  
positive; I flatter myself that I am fairly well travelled and one thing that I have noticed is that when I eat food here in the UK that is supposed to be from the countries I have visited it very rarely tastes like the food I had when I was there  Cachumba is different  I could really taste the influences from places like Thailand and India  The service was great and really friendly  I would definitely eat here again  
positive; Went for lunch with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed this venue  Nice host  good food and a pleasant atmosphere  The food was tasty  fresh and authentic  I was not familiar with the menu and the host was happy to make recommendations Highly recommend for a chaneg there are to many  quot soggy sandwiches quot  on offer in Marlborough and this made a refreshing change  
positive; Really beautiful Lebanese food  a fantastic range of options on the menu  Plenty for vegetarians  My favourites are the deliciously tangy Fatoush salad with crispy thin bread croutons  cheese borekas and wonderful hummus  Disappointing wine selection however  and only available by the bottle  apart from a very limited selection of house wines   the glass of house white I ordered tasted like vinegar    
positive; I go here with my partner almost every week  The price is amazing and the food is lovely  This seems to be the only place we eat because we know we like the food  Would recommend it to anyone  and I d recommend the Ribs and Chicken  Ribs are delicious  But everything I ve ate in there is lovely  
positive; FM Mangal is an absolute must if you are in Camberwell and looking for a great kebab  A hot mixed meze starter for  is just    and then you can get a great kebab  rice  mixed salad and chips for around    Great strong Turkish coffee also  One thing I love about this restaurant is the  freebies free hot flat bread [with the best  secret  flavour ever] served with a bowl of free griddled onions in a red sauce  they give you a slice of pineapple after your meal also   and a little cube of Turkish delight  I love these sort of touches  The staff are great  happy to help and very attentive  I love eating here  
positive; superb ciabatta rolls ideal for a light lunch Thestaff were very helpful especially with the wine choice  
positive; It was a Monday afternoon  about   that we attended and the restaurant was very quiet  The waitress welcomed us cheerfully and helped us with any menu queries  I had the fillet steak  which I was told was normally served medium so I said fine but what I received was definitely rare  I didn t mind this as the meal was lovely but could put some off  Overall a nice meal before going on to other places in the evening  
positive; Stayed here for  nights whilst working in the area  There is a nice pool and gym  My room was lovely  large with a comfy bed and a balcony  The food was very good but a bit pricey  The staff were great  even finding me some chocolate when I had a chocolate attack late one night  
positive; We were given a very cheery greeting by one of the staff as we entered the shop  even though she was busy  which was great    I was surprised and very pleased to find some vegetarian options on the menu considering the name of the restaurant  My friends thoroughly enjoyed their burgers  I chose one of the veggie options  The Shroom Burger  which was lovely  We each had a side order of chips  which were very nice but we couldn t manage to eat them all  one bowl of chips and one bowl of onion rings would have been enough to share between  of us   The onion rings were huge and nice and crispy  The buns are made locally   We all enjoyed our meal and would definitely eat there again  
positive; When you think of curry houses you imagine smallish  unassuming places  perhaps nestled between a newsagents and a local chippie: the dining equivalent of slipping on a familiar pair of faithful  if a little threadbare  slippers  Devdas  however  does away with this image: it sits proudly back from the main road  unflanked by tertiary industry of any kind  and a few minutes  walk from St Albans  shopping centre  like the patriarch of St Albans curry houses  In fact  the only allusion to it being a curry house at all are the cheerful and reassuringly kitsch pink neon lights in the windows   Inside  there s a little bar and seating area    used mostly by the many collectors of takeaways  they don t deliver   The rest of the restaurant is on a split level  giving a pleasant  spacious and uncluttered feel  again atypical of your usual curry house  In lieu of fake plastic table greenery there are single elegant stems  OK  slightly naff and Pizza Express y  but still  The wall art  too  makes a noble effort to be contemporary and chic  but somehow smacks of Ikea triptych  In a sense  though  if the place  were  really and truly swanky  as perhaps aimed at by the management  it wouldn t be anywhere near as charming   Food wise  you re in for a treat  The starters are varied and exciting  if a little ungenerous  with the Salmon Dudar and Samander Ki Crab making for a deliciously fishy start to our meal  The chef s specials are a definite highlight    again  offering huge diversity and some unorthodox options for the more adventurous among you  such as La Jawab and Koweabad    Service was a little slow  probably because it was a rammed  even on a Wednesday night   but extremely earnest and friendly  Prices are very reasonable indeed  particularly considering the quality of the food  and the atmosphere just plain rocks  Highly recommend 
positive; Me and my husband wanted to try Reds  as he loves this style of food and had heard great things about it  We arrived at the restaurant about  o clock on a Friday  and were told by the very helpful guy on the door that there was approx   hours wait for a table  He took our number and said he would call us when the table was ready  He had anticipated this  so it was no problem  We went and tried one of the fab bars nearby and after about an hour we were called to say our table was ready  I have got to say I think this way of doing things is genius   It means the restaurant is always full and buzzing  and you don t have to wait in a cold doorway for a table  More restaurants should do this  When we arrived we had a drink  I had the lager mixed with tomato juice  lime and hot sauce and it was amazing  and perused the menu  We had nachos to share to start with  and then we had the pulled pork with slaw  and the beef brisket  We shared some sides  fries  onion rings  pit beans and cornbread  My husband absolutely loved everything we had  as I said this is his ideal food type s he was in his element  I enjoyed it too  Highlights for me were the brisket and the nachos  Everything was fresh and cooked to order  The service was great  our waitress was knowledgable about the food  friendly and didn t rush us at all  although the restaurant was packed  The prices are reasonable too  All in all  a great place to go  
positive;Went to their party on saturday and had a really great night with my friends  It s an awesome loctaion but as  quot richlondon quot  said before  the queue was quite long  We met some nice people and the atmosphere was nearly perfect furthermore the staff were really attentive  So if you like RnB HipHop I d definitely recommend  quot SMASH quot   each saturday   On top of this the cocktails are super tasty  For me it s one of London s best clubs and we will definitely join another of their parties  As the pictures are not the best I can tell you that the interior is really nice and comfortable as well  xxxxx
positive; We have enjoyed eating in this little cafe twice  the first time I had a lunch pavlova and the second time we both had breakfast  My husband had the veggie breakfast and I had bacon and eggs of  my choice   both meals were excellent  high quality beautifully presented food for a reasonable price  The ambiance of the cafe is pleasant and there is also seating outside  the staff were very polite and helpful  
positive; The menu had a reasonable selection both during the evening and for breakfast  Having a very small appetite I was delighted to be able to choose a children s meal which they happily served me  Staff were attentive  
positive;We arrived here on a sat night after looking around many other place to eat  but everything else was full  We had been watching the football in the pub attacthed to the restaurant so decided to give it a go  It was very busy but they managed to squeeze us in  we ordered our drinks and which came quickly    We ordered the sharing plate to start with and this was very tasty  we both then ordered pizza s and a side order of chips   the pizza s were nice but wouldn t bother with the chips as they are just frozen chips   Overall was pleased that we tried this place as was nicer than expected 
positive; The dolphin has a buzzing atmosphere  is dog and child friendly and serves a good pint of beer and an above average glass of pub wine  
positive;Friendly cafe decorated in s style with movie posters decorating the walls  We visited during Halloween and it was covered in spiders  cobwebs and ghosts   Amazing array of deserts and ice creams with something for everyone and if you want something more substantial you can have a huge hot dog  Delicious  I had a knickerbocker glory and the friendly waitress kindly added a lit candle and sang as it was my birthday  Good service and nice and clean 
positive; As a local and a fairly frequent visitor to Costa I have never had a problem  I often go in early morning and the staff are friendly and very efficient  As with any establishment there are regulars and if there were any problems people just wouldn t go in  Customers  quot regular quot  orders are remembered and a lot of them are office workers buying their early morning take away to start their working day  I never pass Costa without seeing it busy and as there is more than enough choice for a coffee in Whitstable they must be doing something right   
positive; Great food but overpriced in my opinion  The service was very attentive with the waiter being very knowledgeable about the food  
positive; Gurkha kitchen has some stand out dishes  pork Bangoor and Ra Se are two of my favourites  and the breads are delicious  I would also recommend the momos as a starter  Nepalese dumplings   
positive;I visited with a few friends and had a very relaxed time with great food  Not expensive and you can take your own drink in to keep the cost down even further
positive; We had made a reservation for pm  However  although we arrived on time our table was only ready at  pm  making us feel like have a reservation or not didn t really make a difference Once tha was solved  all was good  The hot pot was very good and highly recommended  
positive; We had a great time here   the staff were brilliant  The range of options is good   healthy choices included on the menu   and the drinks selection is better than expected  
positive;We came here for lunch as we didn t like the prospect of turning up in a taxi and waiting for hours with no other place to go as you can t book a table    I have to say that the chaat  yoghurt bomb and bhel  and sticky chicken wings were exceptional  So good in fact that despite the other food being variable we will come back and try more dishes    The lamb chops were tasty but a poor quality chop with very little meat and mainly bone and fat  The potato curry was made with the wrong type of potato therefore becoming like mashed potato and tasted like it was just covered in tomato ketchup    It s such a shame that you can t count on a table being available to enjoy the yummy cocktails and interesting food with a group of friends in the evening 
positive;We were expecting great food but got a great theatrical show instead  The first disappointment of the night was the realisation that we can t choose what we want any more and have to go for the tasting menu  The tasting menu consisted of a multitude of spectacular but not delicous dishes  some of which I would have never chosen in a million years  The pigeon  for example  I found really unpleasant and couldn t eat after the first bite  I am sure it was cooked perfectly and I simply don t like pigeon  so it would have been really nice to be able not to choose to have it  My advice is  go there once if you want to experince it  it certainly felt like people do exactly that  as everybody around us was taking pictures   but don t go there if all you want is some really good food 
positive; Very good atmosphere  Loved that you could see your fish before it was cooked   was able to choose it for yourself  Also liked that we could watch the chef s at work  Although at times became a little smokey   quite warm if you were sitting fairly close to the kitchen area  Our waitress was very nice   made suggestions on what was her personal favourite of the menu   I ended up having the Seafood Tagliatelle  which was very filling  I had expected there to be a little more seafood but it was lovely anyway  the sauce was divine   he scallops were cooked to perfection  The squid was a little too chewy though   Overall had a great time  with great food for a great value  Will definitely be returning  
positive; Yummy desserts    The interior isn t very decorative but the place is always quite busy   They have a big picture of Bradley Cooper on their window so  we can t complain too much    The glasses of water you get are really quite small  which aren t enough really  but you can just ask for more    Prices are quite high but then it is in Leicester Square Overall  I would recommend because it is tasty  
positive; Large restaurant and very busy on a Friday night  Menu changes with the seasons  Food is cooked fresh and tasted excellent  Only gripe is they only give you  hours and we felt very rushed to finish our meal  We do not feel we could have eaten any faster  Best to avoid Friday and Saturday nights  
positive; I thought that perhaps we would be paying for the view rather than the quality of the meal  However I was really pleased that the food was also fantastic   The waitstaff were lovely  We had booked an earlier sitting so even though they needed the table back  they moved us to the bar and we even received complimentary petit fours as a thank you for moving   not necessary but a lovely thought    It s a lovely place which has a sense of occasion about it while it sits well with Cornwall s casual atmosphere    Have recommended to the whole family and will be back next year  
positive;Had a fab meal   very large portion  Aldi provide free taxis service both ways from our hotel  Just great 
positive; We have been here many times over the years and have never been disappointed with the food  The starters and desserts are smaller than average  but I don t mind this as the main courses are plentiful  so I go home feeling full  but not overstuffed  The fixed menu is terrific value at    for  courses  We came here to celebrate my son s st with the family and there were  of us  We all thoroughly enjoyed the food and the atmosphere  The only reason I haven t given it an excellent rating is because you can t order drinks at your table  which can be a pain sometimes  However  despite this  the service is super quick and the waiting staff are polite and friendly  We will definitely be returning soon  
positive; Pleasant looking pub  offering a typical pub menu  Loads of offers eg  Pleanty of choice  to suit most people Tables could do with a bit more of a clean between customers  as a bit sticky   Food arrived all together  no one had any complaints with what they had ordered  Hot   tasty and large portions  We didn t feel rushed  even though it was the end of the evening  The staff remain cheerful and pleasant though out   Would go back if we want nice pub meal 
positive; Great night in Bloo  for Office night out  Pizzas were great and food service was excellent  Slight delay at the bar but as expected for Cocktail service  Even better are the deals on food and drinks  Highly recommend   
positive; Wonderful food  Really tasty and reasonably priced  Staff were very friendly and helpful  Shall definitely return  Complimentary drinks after the meal and soft drinks being refilled were a bonus  Love that this is walking distance from where I live  A great local Indian restaurant  
positive; This was my first visit to Gusto it won t be my last  I was taken by a family member who goes quite often and her enthusiasm was not misplaced  I truly couldn t fault anything from pleasant young staff to delicious food  
positive; We hired the Stable Room for my husbands birthday gathering Great styling in the room    It is ready to go with no need to add much else  We were well looked after by Roz and her team  Also like the style of the main bar but prefer to visit at off times as it gets super busy 
positive; We decided to try this place out last night  Great decision  It is quite honestly one of the best Indian take aways we have ever had  Well cooked  very tasty and exactly what it said it would be  We tried the King Prawn Tava   never had it before it was fab huge meaty prawns    Two mains  one rice and a naan was very ample for two people  We will definitely go back  We collected so can t comment on delivery  We decided to collect because no one can ever find our house so it was far easier  
positive; Good food pleasant atmosphere Nice greek backround music Tried the musakas dish together with some starters keftedes and tzatziki delicious  Reasonable prices  
positive; This was our second visit to the restaurant  both for my July birthday  We had tried to visit again but it was fully booked  The food was exceptionally good and even excellent  I thought the dessert  lemon tart decorated with half a walnut and two cherries  was disappointing in its presentation after the beautifully presented previous courses    However a year ago some aspects of the service did not match the price of the food  We hoped it had improved but if anything it was even worse  Each problem was small but added up to our feeling very irritated and coming home for tea and coffee so that we did not face another disappointment  For example we asked for the drinks list but were never asked what we would like  We would return for the food but sincerely hope that the waiting staff pay attention to our and other customers  comments and remember how to offer a higher standard of service next time to match the price and food  If the service matched that of lower priced restaurants  that would be good enough  
positive; Great place for a mooch about  lots to see and fab displays   great cafe  bit pricey for me  There are some good offers if you ve time to look about  Worth a visit for sure  
positive; I met a friend here for afternoon tea on a Sunday which is served from  pm onwards   the place was buzzing  with people having drinks at the bar  dinner  afternoon tea and just a coffee whilst reading the paper  The decor is also beautiful  The hot chocolate and chocolate serving stick were divine  I would return simply for this    and afternoon tea a delight  A selection of sandwiches  scones and miniature desserts including a tart  chocolate mousse  crispy cake  and brownie  I left feeling full and happy  Looking at the other customers meal choices I will be sure to return for dinner soon  
positive; This really impressed me  My friends brought me here for my birthday  It had a really good atmosphere and the food was really nice  Interesting music playing in the background too  
positive; Chose this restaurant for my birthday meal  Really nice home run Italian  food was lovely and for a Thursday night they were quite busy so the restaurant had a nice atmophere  
positive; I ve been to Pizza Express before and remember the pizza being nicer than I experienced at this branch  The starter and dessert were nice however  and the waiter was lovely if a bit nervy  would have left my number if I was a bit braver and had a pen  We were seated straight away and our orders taken and food brought in no time at all  The sicilian still lemonade was very nice  give it a try  All in all we enjoyed our evening  the music they played was recent and popular so my brother and I had a bit of a laugh singing along  
positive;I have visited here a couple of times for lunch  always mid week  This time we went on a Saturday lunchtime and it was much busier  However  we only waited for a few minutes for a table to be cleared and set  The staff were very busy and I had to ask for our order to be taken  The staff were cheerful and friendly though  The food arrived quite quickly and as always the starters were huge but very tasty and nicely presented  Our main courses were also cooked to a high standard and arrived hot  As it was so busy  it seemed very noisy and we struggled to hold a conversation   Excellent food and good value  Will be going back again
positive; Came here on a Saturday night without a booking so was pleased we could get a table straight away  The service was brilliant throughout the night  out waitress Jade was so attentive and couldn t have done anymore for us  Food was delicious  only thing which let s the place down is the price  We paid about   for two mains and two puddings which is definitely more than your average restaurant  Definitely worth going to though  
positive;when we arrived here they realised they had double booked us  we were gutted to say the least as my boyfriend was over for the weekend from abroad to meet my family so it was a special occasion  After   min wait and drinks downstairs they finally seated us upstairs  although we were next to a really loud table of girls   birthday or hen party  Food was very good and waiter was really courteous  would go back
positive; My husband and I went to this restaurant on th May and had a really nice meal  The food was well cooked and reasonably priced and we would certainly go again  The lobster was cooked to perfection and my simple grilled halibut was delicious and fresh  Would go again    building is in need of a refit but I understand they have planning for this to take place  
positive;My husband and I had the eggs Benedict here which was to die for  Thoroughly recommend trying it  Sadly service does falter when they are busy  at lunchtimes this seems to be   But always good quality food and the staff in the farm shop butcher are also very friendly and helpful    Also be sure to have a cake on your way out  they are amazing 
positive;We went to Asiana yesterday for the lunch deal   for I have been a couple of times before but  of the  who dined with me had not been before   As always the service was wonderful  a lovely greeting and seated swiftly   It was very quiet   The only downside to Asiana is I do find they are not the fastest getting food out  however I assume that is as it is cooked form fresh    the food is heavenly  Our party agreed the Indian surpassed the Italian element  but by far one of the best Curries in town I look forward to my next visit 
positive; Visited this deli three times whilst staying in Liverpool recently  The food is very good and they serve some interesting options  try the Po Boy baguette excellent   The attached deli stock some interesting food  A special mention for the waiter Angus  who was very friendly and knowledgable about the extensive beer menu they stock  
positive;Visiting Haworth with a dear friend we stopped at The Stirrup on the walk up to the craft fair and it was full  So we visited the crat fair and walked back down to find empty tables so we stopped for afternoon tea  Very pleasant  Sandwiches very tasty  scones were so light  Very friendly and efficient staff 
positive; Thatchers Cider    enough said   and the Inn has something for all   nice garden chilled atomosphere in the summer 
positive; I used to work here when it first opened and it hasn t lost its charm  very cosy  food could be better 
positive;Staff friendly  good service  Great location  They serve glutton free pizza  Found a little expensive 
positive; Just outside the hustle and bustle of Padstow  Therefore I would suggest that if you want Rick Steins fish and chips this is a much quieter option  When we were here we walked straight in and ordered  however the garden is huge and on sunny days would be able to cope with lots of visitors but you may have to wait for food  Not the best fish and chips in the world but as would appear in most of Cornwall this place is also dog friendly  No need to book  
positive; For a buffet style restaurant the food is pretty good  loads of selections  salads  italian  asian  indian  mexican etc  and plenty of deserts  The table service is pretty good  drinks arrive quickly  although their are several food in the buffet that you will need to line up and wait for  but worth it  as your pasta mexican etc will be personalised with the ingredients you want   Good for large parties of casual dinning  
positive; Went for Sunday lunch with my partner and  year old grandson  Food is excellent with a good choice and specials boards  They have a cavery with a choice of either turkey  ham or roast beef with a selection of vegetables  yorkshire pudding  roast potatoes and new potatoes  my only dissapointment was they didnt offer mash potatoes  Not yet tried a dessert there so cant comment on that  Its a pleasant pub which can get very busy on Sunday lunch times so would advise booking in advanced  Nice location next to the canal  would be nice on a sunny afternoon watching the boats go by  Reasonably priced and good service  
positive; Every time we come to Weymouth we have to visit Prezzos  its a firm favourite with the grand children who love the pizzas and puds on offer   
positive; The staff was so friendly  I almost wished I worked with them  A bit pricey for what it offers  but at least the fun is guaranteed  I will definitely be going back  
positive; Family friendly pub in centre of small town  Worth going for light lunch which includes a drink good choice  Plus if you like a larger meal they have a varied menu  
positive;Having visited this restaurant  times since it opened I felt compelled to say what a brilliant little place this is  I have been to the restaurant with girl friends and family and each time have been impressed with the kind and attentive service and good value food on offer here  I took advantage of the course menu last Saturday night   what a bargain  and found a % off voucher for last Wednesday for my son s menu  Despite being a chain Pizza Express offers a wonderful service in Skipton and I will continue to visit 
positive; this cafe serves very good food at reasonable prices and has a very well close to funny girls and a few minutet from the sea friendly staff  It is situated in the north end of Blackpool  opersit 
positive; We went to the Jintana on a Friday night and although it was busy and we hadn t booked we got a table without having to wait  The restaurant is small and tables are packed tightly together  The food was simple but delicious  Chicken Phad Thai and Sweet and Sour Chicken were both full of flavour  I thought it was very good value for authentic Thai food  The staff were generally very helpful and courteous  A small point  it would have been nice to have been able to have a jug of water for the table  Instead water was brought to the table in a jug  poured into our glasses and then taken away again  
positive; Delicious food but I feel given the alternatives the food is quite pricey here  But if you are after Thai then this is a the place to eat it  Fantastic papaya salad   nice and spicy and fresh  
positive;We love Gabriel s Wharf  but had never eaten in this restaurant before  Both inside and out it could do with decorating  up dating and possibly better lighting inside  That aside  the kitchen and toilets were clean  The food was brought up hot  and as listed in the menu  by friendly chatty staff  The pizzas were all great and tasty with a good base and plenty of topping  The seafood pasta  think it was linguini  meal was better than expected with plenty of fish and taste  Accompanied by Peroni beer and soft drinks it went down well  The deserts are very good and it is great you can buy a coffee and a smaller portion of desert together  The smaller portions were still pretty large  We ate outside on a pleasant day under one of the large umbrellas with heaters warming our heads  The terrace is quite small and we were lucky to get a table for four  I am not so sure we would have been happy eating inside  The bill was slightly more than we expected but we had a great time 
positive;Enjoyed a delicious meal at this centrally located restaurant in the market town of Shepton Mallet  Very tasty and generous portions 
positive;I visited with my friend for afternoon tea on Monday   we were worried after reading the previous reviews but when we arrived we were greeted by a lovely waitress who sat us  we couldn t get over how beautiful the building was  When are afternoon tea arrived we where told to our surprise that everything was home made even the bread it was delicious  We LOVED it an we will definitely be returning  Hats off to the chef or the lovely food and thank you to the waitress for making are afternoon so enjoyable  Don t knock this place till you have tried it yourselves if we had gone by the previous reviews we wouldn t of gone but we are so glad we did  See you soon merchants
positive;Always friendly  really helpful  Have a pub quiz on a Monday  Food is very nice and there is a lot of choice  They also have  on top of the menu a glass cake displY and they look amazing   I like the hunters chicken   We usually go to the three linda once a fortnight  They have a good mid week offer on part of the menu  buy two for   thus is a very good deal  especially with a big family  I wish they wouldn t put balloons up   or use foil ones instead of latex rubber  Oh yes and very reasonable cocktails and lovely choices for wine 
positive; Italian is one of my fav food so I am always a little picky where I eat it This place is ahhhhmaaazing    Lively busy atmosphere  very Italian Great selection of dishes and very budget friendly    I absolutely love risotto di mare and this place does such a delicious risotto   to die for  All the dishes looked absolutely amazing   It s % a place to visit  Not a st date place as it s very loud so you don t really want to be having st date conversations or trying to get to know someone in a busy place Or if you really reaaaallllyyyy want to try this place they also do private dining  Will not regret it    
positive; Overall a good dinner but not my favourite place  The food was good but I did find some things so fragrant it became over powering  e g the coconut sticky rice didn t taste of coconut at all but lemon and lime  However the rest of our party really enjoyed the food  more than me  and overall it was very tasty   presentation was also very good  The service does let this place down a bit though  The staff seem a bit clueless as to what is going on   I was even asked what one of our dishes were  We had a few things turn up that weren t for us and then one of the mains was wrong and a few things missed  If the service could be a bit slicker and the staff more knowledgeable it would make a big difference  We did also found the music too loud  It needed to go down a knotch   or three  
positive; Wide ranging menu caters for all  Food is good quality tasty and good value  Staff friendly and helpful  Nice atmosphere if a little dark to read the menu  
positive;we decided to go out for tea on Saturday and chose the rufford arms as we have always been very happy with the service and the meals have always been very nice  Saturday was no different and the menu choice was very good as was the price  the waiting staff were all very pleasant indeed and nothing was to much trouble  we have been here at least six times for special occasions but for some reason the lady who owns the hotel seemed very abrupt on this visit   other visits she took the time to speak to you and ask if you enjoyed your meal but on this occasion when moving our plates she dident utter a word even though my husband spoke to her  it has put us off going again as one of the things we enjoyed about the rufford arms was the banter we had with the lady  I really hope it was just an off day or she will lose custom 
positive; We went early on a Saturday evening   we had pre booked but had to wait a while for the menus to be printed then the food took a long time to arrive  It was delicious though  and the staff were very friendly  
positive; Visited on a weekday lunchtime with a couple of friends  There were plenty of tables  and everything was nice   clean   bright  There are lots of things on the menu that looked yummy  I had a meatball panini   it was gorgeous  The service was good   not too long to wait for food  I d definitely go again  
positive; I often use this place for the lunch box  size are generous  good selection and always fresh  Most of the staff are friendly and always welcoming  
positive; Visited on a Saturday lunchtime  Food was lovely  big portions  I had a fish finger sandwich  expecting fish fingers actually got battered fish pieces  different but lovely  Quite a wait for the food to come but it was lunch time and very busy  Would definitely go again    
positive; Good service and good food  Slightly more expensive than our usual Indian but worth it  Nice decor  Would defiantly go back and take friends with us    
positive; A different style of pizza for those who fancy a change  You pay by the yard  Not cheap  but not too expensive  It s one of those novelty places you try a few times  but can get bored with  That s not to say you should not give it a go as some of the pizzas are amazing  
positive; We called into the restaurant regarding a query but stopped in the bar for a quick drink  The atmosphere  and furniture  was very comfortable and relaxing with a great view over the Marina  
positive;I really like the wide choices and willingness to substitute other things for dietary reasons   even though this may go a tiny bit wrong on occasion  However it is always put right with a smile so I have no complaints    The food is also very good and tasty and the restaurant seems to be well managed    The lunch offers available are varied and excellent value for money 
positive; I wish I had taken the name of the lovely waitresses who accommodated our group of  ladies on a hen night  The service was second to none  All but  meals arrived on time   the ladies were offered a complimentary drink during their wait  Everyone enjoyed their meal  Not fine dining but a tasty well presented variety of food  Wonderful ambience  great cocktails   a thoroughly enjoyable evening  
positive; We visited for a belated birthday brunch  and were not disappointed  Extensive menu with lots of delicious options  it was hard to choose what to have  Portions were a good size   eating a whole loaf of bread between two for a stater was  in hindsight an error   and very tasty  Can also thoroughly recommend the cocktails   It was quite busy when we visited  and we were seated by the bar  which was a little bit loud  but all in all a very enjoyable day  Although with the reservation you are allocated a  hour dining slot  we were not rushed out the door at the end of this time   which has happened in other restaurants  and ruins the experience somewhat  
positive; Husband and I were meeting friends by the river for a few drinks and wanted to find somewhere good to eat  Had a search online and found this restaurant with a great food deal   Was expecting to not like the set menu and opt for the standard menu  but we stayed with the set menu and we were not disappointed  There was a great selection  which was complemented by an amazing choice of wine   The restaurant itself is an amazing setting  with an open kitchen   The service was great and we wished that we had time to go to the bar for another drink  but sadly had to catch the last train home    If you are in this area  would highly recommend this restaurant for a visit  
positive; Out for a walk and popped in for snack  Had sharing platter which was tasty  However menu tends to be main meals  Pleasant surrounding sitting outside with quick service  
positive;We have had two lovely meals at the Chequers both on the special offer  fish and fizz on a Friday night   fish meals and a glass of prosecco each  The fish is lovely and the batter is so light and crispy  Gary loves it  he s had it twice  I had Scampi the first time and last week I had the fish pie  both were lovely but I would like to recommend the fish pie  We are looking forward to the lovely summer evenings to spend in the newly landscaped garden  We will be trying the A La Carte menu on a Saturday very soon   Thank you for the lovely welcoming service  Elaine and Gary
positive;This is a favorite among my friends and I  it caters very well for dinners and the burgers are great   The staff are always friendly and accommodating and the restaurant is always full  I would recommend the sliders so you can choose  of their great burger types in smaller sizes  Their  The End Game  cocktail is very good and will certainly liven up your evening 
positive; When approaching the restaurant from the main road the first car park you come to is at the back   so the nearest door is the back door  I have to admit it is not the nicest of entrances  There is a front entrance round the corner  far nicer  However once in the restaurant all that was forgotten  The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere and nice inviting fire  cosy  The waiter was very polite and efficient  The meal was delicious  we had home made artisan bread  butter and olives to share for starters  Then I had duck done two ways   pulled duck samosa and pan roasted breast  cooked perfectly with a cherry sauce  my partner had individual Guinness steak pie  the top crust of the pie was rather  well done  but he said the pie was very nice   both meals came with creamy mash and wilted spinach   Good ale on tap too  This is a little gem of a place  will certainly visit it again  
positive; Just near the station so with  time to spare  we went into this bright new restaurant Left two hours later with reluctance   train to catch  Thoroughly liked the glass of wine awaiting the food Simple tasty fare I  m sure I will be back 
positive;The Starbucks in Fleet is well located and nicely appointed  The outside seating is set into an alcove in the street and is pleasantly private 
positive; Great for a pub lunch and pretty inexpensive  Standard pub menu  plenty of choice with some good offers throughout the week  Decor and facilities all new so no complaints there  Great if you have kids as there is a separate children s area to the rear of the pub and equally great if you haven t got kids as they re tucked away  Loads of room both inside and out although parking can be an issue as its a popular place  Good service and love the option to take your dessert home   brilliant  
positive; I ate at this restaurant last night having been invited for a birthday dinner  I only had a main as did the rest of the group but the food was amazing  A variety of dishes were ordered and the seafood linguine which I ordered was delicious  Portions were more than reasonable and there is a range of dishes that cater for vegetarians as well  Food arrived promptly which made things even better   Staff are friendly and made the dining experience easy and pleasant   A lovely lovely restaurant in the heart of the city with a great atmosphere whether celebratory or romantic  
positive; Visited Bill s for the first time for a late lunch just before Christmas  Food was good but would have liked more vegetarian options  Good service   friendly staff  
positive; I booked the private dining room for a surprise birthday party for my wife   There were  of us and the private dining room was the perfect size for that number  it is downstairs and you are surrounded by the different wines  The atmosphere is great as you have a mini cellar one end and a small kitchen at the other end  You can also make as much  or little  noise as you want without disturbing anyone   The room is free  although the meal is not particularly cheap   The lady who I booked the room with was very helpful and accommodating  and helped with the wine choices which were very good value for money   We had to pre order the food and one dish changed on the night to Rabbit   which isn t to everyone s taste   This was a little disappointing but not a show stopper    The Food was OK  but it wasn t a topic I heard anyone passionately discussing  some of the mains were served slightly cold and my lamb was pretty chewy and fatty  Although it was all brought out quickly   All in all we had a fantastic night  the venue was perfect for the occasion  and something I would defiantly consider doing again   Also there is a karaoke bar opposite you can move into once you have had enough wine   
positive; Lovely  friendly  unpretentious and good value  The staff are really friendly and pleasant  I love that dogs are allowed  Sunday lunch was good value and well done  
positive; On a weekend break to Cornwell we decided to have the traditional Sunday roast lunch   the arms was recommended to us and we were accommodated without a reservation Despite the fact that they were fully booked   The staff were great and the slow roast shoulder of lamb was delicious   My sister had the strawberry tart for desert which too was delicious   Great atmosphere and good value   
positive; Visited here after a long day in London with my daughter  The beer garden was busy so we had an indoor table  It took a little time to get served at the bar  the other end appeared to have more staff and they seemed unable to pass the halfway point  often serving customers who had arrived at the bar after we had  Between four of us we ordered two mixed bread starters  one would have been sufficient  The main courses were all piping hot when they arrived and the steaks were cooked to our liking  The  fish  on the fish and chips was a fillet and not a re formed triangle of fish bits  Chips and Wedges were all crisp and dry  I had to fetch my own cutlery  three sets were provided  and vinegar  
positive; I was very excited to visit tibits when I heard that it offered a buffet or food boat as they call it  Usually  one will not ever find buffets that offer good quality  but Tibits was a great surprise as their strictly vegetarian food  is not only healthy but also tastes great  There is a nice variety of selection  some of their dishes are quite different so be careful to look and read about them all before adding them to your plate  The food is not top of the top in quality  but it is pretty good considering its a buffet  Beware though  you pay by weight  so dont go overboard  Cocktails are a must as well   
positive; visited with family and friends   we were staying in the area visiting a family member  Great steaks and a good bottle of wine   great value  My steak was med rare not med as asked but that was quickly rectified   was a very good piece of meat  My daughter s rare was just what she was after  Would definitely go back  
positive; I remember The Elephant s Nest from when I was a teenager and used to drop in for a quick cider after a Sunday morning s horseriding nearby  The pub is now much more: lovely atmosphere with a few rooms to eat in  or outside in a lovely garden if the weather is good    You need to book these days because it is popular and busy   Food is very good: from a regular roast to a varied menu  with good veggie options  Puddings to die for  And the old dog  can t think of his name now   lolloping around makes you feel right at home  Well behaved dogs are welcome  by the way  
positive; We ate here after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disapointed  Very nice meal the curry tasted very fresh and full of flavour  the service was a little slow in taking our order but that wasn t an issue  A really nice reasonably priced meal and one of the best Curry places in Keighley  
positive;Visited the Anne Arms with family as we had heard the original chef after refurb had returned  we were not disappointed  the food was lovely  all cooked really well and piping hot  the menu could be bigger as it use to be but that did not spoil a lovely evening 
positive;We visited here at lunch time on a Tuesday it was very busy but the chefs worked fast to keep the carverey queue down  As with all carvereys You queue at the bar for a drink then queue again for your food  but once you have it  its lovely   not a huge choice of veg   but it was nice   certainly go again
positive; Our daughter treated us to Sunday lunch last weekend  We had no complaint about the food which was excellent  Sunday lunch is limited to a choice of three for main and desert  but there is plenty of choices during the week and the menu is adventurous and interesting  The staff were quite happy for our five year old granddaughter to have a smaller version of the dishes   But we had to wait far too long to be served after we had made our choices  Also it s so noisy  The bar and seating area is one huge room and there is nothing to absorb the noise of lots of chatting people  Maybe some sort of acoustic celling installation would help    But if you want a good Sunday lunch and don t mind waiting for it to arrive  give it a go  But don t take anyone with you who wears a hearing aid or is hard of hearing  
positive; Romano`s has a new manager who has really raised the standard of the food   Dishes are now made to order   using quality produce   with attention to detail and authenticity   The risotto genovese was excellent and the lemon cheesecake was the best we have tasted  An individual  ml   bottle of prosecco was a lovely treat   The ambience was also good with pleasant music at a volume which allowed conversation and attentive staff   Well done   
positive; Ate here one Sunday afternoon  service was good  food was decent and being able to sit outside so close to the seafront was a great bonus  
positive; The previous reviews mentioning price almost put us off from going    however  having enjoyed a delicious  authentic thai meal  my boyfriend and I came to the same conclusion  you get what you pay for   We shared the vegetarian hot platter to start and followed this by the Tiger Prawn curry  v spicy  with sticky rice and a delicious pork and vegetable noodle dish  The portions were ample and we did not have any room to try the array of desserts on offer   The service was very good at the atmosphere in the restaurant was v pleasant   I would certainly recommend Thai Edge Leeds to all lovers of Thai food   don t be put off by the price   if you re going out for a treat  it s certainly worth it  
positive; Pleasant people and quick service    lovely little cozy place  Love the homemade scones and clotted cream  Will definitly go back and highly recommended  
positive; Can t get a yummier pizza   i d recommend the chicken pizza   small chips  The only bit of constructive critisism i have is charging to put sauce on the pizza i e garlic  ketchup 
positive; This was a nice place for a coffee  seated outside  or maybe a meal but the prices looked on the high side  but if you re on holiday then I m sure it would be fine  
positive; I love the food from Spartan  All tastes freshly made  Great starters   nann breads  However my favourite was the lamb samosas  which they have recently changed from being very nice  large homemade ones to measly tiny frozen ones  They used to be value for money but now they charge more for what is essentially  samosas out of a bumper frozen pack  It s cost cutting like this which can cause people to turn their loyalties elsewhere  Perhaps its just their current chef staffing problems that has caused them to look for easier options  although this doesn t account for their sudden price hikes  
positive; Inside decor nondescript  but the view from our table was great and the service and food was outstanding  just get the designers in  and get some atmosphere into this great building  
positive; Great pub very friendly  Thanks for letting me charge my phone   The locals almost persuaded us to stay longer and get the bus back to Hele but so glad we walked the coastal path amazing views  
positive; We ve just been here for lunch we don t know Belper but had been for a walk and wanted some lunch  This place looked nice from the outside and didn t mind our muddy boots and it turned out to be a good find  The staff were friendly and the food was obviously cooked with care  I had really good fish and chips which came with lovely minted mushy peas and good tartare sauce  homemade I think   while my partner had the vegetarian aubergine stack which also came with chips and a nicely dressed mixed salad  
positive;Beautiful grounds  very well kept  Looks gorgeous and autumnal  Only downside was loose farm dogs scrounging for food and bothering visiting dogs who are on leads   besides this it was a lovely visit 
positive; They do the basics right by using fresh ingredients and cooking them well   It s amazing how many other companies manage to get this wrong but the guys at Highlands have it nailed down and as a result the fish and chips they sell are damn tasty   Portion sizes are good as well  so you ll not go hungry after a meal there  
positive;I love this place  Set high above Poole Harbour   if you are lucky and get in early  or better still reserve a table  you can watch the boats on the water or the people on the quay  while enjoying lovely food and wine  The waiters will chat in Italian  English  sometimes Portuguese and are always friendly and helpful  The atmosphere is very  Italian  as it the food  All freshly cooked and delicious
positive;We love Sanho  A wide range of choice  good prices  freshly made  Look beyond the sparse dÇ¸cor and lack of atmosphere  and embrace what this place does so well   noodles 
positive; In the old mill building so looked interesting and welcoming from outside  Spotted the menu outside with reasonable prices main  and thought we d go for it  Between the two of us we had soup  fish pie  cod  chocolate mouse  sticky toffee pudding  All very much worth the good prices we paid  Waitress  Adriana  was fantastic   attentive with a smile but not smothering  thank you    Restaurant filled up so book  
positive; We ve visited here  times now and loved it every time  The poppodums and pickle tray are so tasty and that fills us enough without a separate starter  The garlic rice is a must and most of the dishes we ve tried   we ve definitely have again  The only tip we d give it to buy wine buy the bottle and not buy the glass   we saved nearly a tenner by doing this after our first trip  The staff are friendly without being too over the top  
positive; We stayed her just for  night on the May Bank Holiday and it was excellent  Our room was gorgeous and the bed very comfortable  We had dinner bed and breakfast for   Dinner was really good and breakfast was one of the best that i have had  We will definately be returning  
positive;We ve been here a few times now and every time we are happy with the service  Always friendly and the food is always spot on  Both myself and my boyfriend love the Oreo shakes   And have started using the app to collect points 
positive; Went here for dinner with my boyfriend last night  So many great things on the menu so it was hard to pick  I went for the crab tacos and my fella had the fried chicken to start  I tried some of his chicken and had serious food envy as it was delicious and practically melted in my mouth  I also wish that I had ordered that gingerbread milkshake that he had  If you go there then you must try it   Whilst waiting for our food I had a nosy at the cocktail menu and I wished that I had left my car at home so I could have one  There are lots of really yummy sounding flavour combinations such as the Jack   Ginger and the Honey Pot   For mains we both had burgers  Mine was the  quot nd Best Cheeseburger quot  and my fella went for the  quot Geek Burger quot  which had peanut butter and a fried egg on  Both burgers were really tasty and they definitely don t skimp on the meat  We were too full for dessert which was a shame as they had some excellent options that I would like to have tried   The place has a great atmosphere and the staff are have always been super friendly when we ve visited  Definitely recommend this restaurant and plan to go back for my fellas birthday in a couple of months  
positive;To appease the hungry beasts that my children were going to turn into  we decided to have lunch with my sister  her children and my kids  We were a party of  and luckily found seating right away  There were a lot of Asian diners which to me is a good sign  Portions were good  We had the crispy noodles with chicken and veggies  Tasty  Then my son had the noodle soup he polished it off  Toilets could certainly be improved  We will go back to try other dishes  A hole in the wall not fancy  Just the way we like it 
positive;My other half dragged me up the tiny steps on our anniversary knowing how much I love chocolate  It was comical as at  quot   he s not a tiny man and those steps are tiny   very quaint little tea shop  on first inspection of the menu his lordship muttered about Greggs being cheaper  but it was windy and cold   We both ordered a panini   from the smiley friendly waitress   the man had tea and I had to have one of their famous hot chocolates   The panini appeared   along with a better than average side salad  colslaw and crisps  At this point his lordship was impressed  Greggs wouldnt have done after all  The price wasnt that high for what we had better than Costas   and it was all in pleasant surroundings  The cakes in view looked lovely   after a week or so eating everything on holiday though I was waving the white flag at too much glutony  The waitress was also very knowlegable about the building and what it used to be etc  She was more than happy to talk to tourists  we also visited the chocolate shop downstairs expensive  we only ended up with a handful of chocoates  We havent tasted them yet how i dont know 
positive; The Harrow is a great pub in the centre of Aylesbury town  The courtyard is nice to sit outside and have a drink  The burger menu is nice and the burgers are made on site  Great pub to come and watch the football  The lovely vibe in the day transitions to more of a club feel in the evening on the weekend  The bank holiday weekend socials are great events  All in all it is a pub for everyone that changes throughout the day  Dog friendly pub too 
positive; We went for the Thursday curry night  choice of about  curries for    each which included a drink as well  Service was excellent  the food arrived in about  minutes after ordering for the  of us   and was piping hot and very tasty  We sat in the upstairs area as this had more diners than drinkers but it was a little dark  
positive;Pretty place  Warm welcome from the cat   The owner told us the cat was a rescue cat  a lot of the gifts were cat inspired   I bought shell earrings to help the Gambia project  and postcards depicting the shop  Lots of lovely stuff for sale  but unable to carry it  
positive; Martini s is tucked away in a back street but hunt it out as it is a great place to go whether with friends  as a couple or with the family  Great food  lovely wine and a lovely interior  
positive; Typical English Cornish Pub  these are few and far between these days    Good hearty food  relaxed atmosphere  dogs  kids the lot  The Moules are exceptional  Easy to find as its just next to the only cash point 
positive; Me and my partner came to masala bazaar last week after being recommended by one of my colleague from work  Overall the food and atmosphere was excellent apart from service  We were given a warm welcome and allocated one of the corner table by the waiter  then he came back and brought us our drinks what we had ordered but it took a long time for him to take our food order even when both of us were ready long before  Finally the order was taken and starters arrived soon  but I was wondering where the waiter would disappear from reception suddenly   so for my curiosity I went to the reception and guess what both the waiters were sitting down behind the counter and busy with laptop but just a glance was enough for me to get my answer  To my surprise both of them were playing online bingo   Then suddenly shaking one of them asked how can I help you  I just said if you could get me another drink  What a shame guys I never expected this after being so highly recommend 
positive; If you are looking for a Brazilian steak house experience in Leeds  definitely you should go there and try it  It`s a all you can eat restaurant  including meat  salad bar and tapas  and the service is excellent  
positive; visited for a work mates th celebration  We all had the special banquet  Food was very good and the service was excellent nothing was too much trouble Rounded off by karaoke singing  great night  
positive; Was visiting family in the area and choose and booked the Lobster Pot via Tripadvisor  Arrived and served ever so quickly  Good wine list  Hubby had oysters with garlic butter for starters and i had the smoked salmon pate  both were delicious  Waiter served bread before starters  Great choice of fish  menu is wonderful but the specials board were immense again  I ordered half grilled lobster with garlic butter and hubby ordered scallops with cheese sauce  once again they were lovely and not over cooked  We will ensure we come back again when in the area  
positive; We ate here on Saturday night and were surprised how quiet it was although lots of people came for takeaways  The meal was very tasty  I particularly liked the hot and sour soup starter and beef in black bean sauce   well it was all very good  great rice and veg  Staff friendly but non intrusive  look forward to going back next time we re in Fowey  We are happy eating in quiet restaurants  hate crowds but I was disappointed for the restaurant they weren t busier  
positive; We visited for breakfast  The food was well cooked with yummy thick bacon and the toast was wonderful  Slight problem with my order handled promply and professionally  It is great to see a small business thriving and we would happly visit again and recommend it  
positive; Had lunch here with friends good service and good food but lacking in atmosphere as there was no other diners I think because we have so many places in Pocklington to have a meal and this place is more expensive for food you can get similar to elsewhere  they will end up struggling  
positive; Nice food  always great quality with plenty of good meat  Only thing they could improve is to have lime pickle   chilli added to the poppadoms chutneys 
positive;Fantastic atmosphere  staff were very attentive  Children welcomed Bouncy Castle included  Food very good 
positive; Visited with my dad recently  Very good service  delicious food  fairly speedy  Good choice in menu available  
positive;The venue is ina fantastic spot to walk along the river from London Bridge  The food itself is great value for money and the service is effecient  There are some good deals to be had here online 
positive; Clean and tidy coffee shop  Very chatty staff and polite  The cakes looked amazing and I gather taste fantastic  Bought a piece to take home  very good price value for money  
positive; Only visited for drinks on our way back to our hotel as it looked like it had a good atmosphere  Luckily found a table  Didn t have to wait long to get served at the bar even though there was a large queue  Drinks were lovely and had a good time  Visited again another night and had another good night in a place with a great and lively atmosphere  
positive; I love Quaglinos and have been going for some years but this was the first visit after the refurbishment  We weren t disappointed  The service is slick from being greeted and being taken to your table  One thing is  the ladies who take you to your table are in full length gowns a nightmare when trying to negotiate the staircase down to the restaurant  Having nearly come a cropper myself a couple of times over the years  my heart was in my mouth for her on two counts  one that she was going to trip and two  that I was going to stand on the back of her dress and we were both going to go  Safely seated we had a lovely champagne cocktail from the new downstairs bar  followed by a delicious meal  The service was really good and the staff friendly  Just one other thing  there are no tablecloths  It took me a while to realise what was missing  The tables are dark wood so it does make the place look rather dark but a small thing  There is also a stage where the seafood bar used to be and I believe there was rather good entertainment on later  Sadly we had to leave and missed it but I ll be better prepared next time  Has lost none of its glamour and is highly recommended  
positive; it was a busy evening for dinner  waiting  minutes  but the food was surprisingly good but the service was a highlight of the evening  Our waiter was Conor  he was so friendly  very genuine gave great recommendations and nothing seemed to bother him  It was obviously busy but with his service and personality you wouldn t have known  I would go back just for this kind of service as it can hard to come by  
positive; I organised a small luncheon event for  people in the Lounge Bar  The ambience since the refurbishment was great  the food tasty  the service excellent and and not lacking in attention or courtesy  Good value for money and everyone seemed to enjoy the dining experience  Well done The Marine Hotel  
positive; I visited here for the first time  There were three menus to chose from  so one is able to find a meal to suit any budget  It was fairly quiet which may have been why we found the restaurant to be really relaxing   The food was nice  but slightly overcooked  Lucy  who waited on us  was lovely and very welcoming   I am already planning my next visit 
positive; We were pleasantly surprised with the Duck and Waffle  and the truffle chicken was also a winner  Will definitely be going back again for these two dishes  The view from the restaurant is one of the best you ll get in London   The only let down was the service   the waiter mixed up the drinks and was actually quite rude about it  We were given vodka instead of gin and he almost made it seem as if we didn t know the difference between the two  Our other waiter also seemed quite confused  giving us the dessert menus straight after he had cleared our desserts   Overall  we had a great time and will be back  
positive; We arrived quite late and ordered quickly as we knew they stop taking orders at   pleasantly surprised as they said the meal might be half hour but was only  mins or so  I had a pie and it was delicious  the other meals were as lovely  lasagne  burger  and roast chicken  And we thought it was  Better than the buffet restaurant   
positive; Beautiful old hotel  with huge fireplaces and exposed beams  Great value and the special meal offer is a bargain  Good food  good service and friendly staff  We found Chris and George very helpful  
positive; I travelled around Italy   in my option the most authentic pizza I ve eaten in the UK since returning  Good value for money as well 
positive; Lovely CafÇ¸  spotted it the night before and came back for breakfast  also bought a nice sign from the shop as they sell lovely things for the home  
positive;One of my favourite tapa bar  Friendly staff and food is gorgeous  I had my th party there with  friends and we all had a brilliant time there  Highly recommended 
positive;I love a good old Nando chicken and always have   one thing I found odd though after speaking to a waiter   he SAID THE BOSSES OF NANDOS WORLDWIDE ARE BOTH VEGETARIANS   What do they see that s put them off chicken at what id like to know lol
positive; We ate well  the service was excellent  and the whole place made you feel you were part of a vibrant exciting night out  Lovely  
positive; I ve visited this restaurant several times and it doesn t disappoint  It has a really authentic Moroccan feel about it  the lighting is low with deep colours on the furnishings  Staff are friendly but not intrusive  Would recommend the buffet which has a good selection of starters  tagines  roast meats and desserts  It even has its own ice cream machine whereby you help yourself  They used to have belly dancers on occasion but not sure if they do now  Price of the buffet is reasonable around the    mark and you don t come out hungry  
positive; Very nice atmosphere  Been there a few years ago and now looks absolutely amazing :   Looking forward to return  for the next dinner  
positive; We arrived very late in the rain but we were welcomed with smiles and the food was first class  The steak was delicious  
positive; We have avoided this place for some time   possibly a couple of years  after  bad meal experiences  but I am glad to say we returned this week and to my delight sll three of us had a great meal and a good experience  The staff were friendly and helpful and the food realky good and reasonably priced  We will start going back now the food is better thank you  
positive;Capabilitea is a regular haunt for me and my mum meeting up and having a chat    Great friendly service always with a smile  the owner works her socks off and is there almost everyday   Cracking menu for cake lovers  light lunches or for those who need something a little more filling  Happy to accomidate dietary needs   Always a fab massive cup of coffee  what more can you ask for   And if your feeling more adventurous they serve out very own stoke oatcake with various fillings  I do recommend bacon and cheese though  after all that is the proper way to eat them  Small Childs play area inside  small selection of books for the lone diner  Large tables to fit a few people around and cosy sofas for the small party  Lovley clean toilet though it s a small cafe so there is only one  My only problem with this place is as soon as you walk through the door all mobile service disappears although it means you have to actually talk to the person your with so swings and roundabouts   Only four out of five as it s quite small and can get extremely busy in high season which means you can wait sometime for a seat 
positive; We booked a table for lunch on a Saturday for a family group which included a  year old and a  month old  We checked when we booked that this would be ok as we weren t sure that it would be a family atmosphere  They were more than happy for us to have the children there and we were made most welcome  There was a good childrens menu and baby changing facilities   I would say to readers though to not worry  the place is not filled with noisy kids  ours were the only ones there  The children s menu was not very long but had some classic options that would make any kid happy  My  year old had cod goujons which were very good quality but not fussy so he ate them happily  I would say that it would have been nice if there was more choice on the childrens menu   there were no starter options and pudding was just ice cream  I don t know whether it was because it was a set meal for around    or not but I didn t see anything else  As for the adults amongst us we mostly ordered off the set menu   course for I think    ish or  courses for around I had cajun chicken and bacon salad to start with and can quite honestly say it was the best salad I have ever eaten in my life  just delicious  perfectly dresses and generous with the meat  Several of my companions had the shredded duck salad and were just as enthusiastic about that  For main I had the burger  locally sourced  and really lovely  generous chips etc and nicely put together  I hate those burgers that either fall apart when you pick them up or are so stuffed you can t bite into them  Someone in our group had fish and chips which looked great  someone else had the gammon  not on lunch set menu  which looked really good  with lots on the plate  My husband had the bangers and mash which was really tasty but didn t come with veg so it was disappointing that we weren t told of this when ordering as we would have ordered a side of veg if we d known  Three of us  the ladies  had dessert which for me was a very delicious sticky toffee pudding  Again they were generous  There s nothing worse than running out of toffee sauce and or ice cream when you still have pudding left but this was the opposite  I was scooping up sauce with my little finger after I d finished  it was so moreish  I think more of us would have had dessert though if there had been more choice   As for the service and atmosphere it was just up my street  We sat in a very pleasant room  cosy but not cramped  exposed brick and wood  fireplaces  comfy chairs  nice bar  not too noisy  just very comfortable and relaxed  The serving staff didn t get grumpy with us for taking forever to order  they were happy to bring my sons meal out with starters  which was really helpful    asked us about drinks  checked we were happy etc  But they were reserved  not pushy or over friendly which suits me   I could only not give it  stars because I think I would have liked more choice  even though I know it was a lunch menu  and because I feel they should have asked us about the veg with the sausages and mash  I would definitely return  probably in the evening next time  I m thrilled that they source locally  
positive; We went for a family birthday meal  The service was excellent and has a good atmosphere slightly disappointed that the food wasn t as spicy as the dishes would expect  ie:vindaloo  Still had a wonderful time with the family  
positive; Lovely meal  good service  welcoming atmosphere  Definitely returning in the New Year  Plentiful portions  varied menu and not expensive  We were a large party of  and the meals arrived together  
positive;The open fires make it nice to sit down and have a relaxing drink  Friendly people and staff
positive;Our waitress Nicki  was superb  Great customer service skills in finding us a table that suited dining with an energetic toddler and helped provide entertainment for him and an extra milkshake when I knocked it over  Very polite and cheerful too   Food was tasty and there was plenty of it provided  There was a small delay in waiting to order but when the waitresses are making drinks like the milkshakes and serving this is understandable  Not the cheapest of  quot fast food quot  restaurants in Rugby but the taste of the burgers made up for this 
positive; Firstly we were a bit nervous too go too Blue following some of the recent reviews as we haven t been since the change from   We needn t have worried  We had a Travelzoo deal for two starters  two mains and glass of fizzy wine each and this was great value    We were welcomed at the bar and served drinks very quickly  before being told our table was ready  minutes earlier than our pm booking  we were not expecting to be seated as we had arrived early and were prepared too wait  but it was great they were able too seat us straight away   Food was served quick and was very tasty and it was great to see locally sourced meat on the menu  including the delicious lamb which i had  The waiter we had was great and very friendly  one set of forgotten drinks but this was soon rectified and apologies given   Blue is a lovely bistro and an asset to Coventry  for some reason the city does not manage too sustain or attract that many independent restaurants and i hope that Blue continues  and i hope that people that would usually go out into Warwickshire will give this city centre gem a chance   after all its also in one of the best historic buildings the city has too offer    Only suggestion  please brig back the Cherry beer  
positive; food was quick to come and cooked the way i requested  staff were helpful food was lovely will definitley go back again overall a good service b 
positive; we went here for my daughters birthday  the table was booked for   because of our grandchildren but it was   before our table  for   was ready  At   we were asked to leave because they needed the table  We had still got drinks so were not best pleased  They knew it was a birthday celebration   They shouldn t take the bookings if they can t cope   That said  the food is good and all you can eat  just don t expect to make a night of it at this restaurant  
positive; Five of us went to the Crown  four of us hadn t been for many years  The food was imaginative and delicious   the fish and crab were beautifully presented  loved the viola flowers in the salad   and staff happy to alter the menu slightly to suit individual tastes  Puddings  My Summer Pudding Terrine was pretty to look at and very tasty  Plenty of parking space too  
positive; The food was delicious and because we selected the tapas from the menu and wanted to try so many dishes   we did struggle to fit them all on the table  Lovely for large groups if the upper floor is reserved  or a romantic night out for   
positive; Myself and family visited here at weekend and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good Chinese restaurant in Blackpool  Buffet style restaurant with a large selection of lovely food  Staff were very attentive and constantly topping up dishes at the buffet hot plates  Child friendly and prices reasonable  My  year old was charged half of an adult price and my  year old ate for free  Would definitely go back  
positive;Got to Bournemouth for our mini break  and wanted a decent breakfast  so we done the english thing  and looked for a Wetherspoons   Came across the Mary Shelley and went straight in  Found a table  was very busy for  am    my partner went up and ordered our food and drinks  the poor girl on the bar had lost her voice  but was still serving everybody and being helpful   Our food came out quickly  no complaints whatsoever  as always  good food  good price and you know what you re getting   
positive; I was told when booking as it was Mothers day that we had to be out within two hours  As it turned out there was no pressure to leave as it was down to as and when we were served  The food was yummy  I had the spare ribs to start followed by the duck salad  The roast dinners looked amazing and tasted as good as my son had it and left nothing  The atmosphere was pleasant but we were in the conservatory alone  but once it filled up it was quite noisy  All six of us enjoyed the food best of all  and like the level of noise least of all  But this is one of our favourite resturants and we will be back in the not too distant future  
positive;We visited The Castle on a Sunday evening  It was the third pub we went in and by far the busiest pub  The Manager was so welcoming and funny  He made us feel welcome and nothing was to much trouble he let us try all the cask ales before we selected the Abbeydale Moonshine  We ordered food and was informed there was a  minute delay  but the food was on the table within  minutes  For   we got two good sized portions of fish and chips with mushy peas  great value and well presented 
positive; We visited whilst on holiday with our two young children months  the waitress was welcoming and friendly  restaurant was clean and tidy  The wait for food   pm  was around mins which was fine  they even have a small play area which our yr old used whilst we were waiting  The food is cheap general pub food  it s nothing posh or fancy but you should know that before you visit  it was exactly what we were looking for with two young children in tow  Our bill was   for the  of us including drinks which is very very reasonable in my opinion  Would definitely visit again  
positive; We had tea for  with a chocolate and hazelnut scone between us  The scone was rich and filling and plenty for the  of us to share  It was a little dry but came with a dish of nutella spread which made it even more chocolaty  Certainly a very interesting scone and definitely worth a try  The accompanying tea was good as was the service and setting  I would recommend the Muse to anyone wishing to have a light meal or afternoon tea slightly away from the bustle of the main High Street   PS  there were a number of dishes specifically for vegans and vegetarians  
positive; Inexpensive home cooking  Nothing very exotic  Generous portions for hearty appetites  Very reasonable prices  Warm and friendly  
positive; Hoylake Lights is a Wetherspoons pub and always a friendly welcome  Pub food as you would expect  Great atmosphere  Worth a visit if you are in the area  
positive; Went in on a Tuesday night   Paella night  What we received was definitely worth it for the money  A huge bowl  and a nice friendly atmosphere  Although the restaurant chairs weren t as comfortable as some   but this is because I have a lower back problem  They did provide me with cushions to help Staff were really friendly  and I would probably go back to try a different evening to see what other great offers ranges of food they do on other days of the week    Paella Tuesday   definitely worth it for the money  
positive; Vegetables were perfectly cooked  food was nice ad service was great  The interior was something special  with an authentic pub feel Will be revisiting soon 
positive; We just had wicked tuna steak dinner at this restaurant  sitting outside  Agnes  our server was very good with impressive knowledge of the menu and gave us good recommendation how to cook out steaks  They also had a bottle of lovely Chablis available which doesn t happen in many places  Thank you very much  
positive;I dined at La Parrilla this week for a friends st birthday celebration  it was a Tuesday night and absolutely packed out  the atmosphere was great and everyone had a good time  Our table was for  plus a pram and staff were very helpful and didn t miss a trick considering we had such a large table and the restaurant was so busy  Portions were huge  my boyfriend and I split the nachos with beef starter and ordered it extra hot  which we were pleased was an option on the menu to suite our taste  the main meals were huge and we both couldn t finish  although we tried very hard as it was delicious  Starter was about   and Main about    I ordered the Steak Burrito and My boyfriend the Chilli with edible bowl  both I would recommend  After we finished they dimmed the lights and all the staff came out singing Happy birthday with a cake and sparkler for our friend  all wearing ponchos  mustaches and sombreros and bringing enough sombreros out for our whole table for us to wear which was the highlight of out visit  Only thing to note is if your a tourist staying in the city centre  this restaurant is about a  minute taxi away in Crosby  if your plan is to go here i would recommend visiting Crosby beach marina too and making a night of it 
positive; Went with a group of friends so food took quite a while to come out  When it did it was lovely  really tasty  The music was too loud so you couldn t really have a conversation just shout to one another so that wasn t great and the table we were given bended round so was quite strange  I d go back but quite expensive so not that often 
positive; As a vegetarian who s gluten intolerant  the baked potato is my staple fallback when out eating  My husband and I were out at Washington Galleries and passed Penshaw Tearooms on the way home  we ve been before so know it s a clean  bright and welcoming place  On this occasion we ordered two baked potatoes  which were on our table in only a few minutes  lovely and soft and with a good amount of filling  It was very busy when we visited and its not always obvious whether one should choose a table first then order or vice versa  that aside  we had a great visit and will certainly be back in the future  
positive; Food and service as lovely as ever  All the tastier with % off on Mondays and Tuesdays    favourite local restaurant  Come back again and again  Only criticism is that drinks prices can be a little steep :  
positive; As a party of six we visited West Coast cafe on Saturday th March  for a family birthday gathering  We paid circa    for five adult and one childrens main meals  and eight drinks which in our opinion offered really good value for money   All of the meals were well cooked and nicely presented especially the King Kong and Big pig burgers which were absolutely huge  the childrens meal concisted of pizza  beans and a burger which could quite easily have been sold as an adult meal   The only negative part of our visit which the restaurant can t really be held accountable for was the disruption caused by the table adjacent to ours who were obviously drunk when they arrived even though it was only  pm  This meant that we were unable to talk to each other and resulted in us leaving early rather than reviewing the dessert options  
positive;This is a nice restaurant to eat in as they have tried to give the impression of private spaces despite there being a quite a lot of tables  The food is attractively presented  this can take a little longer when they are busy  but it is worth waiting for and makes for a pleasant evening out 
positive; Good food  really well cooked  Been here several times and the quality of the food is consistently good  Only possible criticism is that portions can sometimes be a bit on the large side but that saves money on a sweet  Good atmosphere and staff are friendly  
positive;Our experience dining here was excellent from start to finish  The waitress was lovely she recommended a great white wine for us  We never had to wait long for anything  but we didn t feel rushed either  The restaurants atmosphere was relaxed for such a busy restaurant  The food was perfect  it was a nice treat for the end of our holiday
positive;Booked a table here for : on Bonfire Night with my friend    Lovely  cosy  roaring warm fire was the entrance and our table was all ready for us    There were specials to choose from as well as the main menu    My friend and I both chose a fish starter  my fish   chips were huge and had to leave a bit much to my dismay    I chose apple   rhubarb crumble with custard for dessert which was absolutely delicious    What a lovely place  
positive; We were desperate for a meal and found this strange named restaurant We had trouble finding the car park and then difficulty opening the front door but once inside magic  It resembled an ancient version of a real pub  The hospitality was enchanting  The food was a little expensive but good value  An excellent choice for a stop  
positive; I had a recently diner with a family I was speechless about the food  proper Italian  very tasty  Amazed about the service the hall package I was very impressed about the manager Nicola  the way he control the situation even the restaurant was packed  Thank you  will be back soon  
positive;great value pub grub as always in centre of town  Families welcome
positive; I visited today and enjoyed the lunch we had   The soup starter was very nice  the carvery meal was ok but the pavlova dessert was amazing   Friendly service and lovely hotel   The main menu looks really good so I will definitely be going back to sample more of the food  
positive;We ve eaten there once and the food was good the atmosphere was good and so was the service 
positive; I had been told bad things about here but was very pleasantly surprised  I went on a blind date and the food was lovely  the staff were all very attentive and over all I had a lovely evening  
positive; Called here for a bite to eat sat outside because we had our dog We had tuna mayo sandwiches and a bowl of chips very nice and well presented my only gripe is that the outside tables needed clearing will visit again if in the area  
positive;Very friendly staff have eaten here many times with famil and friends in the winter wrap up it can get cole  Takeway very good but expensive 
positive; Don t be put off by the exterior  This place is fantastic  Expect great food  good service and sensible prices  Great for kids too  Go and try it  
positive;We stayed here for four nights in September  It s a lovely place  an  authentic  Cotswolds pub  and our room was also very nice  The bathroom was one of the best we ve experienced  an excellent size with a heated towel rail and powerful shower    Breakfast was lovely  with fruit and yoghurt to start followed by a range of cooked options  I m coeliac and they were happy to provide gluten free bread for me  we notified them in advance  which was much appreciated  The staff were very friendly but the service was quite slow some mornings   We also had dinner here on our first night  Before arriving they d sent us a menu listing which dishes were gluten free or could be adapted to be so  which had a good selection  so I asked for the grilled fish and chips  However the waitress then informed me that the chips are cooked in oil which is also used for items containing gluten  and asked if I d be ok with this  I m always very cautious with the risk of cross contamination and I feel this should have been made clearer when we originally asked which dishes would be suitable  Instead I went for the mushroom  spinach and sun dried tomato risotto  which was absolutely delicious   Would definitely stay here again 
positive; I was on a coach trip from South Wales and we ended up at Cheltenham then the steam railway  finishing the day with a carvery meal at the Kings Arms  They coped very well with a bus load of people and the meal was piping hot and plenty to choose from  The sweets were a bit slow in coming but all in all thoroughly enjoyed our meal  
positive;Service is perfect  Food is average but generous portions  Nice atmosphere  I had my car vandalised whilst having my meal and although it s not their fault I did feel like the staff weren t being very helpful
positive; Three of us went to the Farm CafÇ¸ for Sunday Lunch we were welcomed to our booked table by pleasant member of staff and given the Menu Two of us had the beautifully cooked roast beef with Fresh vegetables my husband opted for the home made Quiche with new potatoes and fresh salad we all cleared our plates and then I enjoyed one of my favourites Treacle Tart   Custard the other s enjoying cheesecake and Sticky toffee pudding with cream  After a rest we enjoyed a Lovely hot pot of English Tea  this is a friendly place were families are welcome the atmosphere is just right and the staff are delightful and helpful even when they are very busy  This was my first visit but I shall be back with friends  On the way out we stopped in the Farm Shop and purchased some of there own produced Sausages and pies which we shall enjoy  We all enjoyed watching the children have the opportunity to see the animals by the car park altogether a lovely day out in a beautiful country setting 
positive;Enjoyed a great lunch at Handmade Burger in the Bullring in Birmingham  I had the burger with blue cheese  bacon and mushroom  and my son opted for the macho barbecue beef  cheese and bacon  We both had a portion of fries but one portion between the two of us would have been sufficient as you do get a lot  The food was delicious and the service helpful and efficient  Would definitely go again and recommend to others 
positive; have been here a few times and this time i had the most delicious chicken with chorizo sauce and roasted new potatoes and a salad   a tad expensive but lovely  Willl be visiting again   
positive; Never had a bad dinner in Gino s  We took our  year old son for an end of term   good report treat   The food is always really delicious and very generous in portion size  The only down side to this place is how tight the tables are packed    it did occur to me that there wasn t even an average size sideways thigh width between the tables so if you were in the middle row ans needed the little girls room half way through you could knock the neighboring table quite easily which would be awkward   The staff were attentive without being in your face  There was no added service charge which I ve seen other people comment on  We had  starters  brushcetta which was beautiful as always and big enough to let the other half share a little bit   an Italian take on prawn cocktail which was huge and to quote my son  Really really good  quot  The size of what would be a main in some places This was followed by Gorgonzola risotto packed with bacon chicken mushrooms garlic and shallots    creamy and lovely but not for the health conscious  and  Pollo alla crema s which were beautiful  with salad and chips  Our son had pudding too which was ice cream amaretto biscuits and amaretto    and he only managed this because he has a huge appetite    This was all washed down with a bottle of wine and  cokes for    All  of us came away feeling very full and pleased with dinner   If you want to go for a quiet romantic evening then this isn t the place  fast turn over noisy and cramped but very good food and efficient service   and   for a bottle of house white which was nice in a restaurant is a very reasonable bonus   Would recommend  
positive; Had a great lunch with my family   and  yrs  today  excellent seafood  oysters to die for   Will definitely visit again  
positive;Visited on a Friday night and the atmosphere was really good  the set up of the tables meant it didn t feel to crowded  The staff were friendly and welcoming particularly my waiter Danny R   Some indication of whether to seat yourself or wait to be seated would be good as I saw a lot of people hesitate at the top of the steps and look confused  Drink   Fresh Lemonade   proper sweet and bitter Starter   Bruschetta   lovely and fresh Main   Asparagus Risotto   nice but lacking in creaminess and depth of flavour Dessert   Chocolate Torte   too die for lovely and rich with raspberry colis though some nice vanilla ice cream would be good
positive; Absolutely superb veggie Indian restaurant near the Neasden temple with good parking too and one of the best Indian supermarkets in London on the same site  Immaculately clean decor and great service  one of the best tarka dals ever and I loved the tangy Punjabi Samosa Chaat and Kachories   pea fritters and Gobi paratha 
positive; We visited her last Saturday with my husband  son and his friend  both are   Its busy and buzzy and provide great activity menu sheets for the children  High chairs for the little one  we took our  month old too   Kids menu is short and sweet  Burger  chicken burger or macaroni cheese  Simple  Burgers were cooked to perfection  Kids meals came with cucumber and carrot batons for balance and they cleared their plates  Lovely flavour and really good value for money  Desserts for the children was chocolate brownie with cream  Again  plates cleared  Staff were friendly and helpful  Felt under no pressure when the little one started dropping food on the floor  Really good all round restaurant  Will definitely come again and recommend  
positive; If they could just speed up the service at busy times  they would be even better  good value for money especially on the    menu 
positive; Came here for the first time on Sunday evening and it was really quiet  only a few groups were there  Service was fast and we were served by the same lady all night who was friendly and attentive  The decorations around the restaurant added a great atmosphere to the place  For starters we had  the halloumi skewer  BBQ pulled pork   cheese toastadas  peri peri prawns and the chicken  chorizo   sweetcorn medley quesadilla bites   these were all lovely  For the mains  two of us had the vegetarian  bean chilli chimichanga which we both enjoyed  and then the two others had the BBQ chicken fajita  they mentioned that this could have done with another couple of wraps to put the filling in   it s a DIY deal and there was two much filling for the  wraps  and the texan rib eye steak  they mentioned that this was a bit plain and dry and could have done with some kind of sauce over it   used the habanero sauce thatr is provided on every table which isn t actually that spicy   Finally  for dessert I would highly recommend the mexican mess which was delicious and had a bit of everything inside   one full sized churro  small pieces of churros  brownies bits  raspberry ripple icecream  strawberries and cream  My friends then had the churros and hot chocolate and two had the toffee popcorn brownies which looked amazing  Was a bit unsure of whether or not i would like it here as i m not keen on spicy food but it really wasn t spicy at all which i was happy about but my boyfriend was a little disappointed about  was a little on the expensive side   came to   and that was with % off with a cineworld card so would only go with the discount  
positive; Went to Prezzo in Lewes last night for a girls catch up  Food was good as usual  Prices and service are always good too  Often you can get discount codes online too  which is always a bonus  I recommend booking if you choose to go on a busy weekend evening  
positive;Wont ruin the magic but excellent experience if you re looking for a bar that offers something different  Wouldn t rave about the food but the cocktails were great    and original  
positive;Fantastic service and exceptional food   Had so many different choices and was well worth the trip out to get there 
positive; Being a Bank Holiday we expected it to be busy and it was  We booked a table for   pm and and were pleased to find it ready for us  The sevice was good and the staff very friendly and helpful  We waited a little time for our food but this was to be expected as we did not order starters  The food was delicious when it arrived  well cooked and presented  The Full Moon is a bustling but cosy pub with a lovely atmosphere  The only thing we found a little annoying was the volume of noise coming from a large group of cyclists who had all arrived at the same time  
positive; Popped in for brunch on a Saturday morning  Staff friendly  food excellent and reasonably priced for the quality  Eggs benedict was perfect and husband loved his steak  The only reason this doesn t get  stars is because the service was a little slow and we waited quite a while to place our order and then well over  minutes for our food even though the restaurant was pretty much empty  This wouldn t put me off returning though   we ll definitely be back and look forward to trying an evening meal here  
positive; We live in the village and decided to pop down on Tuesday evening to see what the food offering was like  as we hadn t visited since the new owners took over a couple of months ago  I will say now that the Artichoke was one of our favourite pubs in the area under the old landlords  so it was with some trepidation that we visited this week  I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised   the new owners are very friendly and welcoming and the food on offer was very similar to before  thank goodness Yes the portions are slightly smaller now  but I would say that they are much more  normal  in size now and I finally managed to enjoy a pudding   I could never fit in a pudding before   The wine was good as always and thank goodness Asahi beer is still on offer for my other half  I do have a few moans  wouldn t be British if I didn t    Firstly  where are the hops This is a Kent pub and linked to the local brewery and hops should be an absolute essential  It seemed very empty without them in the pub  I was also surprised that only one fire was lit   we sat in the restaurant to eat and it was quite chilly in there  Even if no one is booked in to the restaurant  the fire should be lit to make it warm and welcoming  Finally  although I liked the new sleek look to the back of the bar  as it s black  it s quite dark and would look lovely with some fairy lights to brighten up the back of the bar  Overall I was really impressed with what I saw and ate in the pub and the food allergen advice in the menu was a great touch  With a couple of minor tweaks I would definitely be giving it  stars next time   
positive; From a lover of Hakkasan  Wagamamma and Yauatcha  the duck and rice for me was a really good find  It is an affordable  cooler  less expensive version of the above  Rather than feeling stiff in your suit or in your bodycon dress  this has a much more relaxed and casual vibe  It is a converted pub so already quite chilled  very cool interior and a good playlist   The bar downstairs is fun and lively  Bar tenders could be a bit friendlier  We went to our table in the restaurant upstairs  the spiral staircase is the coolest thing and great for pictures   and it was right by the fire so nice and cosy   We ordered Sangria  a sharing cocktail which went down extremely well  We also had edamame   I tend to judge restaurants on their edamame and poppadoms  and these were good   We also had scallop shumai and prawn dumplings which were very good   We obviously ordered the duck as the clue is in the name  which was so crispy and just stunning  it came with pancakes and the usual trimmings   We then had  we ate so much crispy chilli beef  which was OK  too orangey for my liking   I had steamed aubergine which was by far the best aubergine I ve ever had    So juicy and flavoursome    Bill was approx   for two which I guess is quite expensive but I do think it was worth it and I would return    
positive; My family of five were booked in for lunch  Through out our stay we had friendly efficient service  The welcome was warm and there was no question that this is a well run ship   We had the four courses for   menu  You can chose from a great selection of savouries and two desserts in any combination  All delicious  The bread was warm and replenished and not whisked away to soon which I personally find very irritating  The whole experience was very good  
positive; Nice pub  with a great view of massive ferries passing incredibly close to you  
positive; We enjoyed a late lunch at the Vanilla Pod at the end of a long walk along the coastal path  We had roasted red pepper and tomato soup + bread and butter  It was delicious  The menu looked good for evening meals though we didn t have the opportunity to go back  Friendly service  
positive; Met a friend here for lunch  Ordered the afternoon tea and was able to swap a couple of sandwich fillings which was Fab  Ordered my  year old niece a child s afternoon tea for    and it was huge   I d have been happy to have that one  It s a great idea to do a child s afternoon tea to let the kiddies feel like they re part of the adult group  There was toy boxes for her to play with whilst we waited for food  Only thing I d have liked would have been a stainless steel teapot of hot water to top up the tea while we make our way through the food we had  Tables are a little crammed together and I felt a little  stuck in  once it became busy  but the Staff were lovely and made the visit enjoyable for my niece  Lovely place if you have small children to meet with friends for afternoon tea  They had an entrance from the back which was great for my friend with a pram and newborn  saving her from manoevering her pram up the steps and around the tables  Of course  we spent more in the little treat shop on the way out with their massive choice of traditional sweets and muffins  
positive; Food and choice very good  Had to order vegetables separately which was a bit of a nuisance and got persuaded to try sweet potato chips  which were lovely but didn t really go with the fish I ordered    Otherwise our service was very good but did notice a family in front of us getting pretty poor service when the very awkward front of house person couldn t find their booking and asked for the same information  times   Would have given excellent but for the music  Female singer covering lots of styles of music and  quot murdering quot  each song  Hard to stomach if you are a musician  Breakfast brilliant  
positive;I often visit here  as its like  doors away from my house   I cant fault the food at all   the chicken chat is to die for    Although the only thing that annoys me is the wait time   I have eaten in once   it was so quiet yet waited around  mins for my food  I often have takeaways from here   to be told on the phone always   mins  got to collect it  then still having to wait around  mins when I arrive  the restaurant isn t bust either when I go so I have no idea what the wait time is all about 
positive; Really good  attentive service here  with equally good food and great milkshakes  Highly recommended  
positive; We ve just returned from a lovely evening at Tamburinos  It was nice not having to travel into Yeovil  The scallops were cooked to perfection along with my husbands king prawns  I chose the rack of lamb which was gorgeous but had too many onions with the sauce  My husband had veal which was well cooked  full of flavour and not overpowered by the sauce  The beverages were good and were served well  Service was attentive but not intrusive  Would definitely go again  
positive; A good clean pub  bright clean modern decor  Comfortable seating  big garden  Food exceptionally good value pizzas and burgers all home made  Open kitchen  But best of all local beer on tap  Harveys  etc  Big screen t v  for sport in one bar and large functions room  
positive; After many times visiting The Royal Standard I realized a review was in order   This Pub   the oldest free house in the country   is consistently great on every visit  Full of nooks   cranies around to explore   take a walk around please   Excellent beer   cider selections  the menu is much above average pub fare and the ambience is happy   casual and very relaxed  Dogs are always welcome   much to our delight  :  My favorite is the mussels pot cooked in wine  But there is plenty for all tastes  This is one of our usual Sunday Lunch spots when in UK  
positive; We went at Sunday lunchtime for my husbands th birthday with a family group of  ages ranging years  We received a warm welcome from the waitress who gave us a choice of tables  All the staff were friendly and helpful  We were able to take balloons and our own cake  Our waiter presented the cake  complete with lit candles and music with a grand flourish  We all had the buffet which you could visit as many times as you liked  Excellent value  This was not our first visit and will definitely not be our last  
positive; Tasty take away  if not on the small side of a portion  Biriyani sauce was a   of the container and was shy of being enough  but it was really well flavoured  and the saag wasn t greasy  We chose to collect and it was ready really quickly  
positive; Came here because it was my dads birthday  The food choice isn t huge but it is varied  Food came in a reasonable time to say it was a Saturday night and the place was full  Lovely presentation and tasted great   Only down fall to the evening was waiting for our second lot of drinks happened to be a longer wait than normal  When we asked the waitress were they where she came straight over with them  You could tell they were busy and trying there hardest but this was the only down side to the evening  Like stated above food was lovely  piping hot and a reasonable wait time  Also the chips are lovely and homemade  I will return here  
positive; Visited for a quick breakfast with my fussy father and  year old  Very reasonably priced and food cooked well with small extras  side salad with bacon cob   Usually pay more in a garden centre cafÇ¸  where you have to queue to order yourself  The waitress service was a nice addition to our visit and the staff were all very friendly and helpful  With the location being near the water it made for a very relaxing morning  
positive; We love the Boot Room and visit regularly  It never disappoints  Order with confidence  everything is excellent  but save room for pudding  The souffle is not to be missed  Absolutely extraordinary  
positive; All you can eat cooked and continental breakfast for  might sound a bit steep but    kids eat free  so it balances it out a bit    My husband and I took our  year old and  month old on a Sunday morning  not something we normally do  it was in lieu of an anniversary dinner which is virtually impossible to do with the children    We were seated and two high chairs were provided  there was a good selection of  cereals or more  fresh fruit  yogurts  three different milks  Costa coffee machine  Twinings tea and fresh juices and water  nicely cooked breakfast of sausages  bacon  hash browns  beans  tomatoes  mushrooms  black pudding  scrambled and fried eggs  Also available were wholemeal and white bread for toasting  crumpets  pancakes  pastries  mini muffins and a selection of jams  syrup  Nutella etc    There is a soft play area within the restaurant  it s good but they charge you an extra   to play which seems a bit mean  It was nice and clean though and well staffed  there was a small toddler area and a decent sized larger play maze obstacle course  There were tables in the same area  if we had known we would have eaten in there and been able to relax a little more as our  year old could have played once he had finished his breakfast    The whole restaurant was clean  as were the baby changing facilities and toilets    We will definitely go to this establishment again  
positive;    First time we went was in June  My boyfriend had some sort of Oreo drink whereas I had the mango green tea with mango popping pearls and we both loved our choices  Second time he had the same drink again but I chose the taro milk tea with lychee jelly  I liked this one a lot although I still prefer the mango green tea ever so slightly   Only complaint: the jelly doesn t travel up the straw as easily as the popping pearls do  resulting in too much leftover jelly once you ve finished the drink   Good variety of flavours and toppings  plus you can choose how much ice and sugar to have in your drink   
positive; Visited the cafe during a quieter time  so we were able to sit downstairs  Our Coffee and cake were both lovely  however I couldn t help but notice the way the waitresses treated the customers was appalling   I have worked in the hospitality industry for years so I understand that it can be hard to keep cheerful when its very hot   busy  but snapping at customers and scowling whilst waiting on tables is really not acceptable  
positive; As I was staying in the complex and it was so very cold I didn t want to stray too far so chanced upon Kublai and was pleasantly surprised  With a central barbecue pit the aormas were enticing and I had the chicken special  skewered and cooked in a clay pit  really fresh  original Pakistani cuisine  It was very good  Accompaniments were simple and also excellent and staff polite and welcoming  Nice Shiraz to keep out the March chill  all round a good experience  
positive;Excellent food all round  slightly let down with a less than professional service and attention to detail 
positive; My partner and I went to the harbour garden cafe restaurant last Friday  We had a superb  course meal including a half lobster  The service was discreet yet efficient  The food was fabulous  the restaurant itself is great  a little quirky as it s all  all fresco  Despite being a little chilly there are blankets provided  and patio heaters  can t wait to go back when it s warmer  
positive;It is good  it is fun  it is efficient and friendly  What else do you wish if  like me and my friends  you have regular early dinners before attending the marvellous Ashmolean Proms concerts in Oxford 
positive; We came here for a meal for two and this place didn t disappoint  We had lobster and steak  both were generous portions and cooked well  the Lobster was succulent and fresh and so large I couldn t even finish it  The sauces were fantastic too  The wine was lovely and the service was very good  We were served quickly and all was as we expected  if not better   Price was competitive and reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food    The only thing to add was there were a lot of families but this could ve been down to the time we ate   pm   Romantic diners may want to come a bit later to avoid  
positive; Went here before the movies  Service was really good  The food comes quite fast  The pizza was very good  Cozy and friendly atmosphere  
positive; My boyfriend and I came here for our first date and everything was absolutely amazing  The food was lovely  the staff were friendly and welcoming and they really looked after us all night  I d definitely recommend this restaurant  
positive; lovely setting and decor and nice choice of food but would pick it for a simple lunch with friends rather than with my hubby  
positive; We came here to celebrate my mums birthday on Easter Sunday   I booked the table several weeks before we were due to come so was a little disappointed when I received a call the day before we were due to go to ask if we could change our time from  pm to midday    A polite gentleman explained that they have  people booked in and if I want to receive a good service and not be rushed would we mind coming in at the earlier time  I reluctantly said we would do this but I wasn t impressed  If i wanted to book a table for midday then obviously I would have done  In my opinion  if a restaurant holds a certain number of diners then surely they should be able to accommodate this  It would have gone a long way if they would have offered us a bottle of wine or the like as a gesture of goodwill for us agreeing to change our plans to suit them   I ordered asparagus to start  duck for main and brioche for dessert  I had high expectations for the food at Chez Vous and I felt a little disappointed with my starter and main   it was nice but I was expecting gorgeous flavours which it lacked  My dessert however  was fantastic   one of the best desserts i ve ever had    My family enjoyed their food more than I did   they had lamb and beef dishes which they said was lovely and my mum said her flavours were amazing   The waiters and waitresses served their purpose but I felt lacked personality and were simply doing their job  Considering we were the first table to arrive and for some time there were just three other occupied tables I thought it would have been nice of them to make more of an effort   for example: on the booking form it asks you if there is a reason why you are visiting so  I chose that we were visiting to celebrate a birthday  I have no idea why they want to know seeing as no one even asked who s birthday it was    If it were my restaurant I would put something small yet effective in place to acknowledge the event   I really wanted to love this restaurant as I live in Warlingham and as prices are above average I wanted my meal to reflect this   maybe next time  
positive; we visited here for a birthday dinner because we d heard it was the best place locally whilst we couldn t fault the food   wine we found it all very pretentious no wonder it s so expensive they have one person to greet you another to make small talk when we would have preferred to talk to each other  another to take the order another to carry it in on a salver another to describe the food to you as they present it to you  the staff seemed to outnumber the guests about  to  it became quite hilarious the constant stream of new faces to the table  they should stick to serving the excellent food without all the fuss 
positive; This is my mother s local and i have fond memories coming for a pint of cider in my teens with the last owners  I went the other day with my family and spent the afternoon inside on a rainy afternoon with the dog  playing cards  The new owners were very welcoming and the service was great  
positive; We visited here for a little snack the place is nice inside and you can also sit outside by the river which is lovely the cakes are nice I had a scone which was massive but tasty  Would recommend trying it  
positive; I have only been here the one time however the noodles were excellent  served quickly by a staff that were attentive and polite  I can recommend this place to anyone in a hurry wanting good priced convenient food  
positive; We love this takeaway  Great choice of food  Free prawn crackers and when we get the food home it s always really hot  Staff are very friendly  the only downside is they don t accept cards as payment so don t forget to take cash with you  
positive;Excellent dinner with friends  The food is well cooked and presented  also good value  There are always some specials on the board  This is also a a very good pub  so if you are walking in the area and need refreshment  this is for you  Outside gardens for sunny weather 
positive;We stopped here after a long  mile walk and the roaring log burning fire was such a HUGE welcome  The coffee and cake were enjoyed  The menu looked delicious and having looked around at people s plates they were clearly enjoying the food  Staff friendly  Not the cheapest of places  but very tasteful   worth paying that bit extra 
positive; We were invited back to the Didsbury Lounge after our last visit not being the best    The one thing I could not complain about on my last visit was the food  it was perfect  the food is current and exciting  We decided to try the tapas  or rather just smaller versions of the menu  This is one of my favourite ways of eating  a table full of food and everyone can tuck in and try a bit of everything   The only thing I have come to realise about Didsbury lounge  it is not some where you can go in a hurry  it is more somewhere to while an afternoon or evening away The staff were very attentive  maybe a little to much   We were returning after a poor visit the time before so I think they were pulling out all the stops  it would be nice to think you will have this service every time and I will definitely be visiting again soon to find out  
positive; if you are looking for a place to eat then i reccomend the george been there several times and i % recomend the sunday dinners   i get the veggie dinner and alway highly enjoy it  good portion especially love the gravy  cauliflower cheese   yorkshire puddings   nice atmosphere and great service  my number  place for sunday dinner  if you have never been get yourself there especially on a sunday  
positive; Thai food was just as good as  if not better than  any chain thai restaurant on the high street  I had the Chicken Penang curry and it was delicious  Great value for money and it s good that you don t have to eat your meal in the restaurant section of the pub  as we wanted to eat while watching sport All staff were very friendly and were efficient both in serving and clearing up afterwards   Would definitely go back and would highly recommend to others  
positive; This is a somewhat hidden cafe situated in the Lamb Arcade on the top floor  It is small but very comfortable with big sofas as well as the usual tables  I have only had coffee and lunch but always enjoyed it  Free newspapers make it a great place to visit on your own to relax and chill  
positive; Thoroughly enjoyed my experience here  The staff were friendly  attentive and polite  The food was exceptionally lovely  Will definitely be going again  
positive; My husband and I stayed overnight at the Travelodge next door and so had our breakfast in the Little Chef  Excellent breakfast and very good service from the staff  Very clean and efficient  
positive; Great lunch treat for my husband All the food delicious and service very good with explanations of the dishes We enjoyed walking round the veg  garden and seeing the pigs Only complaint was   service charge added to bill We would gladly have left a tip but don t like this practice of including it Also prices seem to have gone up quite a lot since our last visit as we had to order side dishes to go with the mains  
positive; We phoned ahead and picked up our order  food was extremely tasty and very fresh  one of the best Indian meals I have had for ages to be truthful  not sure on sit down meals as the other reviews are mixed but I don t see the food being different so maybe they had a bad day  
positive; Sunday lunch is busy  understandably  so service can be slow  However  couldn t complain at the food  The belly pork was lovely and I would definitely recommend  
positive; We had a storming and most fabulous night on Friday at Proud using Groupon vouchers which were   for  course dinner and show  The venue is wonderful and decadent  down the stairs lined with huge vintage mirror and candelabras into a basement decorated  s style with a clear view of the stage from most the tables in the restaurant  unlike some other venues where you can barely see the stage   It was incredibly busy  the place was completely full but the staff are fantastic at whizzing around the tables and checking you are enjoying your evening and are attended  Our waitresses were lovely and looked great too in their corsets and feathers  They recommended seriously yummy mandarin martinis and a great choice of red wine and the drinks kept flowing  The drinks are not cheap but then they never are in these type of places  The food was good  not spectacular but it was nice  served promptly too  The portions are on the small side though  We loved the show and the dancing with the DJ afterwards  this was the best part of the night and we were fortunate to have a table right next to the stage so could enjoy the action close up  The performers were fantastic including a gorgeous Elle Amour and a stunning Banbury Cross performing Marilyn Monroe inspired stripping to Diamonds are a girls best friend  amazing contortionists and a wonderful compere too who was incredibly funny   who at one point pulled me up on stage to dance  The performers were not sleazy but rather chic and saucy  We stayed late rocking and rolling and dancing away to fantastic soul and funk music after the show  My friend had a super special birthday and we had a ball  even her sparkly cake you provided went down a treat   this was extra but well worth it to see her face light up with joy    They do add a  % service charge which on top of the drinks does push up the bill but with the Groupon vouchers I thought this was worth it for such a different and wonderful night out  
positive; The location is very good and so is the ambience  The food also is tasty but I wouldn t say the best   as I ve had better roasts  The portion sizes were also small compared to some other good pubs and price wise also    I wouldn t say that I wouldn t go back or wouldn t recommend   it s nice   but it s just not my st choice  
positive; If you ve ever been to a Nandos before  this one isn t really much to say  There s nothing specific about this branch that stands out as noteworthy  but it serves the same tasty cheap food you can rely on  And it has bottomless soft drinks which are always a bonus  The staff are friendly and helpful and the service is quick  but doesn t leave you feeling rushed   I was surprised  however  to find the place so busy at : on a Tuesday evening  I was able to get a seat right away  but tables weren t staying free for long  It was also a little noisy so I found it difficult to hear when ordering my food  but that may be just me  If you re planning on going on a more traditionally busy night  it might be worth phoning ahead  
positive;Great menu  great food  we enjoyed a set meal for two  they changed one of the main courses to beef for us and that made my husbad very happy  We went with my sister and her husband and they are veggies  great menu for them also  it is their fav place to eat while in Bowness 
positive; As long term holiday makers who have had a holiday home on the island for nearly  years  we have become very discerning where we visit and eat  having used the red lion regularly in the past we are so pleased that the new owners have kept the charming garden and the the food is varied and extrememely good  the atmosphere is very welcoming and accommodating to everyone including dogs  so felt completely relaxed we cannot recommend highly enough although should keep it a wonderful secret shhhhh   
positive; Having heard a lot about this pub  we booked a table and enjoyed a lovely meal of traditional pub grub   It s not Michelin starred  nor does it profess to be  but what this pub offers is excellent value for money and traditional pub food  The menu is extensive and when we were there  plenty of families were eating also  with children of all ages  There is a lovely happy atmosphere and although it is really busy  the service was quick and the staff are friendly   The one vegetable I dislike is parsnips  however  this pub s battered parsnips are deeee licious  How can such a nasty tasting vegetable be transformed into something so delightful  You have got to try them to believe it   Highly recommended for a great meal out   the portion sizes are huge though  so you d better be hungry when you arrive  
positive; The Smugglers Cott was full character but we were rather tightly squeezed into a corner This was a general theme with space though out the  floors  Saying that the food was very good and well cooked Staff worked hard and remained pleasant and helpful  
positive; Visited here after seeing some friends before going home we decided to have a bite to eat at the Lintot  On arriving we were greeted at a quirky reception with a sign saying wait to be seated  since our last visit the atmosphere an arrangement had changed a lot  When greeted we were taken to an adequate table an given menus  these had downsized since our last visit but still had all the favourites on  we were also asked what we d like to drink  not realising its table service we ordered a drink which came within  mins  We then ordered food  including an item from the specials board  Presentation   portion size was average   enjoyable  When the table was being cleared dessert menus were brought over  who could say no when a fridge full of cake was in eyesight  Presentation of the desserts were lovely   All in all  a lovely end to a day with my friends  Not visited The Lintot since a bad experience in Aug  but will defiantly be visiting again soon  Keep it up   
positive;Called for lunch this week and was well impressed The pub is cosy and has a lovely atmosphere which is better than some modern pubs The lady who took my food order was very helpful and we didn t wait to long even though they were busy They have a lunch time menu which is really reasonable and a good selection of beers which my husband did comment on We will be coming again maybe on the steak night  
positive; Really nice food  reasonable prices for a good meal out  Staff were very friendly and attentive  The only thing that lets it down is the mens toilets  which are horrid   but we were assured that these are being rectified  
positive; I visited the White Horse about a month ago not realising it had been completley re vamped  We did not stay to eat at that time as we had not booked and there was an hour s wait  However  we decided to return for my partner s birthday  This time we booked a table and there were  of us  We were up in the gallery which was nice  The new decor is great  although much bigger they have not lost that village pub atmosphere  The staff were very pleasant but we were told on arrival that we would have to order at the bar as it was Sunday evening  It did mean me and others having to go down to bar at regular intervals for drinks and to order food which I thought was a bit of a shame    However  the food was very good  I had the duck in orange sauce which was delicious  The drinks we had were good although there was limited choice of wine as they were expecting a delivery   We had ordered one coffee to come with the desserts and had to ask for this three times before it arrived   I would come again as I like the atmosphere  food and staff but the service needs to be a bit better if they want an excellent mark  
positive;Went here for a couple of drinks with around  work colleagues  It is a small quaint pub with a large selection of drinks to chose from  Great atmosphere  and outside area that is heated for those that want to be outside  Only  person serving and he did a brilliant job considering there were so many of us that he probably wasn t expecting on a Tuesday night after pm 
positive;Popped in here with friends last week and had breakfast   is really cosy and clean however we did think it was a bit pricey for simple food  Nice enough and tasted good though
positive; Wandered along the river to this beautiful new pub for an early supper with my daughter and a friend  What a fantastic transformation from the old Dolphin  The decor is absolutely stunning and the outdoor area is really lovely   The food was very good  we had a couple of dishes from the sharing menu  My daughter really enjoyed her hotdog and ate every last scrap  which is a very rare occurrence  Pudding was really great too  Not sure the Sangria we shared was quite up our street but you can t win them all    Overall  service at the bar was a little on the slow side  to be expected with a new opening  but the staff were all friendly and working very hard and the food was worth it  So glad there is finally a family friendly pub within walking distance from home  We will definitely return  
positive; Owing to a truly awful Christmas Eve  meal  under temporary management  I was sent a gift card by way of an apology   Kieran and Nick are back at the Wheatsheaf and the all round standard of the pub has been raised by their hard work   We were met with a huge grin  I have missed that  and a warm welcome  Our drinks appeared like magic and the food was lovely    The pub has regained its heart  
positive; This restaurant knows how to look after its customers without breaking the bank  The food was presented well and served in a timely manner  Especailly recommed the King Prawn curry  After looking into the windows of other Indian restaurants during the day  I would say we got this just about right  We went at pm with our two young children   and   and it was perfect for us  Go on  do it  you won t be disappointed  
positive; Went to the Greystoke to catch up with friends  as it is really convenient for the tube for all of us   We had a really nice evening  with good service from barman Daniel  and very nice food  We will definitely be visiting again  
positive;I have always liked this place and can t understand the negative reviews  definitely not my experience  
positive; We were craving Chinese and we passed this buffet and called in  Food choice was massive hot and cold from sushi to dim sum to soup to proper Chinese main meals and then the puddings omg the chocolate fountain and ice cream machine   Yesss 
positive; I only used the Bakers Arms for breakfast having stayed the previous night at the Premier Inn next door  the service and food was excellent with attentive staff and prompt service  they were constantly clearing tables and replenishing the buffet always with a smile   Shame some of this positive attitude does not rub off onto some of the breakfast staff at the Stanborough Premier Inn based in Welwyn Garden City  
positive; We went for a romantic fine dining meal in January  I had pre booked a table and looked at the menu online beforehand  The decor is lovely  menu is good but I find the restaurant a bit out of place in a town the size of Rugby  It is a fine dining restaurant but it doesn t quite pull it off for the prices they are charging   The staff is helpful but they seem to be rushed  even when it s not that busy  and a bit under trained   The shot glass of soup is a nice touch and so is a plate of bread  I might go back if the menu changes or when I read at least  excellent reviews   Overall: food is nice but not the best  staff needs training  nice decor  value for money no unfortunately 
positive; Visited today with my inlaws and eldest child  Shop very small but lovely selection of choccies not too pricey  Tea room very quaint my son loved reading the history boards upstairs   We had  different flavour hot chocolates mine was cherry flavoured delicious  My son and i shared an amazing choc gateaux   Only quibble was the state of the menus but crumpled and old looking could do with an update  
positive; We ve eaten at the Treehouse a fair few times now and its up there in our top  places to eat as we know we ll be guaranteed great food  The setting of the whole place is excellent and the imposing fire that greets you on entry is guaranteed to make the atmosphere cosy for the rest of your evening as do all the lovely twinkle lights everywhere   The menu doesn t seem to change often but the options that are available will suit many different appetites and tastes  It has never disappointed us however we would love to see some different puddings on offer  a traditional chocolate cake will never disappoint anyone  The staff are friendly and quite attentive  sometimes they have looked a little bit too tarted up with make up  which they don t need as they re all very pretty  with their hair tied up in funny styles which doesn t seem to be in keeping with the sophistication of the restaurant   Booking is a must with the Treehouse especially around Christmas as we ve had to change our plans at times due to not getting the evening we first wanted but that wasn t a problem   All in all a magical place to eat  food is always lovely and we would definately recommend it  
positive; Good choice of vine  Tasty and nicely served food  Very tasty dessert  Helpful  competent and friendly staff member Ola  We waited shortly despite the fact there was a lot people and restaurant looked busy   
positive;After a disappointing visit to the Nags Head just after it opened  we returned this evening when looking for quick meal for two  Delighted with the improvements   excellent  attentive service  good food in a peaceful  calm atmosphere  We will definitely return 
positive; Visited here last week  It was very busy  but service and food were great  Football was being shown and we had a lovely meal  
positive;Pleasantly presented establishment  Offering a full meal menu most of the day  We attended a drinks only late evening party  The staff were pleasant and accommodating  playing the music we wanted to hear  Drinks are quite expensive  but no worse than anywhere  In the London area 
positive; Came out for a friends birthday with  of us  Friendly staff  nice food and attentive service  Not to mention every main on the menu   the specials were  for We didn t wait too long to be served and being a Friday the pub wasn t packed but was busy  I had no problem with the Chicken Enchilada which was tasty and filling   Staff couldn t be nicer and were attentive without being invasive    Will be coming back :   
positive; Recently had a great meal with  friends  Staff very helpful and food was really lovely  Bill was reasonable and wine list very good  Really busy bar on Fri   Sat so lovely atmosphere  
positive; I like this place becoz its not too sophistcated but the food is really like going to an expensive hotel  most of the other buffets dont taste this good  The italian chicken in cream is really good  Chinese stir fry is my favourite with lots of chillies and chicken  I need to bring the whole family soon  
positive; The cake display in the shop window was the sole reason I ended up going inside this cafe  It was extremely hard to resist buying all of the cakes as each one looked so tempting but resist I did as I m trying to cut back on sugar  next time though I promised myself    I ended up trying the grilled cheese   leek on sourdough to takeaway which was okay  The cheese was deliciously stringy and the leeks were a complete game changer    During the time I waited for the sandwich to be cooked  the atmosphere in cafe seemed pleasant  we had a little chit chat with the co owner I believe who seemed passionate about his business and told us about how he and his family handmade all of the cakes etc which was a nice touch   The other younger staff however  seemed in a world of their own  Dare I say a little gormless   Regardless  I ll definitely be back and next time I ll be getting my hands on some of those delightful looking cakes  
positive; The Picked Plum serves really good food and Sunday lunch is dedicated to traditional English Sunday roast dining  The portions are large  the quality is good and the price if modest   The vegetarian options are somewhat limited  but what they do have on offer is very good    When we visited on Sunday th April there was live jazz  which I liked  but it was a little too loud for my elderly mother   still  it takes all sorts   I would definitely go again  
positive;Good location  just off M easy drive to Warwick   Leamington  This hotel is clean   pleasant but does not have any wow factor  it s obvious that it was originally an old grand house  the conversion into a hotel was done in the s and it shows  The buildings short comings are made up for by the staff who were friendly and welcoming   The indoor pool area is in need of renovation  but was clean and useable the warm stone beds were very relaxing  The gym a bit cramped but well equipped 
positive; Had not been for long time and decided for a cheap lunch   looked at menu and could not see early bird menu perhaps on main menu  but was not told about it or couldn t see it  Used to have pub classics like pies and curries  but menu was mainly chicken  Food we had was good and salad bar was great  looked at website once home and saw early bird menu   for two courses  which we would have had  Service was quick and enjoyed what we had but don t think there is enough choice to go regular  
positive; Had my birthday dinner there was eight of us and we all had an absolutely lovely meal and couldn t fault it at all   Highly recommended for lunch or dinner one of Oxford s good restaurants  
positive; I ve been here a couple of times  and always loved it  The atmosphere is lovely  often a bit loud but only because of large groups  The staff are great and service is executed in a effecient and pleasant manner  The starters are nice  but the pizzas for mains are gorgeous  My only fault  or rather me nit picking  is that the portions are rather large   or for me they are  Good quality  great value for money and you ll leave buzzing about the place and the food  
positive; Then the nut and squirrel is for you On a cold February day this hostelry was warm and inviting  We shared a baked camembert and my mum had the best cod and chips I ve seen in a long time  it was really good  I enjoyed my black pudding potato cake  in front of a warming fire a good time was had by all  
positive; Thought that the food was good and the whole novelty of seeing the food prepared is great  It was quite pricey  but as long as you realise that before then you re definitely in for a treat 
positive; Went here for a late breakfast as a birthday treat  Let me start by saying that the food and view are amazing  We ordered  plates between the two of us  the signature duck and waffle  Colombian eggs and the ox cheek benedict  and that was just about right  The service was efficient and the wait staff were friendly    The only down side was that the bar area feels a little tired  scuffed table legs etc   and could do with a bit a retouch  If you were to come in the evening then with atmospheric lighting this wouldn t be a problem   but in the day light these are noticeable   Defiantly one to try  
positive; I m always wary of going back to restaurants where I ve had great evenings in the past in case it s a let down  No let down here  another fabulous evening  A bit pricey but it s a treat 
positive; This is one of the best restaurants on the curry mile   the food is excellent and I have always enjoyed my meal   All the curries are tasty and I love the Peters Bread  chilli nan   The reason I don t go there all the time is that is is too busy on Friday and Saturday nights  If you haven t booked early you have to wait ages for a table  and it can be a bit too rowdy for us  a relaxing atmosphere it is not   Another problem is that the ladies loos are not always very clean  Thant said the food IS excellent   just best to go in the week  
positive; Visited the Radnor Arms in December with some dear friends  Was greeted with a warm welcome from Janine and a roaring fire which was most appreciated on a cold night  Had a lovely steak meal cooked to our liking served by very pleasant and attentive staff  Found the prices reasonable and good value for money  Hubby enjoyed the real ales also  Will definitely be retuning again soon  
positive; we regularly visit the brewers fayre in hastings  we have been going there for some years  obviously we have seen changes  at the present time we cannot fault it  the staff are all helpful and pleasant  the food is exceptional valve for money with several good offers available  yes sometimes you have to wait for a table at very busy times  but they always tell you the length of the wait and its up to you if you wait  we very rarely wait more than five minutes i would recommend this to family and friends 
positive; Celebration meal was made more special because of the lovely  fresh food and great atmosphere  Homemade pizza with a good selection of additional dishes We will be back  
positive; Salsa has a vibe you can t find anywhere else in London  I ve been on weekends  mid week and on the odd sunny afternoon this summer  Happy Hour cocktails  yes please  every time the atmosphere has been brilliant  on top of this every cocktail I ve had so far has been delicious  and the staff are always smiley when serving you even on a busy evening  Will be back very soon  
positive; Great food  all homemade great place to relax and meet friends  they even have a wood cabin if weather is bad 
positive; Very nice food and good service   warm and friendly on a cold foggy december day  Absolutely stuffed   
positive;Took a chance and decided to try The Oaks for a midweek dinner with family  glad we did as we had a really good evening  Good quality draught beer and ale served at the table  nice selection of wine available and pleasant atmosphere  The meals were no frills  good quality  well presented and cooked to a high standard  Excellent value for money but would have liked to see a wider choice on the menu and a specials board would add more variety  We intend to return very soon and would recommend people to look for this pub as it is hidden away in a quiet backwater  you wouldn t think you were inside the M  
positive; On approaching you might think twice  do not let it put you off  The main area is in a class of its own   there is a separate dog friendly area  A great selection of beers   good priced wines along with good reasonably priced food makes this a place to visit when in the area  
positive; We visited the restaurant on opening night  a well presented set up with nice tasteful decor  Good select of beers and ciders on the bar plus knowledgeable staff  The sharing starters are highly recommended   a nice way to tempt others in the party to try something different  Mains nice and a good selection of classics at reasonable prices  
positive; Ho ho s is always a lovely night out  A great menu that is more varied than some chinese restaurants and a quality that is also a cut above  Good service as well as great deals Sun Thursday  A regular haunt for us for daet night or with friends   Shame they don t deliver  but I appreciate that they don t want to compromise quality  
positive; First experience in a  Michelin star restaurant and perhaps this is why I was somewhat disappointed  Nothing was wrong the service was impeccable and the attention to detail second to none  I just thought I would experience an explosion of flavours which I can honestly say I didn t although it goes without saying that the food was all cooked to perfection  Michel was present and popped over to our table to ask if everything was ok which was a rather nice touch  Overall would I go again  Probably not  I think I would try a more trendy Michelin star restaurant next time around  
positive; On a romantic weekend away  my partner and I visited this restaurant partly because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we weren t disappointed  The food was excellent and very reasonably priced  Would definitely visit again 
positive;Ate here three times and very good pub food every time  Food hot and tasty and the nicest ploughman s I ve had for a long time
positive; Only popped in for a glass of wine  but made to feel so welcome by the staff  especially Abi  Wonderful looking food on offer  will definitely go for a meal next time  
positive; LOVE This place  Superb service and pleasant staff  Ordered off the lunch menu a winter vegetable wrap with humus and pesto  and a side of fries  other half had a chicken sandwich  all was excellent would like to return and try the dinner menu  
positive; Came here for a works meal out with colleagues  Ordered the steak which was cooked to perfection and exactly how I like it  The service was excellent and food was served swiftly  The price may seem expensive  however it is reasonable for the quality of food you receive  The layout and atmosphere is also nice within the building  Definite recommendation for anyone looking for a nice grown up meal out  
positive; I like this place as the staff are helpful and polite and they have a good range of full meals and snacks on sale  Plus they take the  quot Tastecard quot  so can be excellent value for money 
positive; Didn t book so had to wait in the bar  which was fine and although it wasn t busy in there the manager seemed to be stressed and ordering the other staff member about  We didn t have to wait long for our table  it was Graduation Day so understandably busy  and was shown to a lovely big table  only  of us  with a view over the dock   Lots of choice  waitress was lovely and patient whilst I was trying to get to grips with the options for sauces   The food was divine and the service was faultless  they were very busy but we didn t feel rushed or neglected  I d recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a nice steak  it was a cheap meal but we definitely got what we paid for and it was totally worth it  
positive; Title: A coastal river exemplar  ID#:    A fine place to go for a drink and some food   right on the bank  of the River Colne  Great atmosphere  fantastic publican   Claire   Well worth a visit  in a charming setting:  also supporters of the  Harwich Mayflower Project   gt    enjoy  gt  highly recommended  j  
positive; The food here is excellent  original  often based on traditional British dishes  beautifully presented  generous portions  great service and environment    The breakfast will keep you going all day  the  course lunch a brilliant deal  although beware  no choice  so no good for vegetarians  but plenty of the other dishes are  
positive; Just a shame my potatoes never arrived and had to go looking for them whilst meal cooled  Would visit again though if in the area  
positive;Although not a Vegetarian Vegan  I have eaten here  times now with a group of friends who love this Restaurant  and have thoroughly enjoyed the food and the atmosphere and found the staff very friendly  The only snag is finding somewhere to park  which shows how popular this place is   Go and try it 
positive; Went to the Hanover Street Social on Friday  May  The atmosphere was really nice but I was part of a group of   We were seated near the back so we didn t disturb too many people  The food was delicious however I have only given a score of  out of  because we printed the menu off the website before we went but when we got there the menu had changed  That was a little disappointing  The starter was chargrilled flat bread which was delicious  The main was a burger with american cheese and bacon  again delicious but the onion rings are to die for  Would also recommend the mojitos too  Everything was served together and not too long to wait between courses  
positive; I had a late lunch on Sunday here after a long walk in Regents park Even though it was full of dinners they managed to find us a table without having made a booking they serve a yummy roast all day but I opted for dressed crab and my favourites ham croquettes from the tapas menu    food was delicious as always and the waiter managed to make a couple of funny remarks and chat on occasion even though he seemed a little busy will definitely be going back soon as its a nice and relaxed atmosphere perfect for my little girl after running in the park all afternoon don t forget to pop out in the back patio area which has nice cushioned seats for a relaxing drink 
positive; Popped in for lunch after walk  we were impressed with lovely food  well cooked and nicely presented  worth a vusit 
positive; As a resident of Kingston upon Thames  I am a frequent visitor of Yo Sushi and must admit I am a great fan of their food  Depending on what time you go during the week  there is usually a queue on the weekends during peak hours where you will be expected to wait around   minutes but I suppose that just goes to show how popular the place is  The menu is constantly expanding  it has a lot more dishes on there compared to last year and they have also begun a delivery service for this branch which is great  What I like about this place is that it s always kept very clean  the staff are always pleasant and helpful and quick to serve you   This branch s dishes are kept consistent  there are other branches where the food does not always taste the same or has been left out for a good while so does not taste as fresh but Kingston remains one of my favourites in this sense  This is a good place to visit if you are into Japanese food for a good value and do not want to spend too long eating  Since I am a student  I receive % on weekdays off my food bill with NUS which is a great discount so I do not feel too guilty racking up the plates  Without the discount  I must admit it can get pricey if you order excessive  or certain luxury dishes so watch out if you are on a budget  The food is fresh  delicious and there are many options for those that do not necessarily like raw fish  or are vegetarian  
positive; We went here for the work Christmas social  where we had  courses  The food was delicious and the staff were very helpful  attentive and polite  The arrangement and size of the place allowed for us to have a room all to ourselves  so we weren t disturbed  didn t disturb others  
positive; Consistently good  especially if you love French food  And it s great to see rabbit on the menu  They have a very good value set menu to choose from for lunch  And also specials of the day  The wine list is fairly extensive and clearly Structured so you can choose a wine to suit your palette  It s a shame this restaurant is not my local as I would be there more often  Any chance of opening one near Wimbledon  
positive; We have had meals here on several occations and have always been able to have gluton free option  inluding yorkshire puddings and scrumptious home made cakes 
positive;You always get a great welcome from the staff and management of this establishment which is not always the case with busy central London pubs  Just the warm welcome is worth going there for 
positive; Aqua is also another lovely restaurant in Blackheath  I find it hard to choose between Aqua and Chapters    The service is always immaculate and friendly  They know not to bring your meals out to quickly  The food is lovely  from starters to main  unfortunately I do not have a sweet tooth so have not ordered dessert I like this restaurant  it is cozy  inviting and just a really great atmosphere  The sea food platter is amazing  not too much  just quite right   The beef stafido is also lovely  and possibly my favourite dish  I have been here quite a few times  possibly about  times in    Great value for money  and have recommended this restaurant to family and friends  who have also enjoyed their meals    The lobster is lovely  but just not enough of it  
positive; Food: fresh  good quality  big portions  value for money  Extras  curry sauce etc  available for a small additional fee   Service: prompt  friendly  good quality  Waited a small while   but this was waiting for the fish and chips to cook   fresh to order   Location: easily accessible  right by the harbour side  good views if you were to eat in   Advice: queue at the correct entrance   one to eat in  one for take away   Special extras: sweet potato crisps included as part of the price  in my opinion unnecessary  but quirky 
positive; Very charming place to eat  Prices were not to over the top  Calamari starter was very good  The wild mushroom starter was good too  My daughter had fillet steak which was cooked to her request the only downfall was the sweet potato fries which were covered in salt therefore she did not eat them  I had mussels in a cream sauce  Unfortunately the mussels were very small and looked like they came out of a packet  The sauce was very tasty but they served them with fries  I asked for bread to go with the meal  The staff were knowledgeable about the menu and were very friendly  I would go back but would not get the mussels  
positive; We ve been a few times to this place  The booths are comfy  The menu has good choice  We ve had the big platters to share   enjoyed them  Never managed to try dessert  Toilets are decent   parking no problem  
positive; This is a friendly  family run French cafe bistro in one of the town centre s more picturesque streets  I ve only been there during the day  for coffee or lunch  The food was well presented  fresh and tasty and I would certainly return  I d say the price was reasonable  there are more expensive options such as steak  my son had this and said it was very nice  Frederic s certainly makes a change from the ubiquitous chain restaurants overwhelming our towns  The staff are friendly and businesslike  
positive; Ordered on line   a fun and easy way to order your meal  Arranged for collection at worst part was finding an appropriate parking space in Horsham to collect but once one was located the rest of the experience was easy and straightforward  Arrived back home just after   with a delicious spread ahead of us  Everything we bought was just so tasty and delicious  Overall a great experience and one we will repeat again and again  
positive; We ve stayed in this hotel occasionally for decades and we have always enjoyed it  Under current ownership it seems to be flourishing  The hotel has some very old parts  its well situated for walking and for generally visiting the lake district and I can recommend it  We stayed for  nights and ate in the bar  Its pub food but it was fine  The breakfasts were good and the staff pleasant  
positive; I visted this restaurant on the Top Table % deal which made it great value for money  I opted for the mixed thali which was a little bit of everything which was a great way to sample many dishes without breaking the bank  the thali was served in the traditional way which was also very nice  The portion sizes at Sheraz are huge and neither myself or my partner could finish anything  the restaurant packed all the remaining food which we took away and had for dinner  The service was attentive and not intrusive  the restaurant lacked an atmosphere as it was practically empty except for one other table however it was a Tuesday lunch time  I would like to try the restaurant during the evening  
positive; Visited this restaurant with my partner and a couple of our friends for the first time on Sunday evening  Staff were wonderfully attentive  service was prompt and there was a nice feel about the place  The food was exceptionally good   starters and mains were great   my partner s steak was the best he had eaten for many a year and it is not often a restaurant asks how you would like your lamb cutlets cooked  Only one thing stopped me from giving this an  Excellent  rating   Service charge was automatically added  That  I do not like  I have always believed it is up to the customer to leave what they wish  As to the cost inclusive of service charge for    starters  main and drinks    not something I could do every week but will I go back  Of course  
positive; Went here for the st time for a Xmas party with  others  The food was excellent  not greasy as some Chinese food can be  very fresh and served quickly  The service was attentive but not intrusive  The only thing small criticism I would make is that the restaurant lacks atmosphere  The lighting is bright and would be better slightly dimmed and it did not have much of a Xmas feel  
positive;The location was great  we had the table right by the window so overlooked the bay  The food was brilliant and they serve a home made garlic loaf bread at the start with some sort of spread which was very good  The restaurant is a little pricey  we had the lobster which was   and our total bill was over   for two starters  two mains a small glass of wine and lemonade   So ok for a treat special occasion 
positive; Enjoyed an evening meal here   a good selection of dishes  and my king prawn curry was almost as a good as the original I enjoyed in Kerela  Everyone else in my party enjoyed their dishes  My only comment  and thus not five stars  is that my dish was not as hot  as in temperature  on arriving as I like food to be   Not too many tables  like some Oxford restaurants  and jazzy background music  
positive; Stayed for  nights on business at NEC  Delightful village  great to get away from all bustle around the nEC  Room was adequate and clean  staff very helpful and friendly  Would definitely stay again  
positive;Went to Dim T s on a Monday evening with a friend  I booked in advance because we really wanted a window seat and I had heard it could be quite busy because they don t open the first floor in the week  Due to travel chaos we were  minutes late but I called to let them know and they were absolutely fine with it  It was really busy but we got our window seat and the views were amazing  We had vegetable spring rolls and Dim Sum to start  having had really disappointing spring rolls elsewhere I thought these ones were really nice  also my first time trying Dim Sum and I was equally impressed  Had the yasai yaki soba  with tofu  which was very tasty  I m not going to comment on the authenticness because I wouldn t know what I was talking about but I can review that it has a really good menu   especially for an occasionally fussy vegetarian  the food was really nice and the views were amazing  As for service I was worried seeing other reviews and will admit that it was quite slow  not overly attentive  quite disorganised and took a while to get the bill  however the staff were friendly and it didn t in anyway spoil the evening 
positive; We have been going to the Petersham Restaurant for many years  because of the view and the food  We were back there last night  and the table service and quality of food haven t changed at all  The only detail that I would like to point out is that we checked in to stay overnight in the hotel  and on checking in at about pm we asked reception to book us a table at the restaurant  only to be told that it was fully booked already  About half hour later  when we returned downstairs and walked through the restaurant  we commented with the gentlemen at the restaurant reception that it was a pity not to be able to have dinner there  and they said that it wasn t a problem  that they did have availability  However  we must have dinner at the latest by : as they were fully booked for later  We stayed in the restaurant and then bar  until after pm  drinking after dinner  and noticed that throughout the evening the restaurant was never more than half full  Well Something must be looked into by the management    One doesn t expect that from the Petersham   
positive; Amazing food best place to go for meat  tender steaks and lamb sheesh kebabs  One of the best places for luscious homemade desserts   Gave  out of  stars though as the decor of the restaurant is a bit outdated and old fashioned but the food and service could not be faulted  
positive;After going for a meal with my friends  we was looking for a nice bar with some music  We had been recommended Foundation Bar so thought we would give it go   The drinks were standard London prices however were served in Jam Jars and Tea Pots which we all loved  My Strawberry Margarita even came with sugar strands around the top   Atmosphere was really good however we felt that the music was a bit random   But I suppose there was something for everyone 
positive;  of us had lunch very good value for money family reunion will try Sunday lunch and let u know how we find easy reach fromserounding villages only a w miles from durham 
positive; Nicely refurbished  we booked table because seen it gets really busy  Started a bit disappointed that table was upstairs  the atmosphere and bar downstairs much better   so when booking recommend you ask for table   booth downstairs  Tapas style and  small plates substantial   was lovely   only gripe is prawn salad wrapped in rice paper had minimal prawn  Everything else fab  Service  drinks were good   As it got later we went downstairs to sit at the bar an enjoy cocktails of which there was limited range but the amaretto sour Bellini went down very well 
positive; The location is convenient if you are visiting British Museum or any of the London s attractions in the Bloomsbury area  Dickens  museum is really close   I love the atmosphere at Bea s  prefer this one over the St Paul s location though it is small and sometimes  on a rainy day with lots of visitors  crowded  Try dark chocolate raspberry cupcake with a cup of peppermint tea or go for a more traditional vanilla favoured cupcake with some cappuccino  Service is prompt and nice  no one fusses around and forces you to leave  This relaxed atmosphere in a generally busy Bloomsbury is truly a treasure  
positive; Whenever I am meeting friends in Beverley or taking visitors to Beverley  I always take them to Vanessa s as the food is homemade  always tasty  caters for many tastes and is reasonably priced  Love shopping for favourites afterwards in the deli below  It is quirky  comfortable  busy at lunch and tea times and has steep stairs for access but well worth a visit  
positive; We have just moved into the area and we love the Saracens Head  We ve been for Sunday lunch with the kids  for a pizza feast with all the family  and the dog  who was made to feel really welcome in front of the real fire in the bar area   and on a rare night out as a couple  The food is great  the atmosphere is lovely and the staff are really friendly and accommodating  It s rare you find a pub that ticks all the boxes  but we are really pleased that this place is in our area  Oh  and the mojitos are divine  
positive;Booked a table for  people last Saturday evening  On arrival it was clear that it was really busy but we didn t mind waiting in the bar area  I m not sure if there was a mix up with tables as we ended up staying on our rather slanted table in the bar area rather than being taken into the restaurant  again we didn t mind as it was clear the staff were rushed off their feet  but were all very friendly and welcoming  To say it was as busy as it was the food was perfect  The blackened chicken was gorgeous  would definitely recommend  Will most certainly be returning but might try earlier in the evening so its not as busy 
positive; Four of us had a most enjoyable lunch at Thea Caffea last week  Tucked away down a narrow alley  this light  airy  traditional tea room was busy and popular  All our different choices of food were very tasty and well presented  The use of old style floral patterned teacups  saucers and teapots and loose tea is a lovely touch and totally in keeping with the elegant  old style decor of the place  The staff were very efficient  polite and friendly  Thea Caffea was recommended to us and we have no hesitation in recommending it ourselves  
positive; Visited Baffito s on a Friday evening  the food was delicious and the portions for both the starters and mains are massive   I have been a couple of times now and never had a bad meal  The service was OK but as we were served by about  different people  it got confusing whether I needed to repeat my order to the next waiter than came over  Overall  really nice decor  nice food and good beer selection  Its worth a visit  
positive; An unconventional culinary experience   Ambience was great  food was cooked to perfection and staff were kind  friendly and unconventional  If your in the mood for a laid back dining experience  I guarantee you will not be disappointed   
positive; Went here on a recommendation from my sister and family as kids eat for free  We had burgers and they were enormous and clearly homemade  chips were delicious though you don t get many  Kids ate for free and the fish goujons were ok for my  year old  but the pasta was very disappointing   Luke warm pasta spirals with basically tomato purÇ¸e dumped on the top  did not satisfy my  year old boy  who ended up eating my chips  Ok for the price paid but personally we didn t find the portions big enough for the children  
positive; We shared  starters between us  quarter crispy duck and lettuce wraps  and we were full after that  But we each also had a very appropriately names  quot Big Bowl quot  soup  None of us even finished a quarter of it   The soups were tasty and  as I mentioned  huge  The starters were very generous size and absolutely delicious  We had loads of the duck fillings left over once we d finished the  pancakes  The wine was quite nice and reasonably priced too  Only downsides were  although we went at  and had no desserts we felt very hurried out the door  I guess a Thursday night is not meant to be the latest of evenings  
positive; My partner and I stumbled across this restaurant walking through the  back streets  to our hotel  We looked it up on Tripadvisor were we saw a few mixed reviews but decided to give it a try  They were very busy but we managed to book a table for pm  We both thought the ambience  staff and food were very good  I opted for the grilled market fish of the day which happened to be plaice and my partner had Pla samrot   Thai three flavours fish  Both dished were tasty and well cooked  
positive; Great place for a relaxing lunch or tea call in for good food after a walk in the country  superb beer too  
positive; Stumbled across this pub last week  Nov   whilst  doing  Shropshire  It was a pleasure to find somewhere that wasn t corporate or that had been  plasticized    We had baguettes and soup  My friend thought the soup was delicious and the baguettes were first class  lovely and crispy and warm  So often baguettes are soggy  Would certainly call here again if we are ever in the area  
positive;A good place to relax after visiting the Albert Dock  Pleasant  helpful staff and an interesting building with good views of Liverpool 
positive; I have often been to giraffe when shopping or visiting cabot circus and have always had a nice meal  Reccommed the bbq chicken and cheddar quesadilla and sweet potato fries which is a filling portion The drinks are also great and they often have deals on Staff are always friendly and accommodating and are happy to help if your not sure what you want  
positive; We booked for my sons birthday meal as he wanted to attempt the  quot Bear Challenge quot   which he failed    We were a party of  and were looked after really well  Service was slow to start with but Adam took the helm and was fantastically attentive  The food was really good  We had nachos and breads to start followed by a different array of burgers  gammon and the mixed grills  A great night out  
positive; As a local  this is our place of choice when we eat out   Food has been good  only had  or  bad meals   Chefs Chicken is amazing   The tomato sauce is to die for   Would recommend  
positive;A well positioned pub  off the beaten track  really popular with a   something crowd as well as + diners in the restaurant too  The restaurant is quite smart and offers a good menu always with nice fresh seafood available  Service can be a bit hit or miss as staff seem to change between my visits  but overall they are professional and polite and the food is turned around quickly  A good wine list is available and it is nice to chill out in the bar of the pub before or after dining 
positive; Visited here for lunch at the weekend  it was quite busy but we managed to get a table  I personally as a young couple felt out of place and felt like a lot of the other customers were looking at us  However the staff were very warm and welcoming  we ordered a jacket potato and a sandwich   the food was lovely and presented nicely  it was also quite quick to come after ordering   It is however a little bit of an expensive place for what it is for a jacket potato and sandwich and a bottle of water it cost us   something  
positive;I have been here about six times now and on every occasion the food was beautiful as are the views  The food is slightly pricey but then there s generally plenty of it and its tastey  The views are absolutely amazing and if you fancy walking your meal off you re in a great location to do it 
positive; I love eating here and they regularly have deals online that you can get if you sign up to their emails  The food is great and prices are cheap even without vouchers  The only problem is some of the staff can barely understand English  and we once had a waitress who said she would bring us a bottle of  quot merlot sauvignon blanc quot   don t know how thats possible  tried to correct her twice   she smiled and nodded and laughed  as if she understood but clearly she didn t  Apart from that  it s a great place to eat on a lower budget  
positive;Came upon Kensington Place by chance yesterday afternoon   and we were all very happy to have discovered it  The building is quite quirky   a little like a converted office block   but light and airy with nice artwork  The staff were very helpful and attentive  The food was actually delicious  even for the non fish eater  I had the artichoke risotto  yum   and the passion fruit posset   both lovely  My non carnivorous friends did comment on the number of fish dishes that also contained meat in some form  but that aside  it was an imaginative  tasty and well priced meal  and the wine was good  I would definitely recommend to others 
positive;First time visit and won t be our last  Recommended by our son who was visiting us and who used to live in Leeds  Popped in on spur of moment around pm on a Saturday evening  Very busy but managed to find a table  Great atmosphere with lovely views of the river  Good choice of food   a little pricey but guess due to being the centre of Leeds with such a good view  My son and I chose the chicken Hanging Derrick which was beautiful  My husband had the steak one which he said was quite tough  All in all the visit was good and we will go again  Our usual place is the Adelphi whilst in Leeds but as this was packed and a long wait for food we are so pleased we decided to go to this one   definitely our first choice now 
positive; A welcoming  friendly bistro with an extensive menu which includes reasonably priced  value for money dressed crab  For those of us who do not share the love of fish there is a varied selection of alternative dishes all equally reasonably priced  All the food is freshly prepared  well presented  with the well sized portions being hot and tasty  Along with a wide range of pastries  cakes and snacks  together with a selection of hot or cold drinks  there s something to suit everyone s tastes   While it s slightly off the main area of the town  don t ignore this excellent bistro  Seek it out and enjoy their home made food  
positive; Indian Fusion   my first experience of this cuisine and loved it  Staff were very friendly and communicative   food delicious   P 
positive; Lovely food  nice variety on the menu and the setting and location is lovely  The restaurant is very intimate and romantic so perfect if you re looking for a night out with your other half  The downstairs is a lovely bar perfect for drinks before or after your meal  We had a really friendly waitress and the food came out promptly  as did our drink orders 
positive; We had a wonderful time here with our eighteen month year old  the staff are so accommodating and the food was prompt and delicious even whilst the restaurant was so  so busy  Marco the waiter was so charming and helpful and never made us feel rushed  What a wonderful experience  
positive; Booked for the chicken Sunday roast in advanced as suggested    Recommend the peanut butter milkshake   proper thick shake that was lush   Gravy was sweeter than normal but tasty   they pour some gravy on just incase you don t wish to have that I d let them them know beforehand  roasties had that extra crunch on the outside   my favourite   A little overpriced for a roast dinner but enjoyed it none the less  very filling indeed  Staff could cheer up slightly    
positive; I m a little suspicious by some of the other reviews of this restaurant  which vary from  star over the top enthusiasm to dire warnings of health risks  My feeling is that while it wasn t perfect  the food was good on the whole  Just one waiter seemed a little unfriendly  but the rest were fine and helpful   the menu is unconventional  with much more than the usual range of dishes available at the average Indian restaurant  so we needed some guidance  After we had ordered  which took us a while  the food arrived reasonably quickly and was very tasty  the only thing I didn t like was one of the meats in the meat thali starter   It certainly wasn t oily or greasy  Yes  some food colouring was used  but no more than is normal in Indian restaurants  I see some of the negative reviews are of takeaways  which I have no experience of  so all I can say is try eating in the restaurant   I don t think you ll be disappointed    Incidentally  some of the bad reviews had concerned me so much that before we went in I asked a family on their way to eat in the restaurant whether they had eaten there before  and if so  whether it was any good  They said they had  and that it was good  And the restaurant was full that night  from early in the evening  
positive; It s really quite hard to get decent fish   chips by the seaside in the south isn t it  But the Pilot does just that  Decent portions  and a choice   fresh fish  crispy batter  grilled poached options too   the chips could be improved   crispy but a bit too hard for my liking  I also like that the Pilot makes a point of buying local produce  Romney Marsh lamb for example   I love the atmosphere too  full of locals all year round   it s a fab place to hunker down in the winter or on chillier autumn   spring days  in the summer you can eat outside with views out over the shingle to the sea  I m a regular when in the area   good stuff  
positive;This is the back up takeaway if dinner fails   Great food and friendly staff  Recommend to anyone and everyone 
positive; Ideal walking distance to cinema  What could be better  Good food  good service at a reasonable price 
positive; We had a very nice breakfast here  The prices were good for a cooked breakfast was the most expensive option  and the owners were very friendly  Was it the best breakfast I ve ever had  No  Was it just what we wanted and a very nice plate of food  Yes  The cafe itself was small but pleasant enough  I would gladly come here again  
positive; had a lovely meal with family and friends at the weekend  food was excellent  and priced accordingly  unfortunately they ran out of the wine and beer we were drinking half way through the meal so had to change  this was our first visit since the place changed hands name  from Vemillion  and will definately be back 
positive; we go here most Saturdays the food is realy good plenty variety some times we go on a sunday and you can get sunday lunch which is nice staff very friendly good price 
positive;Really excellent food well prepared and presented although choice not that extensive but regardless of that all choices are at a reasonable price what more can you ask
positive; We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our meal  mainly because the front of house staff were very young and not all that experienced  but very nice and welcoming  The food was good  reasonably priced  and adventurous  
positive; Visited on Saturday  very busy but did not have to wait too long to be seated  Had the mussels for starter followed by chicken in cream and mushroom sauce with fresh vegetables and would recommend 
positive; Food was fine and reasonable priced  good portions and staff attentive  Useful for people staying at Premier Inn next door  breakfast good too 
positive;Nice pub around the harbour in Brixham  the staff tried hard to help with whatever my kids wanted to eat for evening meal  We wanted to use local business whilst on holiday rather than the groups and happy to advise this pub came up trumps 
positive;Took my mum here for a meal on a week night  appearance on the outside is slightly shabby but don t let it put you off  Food is very good and plentiful  Staff attentive but not overly so  We had the vegetarian set menu and it was fantastic  It s nice when places make an effort for vegetarians and always very appreciated  Also at   a head brilliant value for  courses and tea or coffee at the end  I would recommend highly 
positive; Loved this restaurant  the food was so tasty i ate everything of my  courses  the restaurant looked clean and fresh and the food was fresh too  only negative was i asked our waitress what a chantilly sauce was and she didn t know  even after she had asked the chefs the same question  they obviously didn t know either even though they are pouring it all over the profiteroles  Also she didn t know what was in the ice cream  i cant remember the name of it now  the waiting staff should have a good knowledge of the food they are serving  
positive;Food is just wonderful and very plentiful  with quite a few vegetarian options  Service is friendly but not intrusive  Your food does not arrive quickly as it is all freshly cooked   and you can see your bread going into the oven  Very good value  too  As someone who is white british it is lovely to taste food that is quite different from the usual fare available on the High St    even in London 
positive; Food was good  service was good  Only downside was not alot of room  
positive;We ate here under recommendation from the hotel we were staying at  it was a lovely restaurant with a relaxed feel  the staff were very attentive without being intrusive  The food was good 
positive; I liked it all service was good food was delicious and its local x  I have been here a few times to the restaurant in shepperton as my children go to school nearby its convienient and the only place that allows children late evening  in Italy they allow children and dogs any time of the day and night  here we don t like either so if you get caught up over here you have had it  but prezzo don t mind children at all  I have been here with friends and have always had a really good time  thank you x 
positive; Went there today in hope to find some authentic Indonesian food  Being not only a foodie but also born into an Indonesian family  I was sceptical about giving this place a go  But I was not disappointed   what a find  Tucked away in a little side street off East Street  locals and tourists are a treated to a real taste of Indonesia  To my relief  the chefs are from Bali and Sumatra and not from some other Asian country assuming they can use their transferrable skills on just any cuisine  I had a beautifully decorated Nasi Campur that I can only recommend  Will definitely be back  
positive; Food always taste the same  always good  feels posh  prices have gone up quite a bit hence the  points  otherwise would have been   
positive; This place is so much better since the refurbishment  but I still feel it lacks atmosphere  I think it s something to do with the layout  The food has definitely improved  I had the burger with bacon and cheese and it was delightful  A huge meaty burger  little fat  crunchy salad and crisp fries  The steak comes highly recommended by my boyfriend  although not to my taste and the fish and chips were also great  quality fish with light crispy batter  This pub restaurant hotel will always be busy because of the fabulous location  but it could be sooooo much better  
positive; A beautiful restaurant  especially upstairs under the romantic fairy lit tree  The food is reliable and tasty  My only comment would be that they do know how popular they are and this is sometimes reflected in the atmosphere  
positive; The experience itself was fab   you literally can t see your hand in front of your face  It made for a really funny and different Mother s Day experience    However  I have to agree with a number of the reviews in that although the food was tasty  there was so little of it on the plate  We searched with our hands to find it  but were all left wanting   and wondering if it had slipped off the plate before it got to us  We tried to reason with ourselves   perhaps it s just perception  that you can t see the food and so think you ve got less  but we concluded that our portions were just ridiculously small  We did mention it to the staff  but it seems that s the way it is because it s  quot nouvelle cuisine quot  style and you have to accept it  Well  that s the only reason I would never return   it s much too expensive for a couple of mouthfuls of food   something the restaurant could so easily rectify if they wanted to  
positive;We were a mixed group of big meat eaters and one vegetarian and we all had a great time  The booth was comfy  the prosecco our chosen tipple and our food was a mix of burgers  steak and a widow maker hot dog  I loved the sweet potato fries as well as my bean burger 
positive; The place was packed  and despite this the service was still spot on They gave us chairs near the windows and this was better as we could hear each other as we were side by side The place was quite loud but that s because it was so packed The food was excellent The pork belly was lovely as was the tofu udon  We enjoyed the sake and the added bonus was that it was only   for a rather large bottle  
positive; The food is good but the set menu on Mothers day made us feel constricted and it was very pricey for pub meal  
positive; Thanks  Steph and team  for the great  course  French themed celebratory dinner that you recently provided for us  all  of us  Our guest of honour was thrilled  and many in our group who had not previously been to the Seven Stars were so delighted with their discovery that they are already planning their next visit  
positive; had a very good Sunday lunch there yesterday  very good value for money  shame the are becoming so popular they ran out of lamb  shame  had to have the beef instead  
positive;We went here as on our tour  footprints  the guide explained how this little pub  down an alleyway which used to be called Hell s Passage  now Helen s passage  used to be were all misdeeds were down as it laid just outside the old city walls  Intruigued we thought we d try it out  It is tiny  not much seating inside but plenty outside and just get an atmosphere of history  We managed to sit inside where my husband tried a local pint and I had mulled wine  which was delicious and warmed me up nicely after walking around in the chilly wind 
positive; We often dine at the Maltings Kitchen and have always found the food to be very tasty  also they have a good choice of scones and home cooked cakes etc  The staff are always friendly and helpful  the views over the river Tweed are really interesting  taking in all three Tweed Bridges  
positive; My husband and I visited the restaurant and ordered the Meze special which was a  piece combo for two priced at  pp we received our starter it was lovely and a great deal to choose from the our main which was beautiful the meat dishes were so tender you did not even need to chew  The portions were very large and we certainly did not go home hungry  The staff were friendly and helpful  The service was exceptionally fast  The restaurant is small therefore the tables are very close to each other and unfortunately for us there was a very loud over powering lady on the table behind us which caused the relaxing atmosphere to become very unwelcoming  
positive; My husband and I visited the Toby Carvery for an afternoon roast on our Wedding Anniversary  the waitress was very attentive  and took great care of us  The meats were lovely  the portion was a little small  the vegetables were nice  the roast potatoes were spot on  there were no Yorkshire puddings due to a problem with the ovens    I had a glass of wine with my dinner and it was a delicious white zinfandel  Overall very nice 
positive; Visited the restaurant on Saturday and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service  The only disappointment was my starter of bubble and squeak  some the potato in it was still raw  The rest of the meal was really nice and the service was excellent  
positive; Lovely place different setting to go for a birthday or special meal iv been twice    try not to fill up on all the rice and noodles they give as you wont be able to fit the meat  fish highly recomend also they will put on a great show 
positive; We arrived quite late at night and they accommodated us although there were some items from the menu not available  The waitress on Sunday evening was fantastic  We had a breaded chicken which was ok but a little dry for my taste however the spaghetti on the side was absolutely superb  My boyfriend had a steak and ordered it medium rare but it came medium well we thought so just something to keep in mind  
positive; We have been a few times now for the carvery which is excellent value for money and thought we would try the pie night  We were not disappointed  A choice of  pies  mash and a choice of garden mushy peas all for  The staff are always very friendly and have great customer service and we have always had a comfortable welcome from the locals   I was surprised when reading some of the other comments  however having ordered once before from the daily menu I agree it doesn t come anywhere close to the standard of the carvery and their pies  I would always recommend this to friends and feel lucky we have this place close to where we live  especially when you fancy a mid week roast just like your mums  
positive; Seafood for me goes beyond fish and chips  so if you re looking for a delectable experience in Cambridge  this is a must visit  The nice old building has a cosy  pub like feel  and can get a bit crowded  But it is amazing what they can do with fish  including lovely soups  Thai curries and a menu that always has something new to offer  I love to keep going back  
positive; The service was very friendly and inviting  Food was delicious and well presented  I would have returned had I been staying in Mullion for longer than a week  
positive;Really good atmosphere  friendly  chatty staff   the food was scrummy  Highly recommend the chicken starters   beef 
positive; As a regular eater at harvester restaurants this one lived up to my usual standards of a great harvester :  the salad bar was fresh and topped up frequently  nothing ran out which normally happens with the bread rolls  All the staff where very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble  Great food and great service especially as it was a busy saturday night  standards still stayed high  The only negative thing I have to say about this particular harvester is unlike some of the others  the unlimited drinks machine hasnt been updated to the new touch screens which allows you to add cordial flavours to your drinks and the option of tango apple  Other than that it was a great meal and pleasant evening all round 
positive; Menu extensive  Received a warm welcome  Waiters attentive  but discreet  Drinks arrived quickly followed by starters  Asked by waiter if ready for main course even got complimentary dish to help soothe heat for main course  After paying bill and receiving rose  was told no rush in leaving could take our time 
positive; Lovely place and atmosphere  lovely menu especially the tapa s  fab cocktails  for   between  and  Friendly staff well worth a visit   
positive;Good takeaways as well as good restaurant food and experience  Friendly staff and delightful ambience in the restaurant  Eat under a starlit ceiling delicious specialties and lovely baltis love the mushroom pilau 
positive; had a meal out with family  hadn t been out together for a while  The food was ok with plenty of choice  No waitress to take our order so had to order at the bar  ok but as there was a few of us it could have been handled better  Will go back again but maybe book next time  
positive; Lovely food  Wasn t much on the menu choice wise for different flavours of pizza and cocktails were very expensive  But we took our two dogs and sat outside a couple of other dogs on the courtyard very dog friendly  
positive; I have been here about five times and I think it is a great Italian restaurant  It is located in a very good area in Jesmond and it is reasonably easy to find  I have been during the day and later at night  it is usually quite busy in the day but very busy at night and it has a nice chatty atmosphere    The staff are very polite and welcoming  The food is beautiful and the menu has a wide range of choice from pizza and pasta to chicken and steak  The starters are nice and even though they don t do that many deserts  the ones they do are nice  I think the menu is well priced and a lot cheaper than some other Italian restaurants and definitely as good  I would recommend the potato skins and the penne Napoli which is simple but delicious   I would recommend the  course special as it is great value and works out quite a bit cheaper  Santana s is a great restaurant and it has a lovely atmosphere and the food is very nice  It is not too expensive and a place to go with partners  friends and family  It is also a good place to go if you have young children  
positive; The restaurant is friendly and welcoming  the food is hot and delicious  Suitable for family ocassions or more intimate ocassions  
positive; We had a pre Christmas lunch  ordered from the main menu  Everything we had was fantastic and experienced friendly  efficient service  
positive; Great food  lovely staff  a fab children s menu and very reasonable prices   I thoroughly recommend it  
positive; My friends and I visit Panchuli fairly regularly for a combination of factors  Firstly  the food is excellent with a vast variety of dishes to choose from  The sharing platters we ordered for our starters were delicious and good value  and we were all very satisfied with our mains  Secondly  the service  Which is very good  but also hilarious at the same time  The staff are incredibly attentive  but also enjoy a bit of banter  with us anyway    but on occasion slightly calamitous  we have witnesses a waistcoat being set on fire  and a hilarious incident with an awol birthday cake   I would certainly recommend a visit to Panchuli  you won t be disappointed  
positive; Aldo s is always a restaurant I go back to and enjoy the food  The staff are very attentive with my little boy although sometimes the service is hit and miss depending on how busy the restaurant is  I d highly recommend the Rib Eye Steak Tagliata which is often on the specials board  
positive;We had a nice pub meal here before we went to the theatre We had a  course  quot Golden Years quot  meal which was tasty well presented and very well served by very good staff  It was our st visit to the Merlin it won t be our last  
positive; The service was fabulous and the scones were delicious  Jam selection and ample cream provided  The tea selection offered was also fantastic and there was a wide range of classic cakes  I m not sure the atmosphere was quite right for Afternoon Tea  it s a little dark inside etc  probably more suited to a nice dinner  but I can t fault the service  food and price  
positive; Enjoyed crab and linguine lunch and Greek style salad  Good portions  good value  good service  Good puddings too  a nice bustle about the restaurant  Recommended  
positive; Cant really understand the negative reviews  Our local Chinese   always deliver great food and delivered promptly  Never hada problem 
positive;came here many times and Always enjoyed the food the only thing i would suggest is to improve the service    the pizzas are the best
positive; There have been some new dishes put on the menu and they re bloomin tasty  I think they have a new chef  I used to like the  for   menu before pm  bring this back please  The pub is lovely and the staff are friendly  maybe some more offers to increase sales as it s fairly quiet most of the time  Would recommend 
positive; Visited here with friends and we all agreed what a great place it was  thoroughly enjoyed ourselves with top rated traditional food 
positive; I am so glad that Hereford has finally got some more well known food chains  especially for the younger generation  there s really only so much of McDonalds you can have   I love the Frankie   Benny s in Hereford  the staff are really friendly and welcoming  the service is great and the foods really very good   The only downside I would say is sometimes it does take a long time for the staff to come back once you ve asked for the bill  I ve had a few experiences when they take ages  even though it may not be that busy there  Overall though  I would definitely reccomend it to friends and family  
positive; I went on a weekend to Sunderland and went to this restaurant for a meal  I really can t fault this little place  The service was friendly and efficient  Really friendly staff and manager  so great hospitality  I ordered  quot Di mare quot  pasta for main course and it was really tasty and arrived quickly  I would say the portion sizes were very generous  very filling as it left no room for dessert  I don t think their menu it s too pricey  It has a very relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere  The outside area is a bonus  The overall experience was    I have no hesitation in recommending Amore  to anyone who wants a decent restaurant  with nice Italian food and pleasant and welcoming atmosphere   Teresa  Leeds 
positive; So delighted when Old Millwrights had their recent revamp   it is the closest pub to our flat in Aylesbury and we hadn t used the pub previously due to it s historic venue as a more  working man s bar   The interior is lovely  well decorated  friendly and welcoming but the outside space is such a MISSED OPPORTUNITY  Went for an evening meal during the warm period and the whole area needed a good brush with a broom  The tables were smeared with cleaning fluid but not dried to a shine   making them look a little unhygienic   there were troughs of dead flowers alongside one wall where the staff hadn t bothered to water them on a daily basis and one or two hanging baskets heading the same way    Come on chaps  clean sparkling metal tables  lots of colourful summer bedding  a string of lights or lanterns and maybe a citronella candle on each table   you would make a bomb with outside diners   even on a chilly night as outside space a premium in the middle of town    Keep it classy  keep it stylish   keep it busy    Could be such an asset    
positive;The food was excellent and the staff were pleasant and friendly  Having gone through several owners it is lovely to see this restaurant thriving 
positive; We stayed here for  nights during the Lyme Regis folk festival  Good comfortable rooms Excellent breakfast with a beautiful array of fresh fruit all along the bar  Their real ale and wine was very good  Our friends ordered a crab baguette which was plenty enough for both of them which was delicious   The staff are all very friendly and helpful  We will be returning   
positive; We stopped here without a reservation on Sunday for lunch  It is a fairly small pub and they were really busy but they were really helpful and friendly and managed to fit us in  We really liked that they had trivial pursuit cards on the table to occupy you whilst waiting for the food  We ordered  roast dinners  lamb   beef and a gammon which came with pigs in blankets  It was a really decent portion and everything was cooked really well  There was a great choice of fresh veg that came in separate bowls too  We were all too stuffed to eat dessert so can t comment on that but those on the table next to us looked lovely  Would reccommend a visit  
positive;We regularly visit in the afternoon when we go shopping in the lanes  great value for the set menu option
positive; Our favourite Chinese in Birmingham  We ve been several times and it never disappoints  Will definitely be coming back  
positive; I feel people will often leave reviews if they are unhappy about something and not necessarily leave a positive review if they have a good experience  so wanted to go someway to correct that  I went to Cucarachas on Sat st Sept   for my sister s hen do  There were  of us  We were seated promptly and a waitress came and took our drinks order within a few minutes of us arriving  She returned to take our food orders a little while after  We had to wait maybe  minutes for our main courses   but nobody ordered starters or nachos etc   so it was understandable we had to wait a while for them to cook  main dishes  When our food arrived it all came out together  The portions were gigantic and many people struggled to finish  Everyone commented that their food was delicious  Yes  it is more Americanized Mexican than authenic but as long as you understand that before you go I don t think you ll be disappointed  The atmosphere was lively and the place was full with people queuing by the door for a table  Our bill arrived promptly once we asked for it and the average cost of a main course was about I was a bit worried after reading reviews on here after I had booked it   but my fears were unfounded  It suited our needs perfectly and others in our group commented it had been a very good choice  
positive; After being caught out in windsor at other cafes that look appealing but not good food I this time reviewed before venturing out and came across this gem  It would not be a place I would normally enter based on appearance from outside only we gave it a go  Lucky we did as great eggs benedict fresh juice and friendly service  
positive; We got to Bakewell late in the afternoon after a walk  arriving at   to find most tea shops closed or closing  Le Mistral were still serving tea and coffees until pm  Great to get out of the cold and rain  Lovely surroundings  friendly staff  good snacks and hot drinks  Good value deal on a large hot drink and pastry for 
positive;I had a very different experience to the reviewer below me on the same night  There was water coming through the ceiling from the men s bathroom but it was from the sinks not the toilet so definitely no raw sewage  However  despite the fact we were right by where it was happening we really didn t know anything was wrong until we spoke to the waiter after he apologized for our food being a bit late    The flooding was an unfortunate and unavoidable accident but I actually thought they handled it very well  They lost  covers that night because couldn t use part of the seating area and our food did take a little longer but when it arrived it was fabulous  Our waiter was efficient and friendly  the live music was great and we had a lovely night  Goodness knows how good it would be when there had not been a problem    All in all an excellent night that because of the good handling of the situation was not ruined  I do feel for the people they had to send away who had booked but not sure what else they could do  People need to learn that sometimes things go wrong it is nobody s fault  We also appreciated the free cocktail at the end to say sorry for our inconvenience  although we hadn t actually felt inconvenienced at all  Well done Havana and we will be back 
positive; Went today for the first time with my husband  he had a waffle and I had a sundae  Both were delicious  The service was fine and we will definitely be back 
positive; Lovely food and great service  In a great location for other bars etc and a lovely setting inside   Would have been nice if the waiter taking our bill asked us if we wanted to pay the discretionary service charge or not though  Usually we d prefer to leave a tip in cash to make sure he staff get it but he put the full amount in the card machine without asking   a tad rude considering it is discretionary  
positive; Chose to eat off the menu as one family member is vegetarian and didn t see much to interest her on the buffet  Generous portions  One dish was disappointing   lamb shank   It was served with peas and carrots in gravy that looked like an English dinner instead of spiced Middle Eastern food that I was expecting  The rice on the same plate was beautifully seasoned with cardamom and black peppercorns  We were given free mint tea and some desserts  When we explained that  out of  of us didn t like coconut the waiter provided a plate of warm pastries which were excellent  
positive; Really enjoyed the food  the portions were really good and great offer on Saturday lunchtime of  courses for    See attached photos   Only comment I would say is would like the staff to say what is off the menu when they hand you it  just I asked for pan haggerty and was told it was off the menu   I will be back though as really want to try the beef with horseradish dumplings as wasn t on the menu when I went  
positive; This is our second visit here  we stumbled upon it last year and had a lovely evening so we searched for it again this year when we visited the Eden Project  The pub is a traditional no frills affair and not particularly trying to be a gastropub in its presentation  That said  the food was  on both of our visits  excellent and we just can t fault the friendliness of the staff  It feels like our local even though we ve only been twice  My teenage sons have asked that we recommend the ribs  they were melt in the mouth divine    
positive; A very good menu for families with a excellent choice at reasonable prices  Family entertainment most evenings   a lovely outdoor seating area 
positive; We were travelling to Bristol as part of our holiday and decided to pop into Zizzi as we have previously enjoyed their food in other branches  There was an issue with our starters in that the fryer broke part way through  however the man who I can only assume was the manager came over and offered us alternative starters complimentary for the inconvenience which was good  The rest of the meal was all really tasty  No faults with the food we received  The front of house staff were all excellent and I believe a real credit to the company as they made what could have been a terrible experience a really good one  
positive; I have visited several times over the years and the quality remains the same  The carvery is quite tasty and very filling  It is not  haute cuisine   but is good for this type of family pub  If you do not have young children make sure you are seated in the quiet area as the family area can be very noisy and children constantly run back and forth from the play area which does not lend itself to a relaxing meal  We had a birthday celebration there for my elderly mum and the whole family  people  were catered for efficiently   everyone enjoyed their food as the choices are varied  The pub also has special nights devoted to different foods  eg  Curry  Fish  Chips etc   I haven t tried this but I m sure they will be tasty and good value for money  
positive;I was there for few drinks   it was so busy but the smell of the wine around the atmosphere was lovely 
positive;This was mine and my husbands first visit and we had a wonderful evening  The host and staff were very friendly and efficient   The new chef we were advised had just joined from London and the food was excellent  The restaurant was modern   warm and welcoming and we will definitely be going again  
positive;Visited The Little Dessert Shop on a Friday night around :pm  Were very wary because of the awful reviews we had read but were very surprised at the lovely service we had so will be coming back :    Yes   there is often a queue out the door  but don t be deceived  This is because where you wait to be seated is right by the door  so pretty much   people can stand inside waiting before you are out the door  So don t be fooled by people raging about the out of door queue    We were greeted and sat within  mins of arriving   something which we were shocked at  We were handed menus  rather shabby looking and could do with a fresh set  and asked if we had been before  We we said no the process of ordering was explained to us  simple and easy    Once we had decided what we wanted my boyfriend went to the till to order  He was stood ordering for around   minutes which was frustrating   but could be due to the fact we built our own desserts and then the person on the till got the order wrong and had to start again  Perhaps needed somebody more professionally trained on tills on a Friday night   Our desserts came in less than tens mins once my boyfriend had returned and were large and delicious and well worth the money  Only issue we had was that mine came out around  mins before my boyfriends  and because I didn t want to eat without him left mine slightly cold  Better organisation would have solved that simply    We noticed that the manager was stood by our table and pointing and delegated orders to staff  that we already rushed off their feet  rather than doing it himself  Looked very cocky and unprofessional    When our plates were cleared the girl was lovely enough but just said  quot Were they nice  quot  rather than asking us how they were and seemed slightly unprofessional again  Didn t spoil the experience though   Overall this was a good experience  in  out and served in  mins  Better managerial and organisation would sort the restaurant out a treat and make it a very successful business  Will come back in the future 
positive; Me and my Partner visited the pub as a recommendation  He had the Lamb and mint pie and i had the Steak  Very well presented  the food was hot and tasted amazing  Will defiantly go back  
positive; We enjoyed our stop at this busy cafe for lunch   the Cornish pastries in particular were delicious  Hoping to save room for the apple pie next time  
positive; We first came to The Royal Oak in August  for lunch with some friends  It was a beautiful sunny day and the setting is lovely   one of the biggest village greens in England  We had a lovely meal and said we would come back   We returned on  November with my sister and her husband   it was our treat for my brother law s birthday  This time a chilly evening and the interior of the pub is cosy and old   perfect for a late autumn winter s night  Once again the food was very good and everyone was delighted  Our slight reservation was the size of the starters   three scallops was a bit stingy we felt  But otherwise  the taste and quality were excellent    It isn t the cheapest place around  but the service was friendly and helpful and the food was really pretty good  We would definitely go back  
positive; Been  times now and hopefully many more  Food is good and nacho s are nice and spicy  Staff very friendly and service good  Fantastic range of cocktails  Portions are big and our granddaughter loves the ribs and highly recommends them  Also good selection for vegetarians  Booking is a must at weekends as very popular  Well worth a visit  
positive; Overpriced and average nibbles  but the wonderful ambience makes up for it  Loved the Christmas theme  decor and carols  Sort of thing you only ever do once  I organised this as a gift for my mum and aunt and was very disappointed when the menus on the table actually had the price of the event on  Spoilt it a bit for my relatives as they felt guilty about the cost throughout the whole afternoon  
positive; The most fantastic lunch  Great service and food  We were a large party  +  Good selection of food  I had the courgette flower for starter  that fresh it was picked from the garden just after I ordered  Roast looked great  Not a great selection of veggie food  The garden is lovely  We have been in December too and the cosy feel in the bar is great too  Local pub but made to feel very welcome 
positive; I ve been twice this year for lunch with my husband and friends to celebrate birthdays  Both times the food and service were good and we had a very enjoyable time  
positive; Pub bar looked a bit tired however restaurant was okay  Two course meal for   is a great deal  good portions and tasty meals  Service was good and we were greeted by friendly staff  
positive; very good meal service    ideal for all the family    resonable prices  portions are good too value for money    
positive; We all love eating here the staff  food  location and surroundings are wonderful and very welcoming  The food is superb and there s something for everyone  
positive; Been here a few times now and i have to say everytime as been great  since being refurbed the place has really changed  staff are very friendly and inviting and the food is a very good price  pretty basic but nice little cosy and simple place to go 
positive; After reading some of the reviews post my visit for lunch today I wonder what expectations people have  In context I have eaten in restaurants across the world and for the money I found this eatery to be reasonable price wise  quality good and the portions on the large size echoed by the three chaps that I had lunch with who all like their food  We had a mixture of set and standard menu items  this isn t an a la carte restaurant where you need to be suited and booted  we dropped in off the back of the TVs shows and liking the types of food cooked in smart shorts and trainers  welcomed by the staff who were all friendly and attended to our requirements with a positive attitude  We come to this area most years and would definitely go back  The Goan curry was lovely  
positive; I have spent some time in Vietnam over the last few years and have missed the Pho since returning  so on spending a couple of days in Manchester I made a beeline for this restaurant    The Pho was excellent  I also had veg spring rolls  chicken wings and iced coffee which were all just as good as I remembered them from  nam  
positive; delicious food at good value for money prices   in a cosy environment with friendly swift service went with my mum and sister and her family and felt at ease  enjoyed quality time together  did not feel rushed to leave once meal was finished   would definitely return  
positive; Cosy little restaurant   lit by candle light  Good choice of food  portions are also good  Food we had on our visit was excellent   cajun salmon recommended  Good service and reasonably priced  
positive; Food was really good had bbq sharing platter but restaurant was freezing cold which was a shame if they could fix this the place would be perfect   
positive;my partner and I stubbled across this restaurant while wandering around Norwich  I was recommended a wine to my taste which I admit was gorgeous  very drinkable    we dined in the building next door to my surprise and you would have not know just by walking in  it was hard to choose as the menu looked lovely  but when we did the food was beautifully presentated  Although it did look better that it tasted  just seemed to lack a bit of flavour nothing shouted out at all  but nice still  before starting our mains a group seemed to arrive to dine after this its almost as every other table was ignored a bit  my partner ordered a drink before they arrived  but recieved it after they all recieved theirs which made you feel on the back burner  he then tried to get the attention of a waitress for a spoon but was nearly to the end of his meal before being seen too  one little thing i d stay  service could have been improved on this occasion and working in hospitality ourselves we know that our money is just as good as the next persons 
positive; Stayed here for one night   rooms are very cosy and homely  Very nice bathroom too  I slept really well   Food here is incredible   huge portions of homemade food  It is slightly pricier than your standard pub food but worth the extra bit of money  Pudding was incredible too  Not sure how I ate so much   Thanks 
positive; good food and nice place  the staff were friendly  all the food seemed good  including the desserts coffe   and steak 
positive; I love the idea of Bills   authentic  cosy and friendly but on a Saturday night I found it full up  good sign  but the tables are very close together and a little more crowded than I had anticipated   Food was nice  staff was friendly so in all  was a good night out  
positive; We had an early dinner with a friend  just happened to be in the area  We did not expect much and were pleasantly surprised by how tasty the food was  Mango Lassie was amazing   creamy  light  not too sweet  Paneer Tika  dahl  aubergines   I can recommend all we had  
positive; Went on spec as menu looked ok service very speedy and efficient fish and chips fabulous good pizzas and as it was a Monday night  for the price of  pizzas with a pizza box for the few uneaten slices  We also went back on Friday to get takeaway fish and chips very good but a bit mean on the number of chips in the takeaway portions  although the fish was again very good  Would definitely go back though if back on holiday in this area 
positive; We all really enjoyed our meal at this restaurant  The atmosphere was great and the food  whilst not ground breaking  was beautifully presented  The staff are delightful  
positive; I ve been to Sambucas a few times but only ever when the lunch time meal deal of  courses for    has been on which to my knowledge is of the hours of  pm  I have thoroughly enjoyed all experiences that I have had at Sambucas  fair enough it may not be best restaurant in South Shields  but what you pay for is what you get  I think for the prices charged the quality of the food is quite good  everything that I have had there I ve enjoyed very much and it has always been filling and good value for money to  I d definately go back to Sambucas again  the staff there are quite pleasant sometimes they seem oblivious to your presence and others they pace back and forth waiting for you to of finished  I ve experienced both and this is an area of weakness which could be improved upon  altogether though I do enjoy my experiences of eating out at Sambucas and I will continue to do so  
positive; My wife and I visited this restaurant for a pre theatre meal  We decided to try Byron as we both have never seen or heard of these restaurants before and thought we would give it a whirl   So glad we did Service  The service we received was helpful and friendly  The only downside was that they forgot to bring out our taco s to share  but the waiter was very apologetic and this item was removed from our bill and we are all human after all    Food  The burgers we both had were sublime    My wife had the  Shady  and I had the  Byron  and never had burgers like it  On ordering our burgers the waiter told us that Byron cook all burgers medium as standard which we both said was fine  he also said that they could cook to order if we wanted them too  For the price  they were great value for money  full of flavour and were presented exactly as described on the menu  We also tried the  Byron  beers which are brewed in the  Camden Town  brewery  Not a bad drop if we both say so   Overall  The restaurant was very well presented and with very clean facilities  a great night out if you are in central London 
positive; Good food speedily served  wide wine list and a great atmosphere  Music nights enhanced on Wednesdays by Loans Caroll  mistress of the Smokey ballads  
positive; We had a really lovely family meal at Black Pepper  We went on the last friday of the month in March when there is music so we could have a little dance  The atmosphere was really lovely  the food was very good and the owner was always on hand to ensure that you had an enjoyable evening   We have been to Black Pepper a few times and will definitely go back again  
positive; Our second visit confirms this really is a good restaurant  Food  service and atmosphere are all excellent  The Dover Sole and the fillet steaks were delicious  The home made creme brulee with grilled pineapple was great and Les thought it was so good to see it on the menu  
positive; Ordered lunch yesterday at my workplace  the food was yummy and had balanced use of salt spice   oil  
positive;We visited last weekend when staying in the adjoining Francis Hotel  Meal was fantastic  staff very welcoming and helpful and the cheese soufflÇ¸ is a must 
positive;Lovely coffee  good choice of food and very good service  Great value for York  Looking forward to returning 
positive;if you ask for no MSG they will take it out of their cooking which means it is freshly cooked  A nice change from cheese rolls kebabs and pub food  The ambiance is nicer down stairs than up but upstairs is good for large groups  Nice decor
positive; Having taken a while to find you I am pleased I persevered I found it a very nice experience my soup was delicious and hot I also had a Japanese green tea recommended did not disappoint good vibes in the tea shop can recommend will be back 
positive;Visited on a bit of a windy day with a few spots of rain added in for good measure  Loved the vintage beach huts that people could eat their food in    Enjoyed the food and would visit again 
positive; Had a table of  for a Christmas work meal  Easy to book  pay deposit and ordering form  When we arrived however the form had not been received so the server thought we needed to see the menu  Luckily I had taken a copy of the form with me  However  all choices were available fortunately  Food was nice  server was great in asking when we wanted dessert brought out etc  Overall very nice meal  
positive; what a breathe of fresh air when a pub encompasses all that a village public house should be  friendly staff  good varied beer with guest ales and ciders a varied menu and lots of different entertainent and a place where we all can meet   kit doesnt matter if your a football fan  a cricket buff or like racing pigeons  you will be most welcome  wednesday night quiz or Sunday afternoon Jazz  come along we have had loads of pleasant evenings here  
positive;Part of the Weatherspoon group this provided a good choice of standard pub fare well cooked and delivered quickly  The prices were very good and there were all ages dining that evening  The decor was ok and there was a seating area outside  The pub was busy but the staff were attentive and the food arrived very quickly and was hot  The pasta was cooked al dente not always so in pubs and restaurants  There was a wide choice of beer etc and a good dessert menu  A main course and a bottle of lager was under    I could have gone for the chef s special a curry at just Altogether a pleasant place and one a solo visitor did not feel out of place in 
positive; Found La Lupa by accident on the internet while looking for somewhere else and it was definately a very lucky find  The food was very good and plenty of it  the drinks were priced the same as any other restaurant me and my partner have eaten in and the service was very good all in all a very good night out and a miracle find as there seem to be very few Italian restaurants around that arn t part of a big chain any more  
positive;loved the views and great food  Bar area smelled fusty  but conservatory room lit with candles had lovely atmosphere 
positive; I like it  I like the venue lots  The food is lovely but I am not sure about sharing a main course plate I would have much rather preferred having to myself  Each to their own but it doesn t work for me because its not sharing type food but overall the food is really good and the service excellent  
positive; went here for my birthday with eight friends   most of us had retro menu very good  others had different steaks  We all enjoyed our meals  Service and value for money was excellent  We will definitely go back  
positive; This cafÇ¸ is a hidden gem with an old world atmosphere  Outdoor tables have covers to protect customers from the rain but the sun was shining when our walking group made a visit  The environment feels like a walled garden  with pots and pieces of old sculpture  The homemade soup was very good  The staff were friendly and helpful  
positive; We ve visited cafe shore this holiday and we found everything very fashionable  We just had some drinks nothing to eat  but I had the best coffee there  The atmosphere was ok  staff polite  I will definately come back in my next trip to poole and I will also try the food   
positive; great lunch  good food  staff welcoming  reasonably priced   Have had lunch there many times would go back 
positive; This cafe is in a pleasant location and the food varies from good to very good  Staff are fairly friendly but the wait for food in my experience is always incredibly long  I go back every so often because of the location and the food is good but the wait for food at times seems interminable and I begin to think that my order has been forgotten but that s just the way it is at Coast  
positive; Stopped off here after a lovely walk along sandbanks beach  Opted for the fish and chips although it seemed a little pricey it was worth it  The presentation was nice and the fish was very crispy and flavoursome  My only niggle was it didn t come with mushy peas  Great views of the beach  
positive; We have been there twice now and even on the first visit we were greeted as friends  Very relaxing atmosphere and attentive service  The children were made very welcome  This time we all had the mezze which had a good variety of tastes and was very good  I was offered the vegetarian selection  which was good too  My only  small  criticism would be the explanations of the various wines on the menu  it was difficult to work out which was sweet  dry etc  
positive; I have been there a number of times  Never been disapointed  Great food  excellent choice  well cooked well presented  service and staff realy good  Definitly recomend it  
positive; We were visiting Wareham with a friend and were suitably impressed by the welcome  service and above all the food  We had a lovely relaxed meal in great surroundings  
positive; We had superb meals   enormous prawn salads    The staff are always helpful and willing to change parts of the menu to suit when relatives visit we always make at least one trip here  The range of beers is very good and there is always a lovely friendly atmosphere highly recommended  
positive; There has been a bit of a dearth of good places for a light meal in St Albans  but the Bakehouse has changed that  As the name suggests  they have great bread  cakes  biscuits and so on  so make good soups  sandwiches and salads  I have introduced the place to various friends and they have liked it  too  The reason for only four stars is that it is rather echoey and noisy with too many reflective surfaces  otherwise great  
positive; We have used this pub frequently as a stopping off point on a journey up the A and have had snack or light meals at lunchtime and have always found them very good and no more expensive than many pubs like this  The pub has a large garden with a huge shady tree to sit under   excellent for very warm weather   We have always found the staff friendly and helpful particularly when we are travelling with the grandchildren   
positive; Lovely little find for a quick bite  Soup and sandwich was lovely  the bread is lush  rustic looking decor and happy to help staff  
positive; At the Lambs Green  Varied menu  lovely service  beautiful pub restaurant really enjoyed it  Main course  puds  wine other drinks for less than    @ head  Felt special  
positive;a really nice setting and the lunch was good  its a great setting the service could be improved as slow when busy
positive; As usual the food was lovely and ample A very reasonable deal at the begining of the week  Its a shame the venue is small but they usually fit you in if not booked  Be advised its best to book if there are a few of you  I prefer to dine upstairs as its not in line of the door being opened all the time Staff are friendly and attentive  
positive; We ate at  pm  our choice  but felt rushed and the young waitress didn t seem to be with it  we asked for sauces  as she never offered  and she said ok but never brought any so I had to ask her again before we got them  Saying that the food was good but very expensive 
positive;Took my mother and sons for Sunday lunch  Friendly response to email booking  Good atmosphere  lovely home tasting cooking and friendly service  esp Toby    Really delicious poached pear  
positive; Very good breakfast  Great tea  Staff friendly and welcoming but a really a long wait for meal to be served   Wouldn t put me off going again as food was great  
positive; visited newly refurbished and ownership of the Eddystone beautiful surroundings with sea views especially on a warm summers day  home cooked roast on a Sunday from a set Sunday menu  good service and prompt with food order  only recommendation would be to offer a selection of lite bites also on this day as not always is a roast required  
positive; I took  clients for lunch at The Hoy in Margate  it was fantastic  I had Scallops to start  followed by whole Sea Bass  Great to see Margate s revival  leta hope it continues to grow  
positive; We really enjoyed our food and service here  and cocktails   A great place to have something to eat whilst having a drink  
positive;This ice cream was very coconuty but I felt it was more lidl than Italian  Will try some other flavours though
positive; Cafe was busy and buzzing but service was good and queue disappeared quickly abs efficiently  I ordered a Ceasar Salad with chicken  the order arrived in good time but it was mainly made up of lettuce and croutons  I spoke to Ben one of the waiters about my meal and showed it to him  He was polite and helpful  and returned within a few minutes with extra chicken and cheese  I was so impressed with this service and how it was delt with I would not hesitate to return to Bluebird or recommend it  My partners food was good  Thank you Ben  
positive;I have tried Bella italia s in the past and never been overly keen   They aren t rubbish but neither amazing  Was on a trip with my mum to Liverpool and found the Groupon Deal so thought why not  Deal was  courses and presecco for  pounds for  people  Went in not expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised   The portion sizes were great and more than filling  The presecco was lovely   I asked for no olives in my calazone and they offered to put extra of my choice in to substitute   brilliant   Food was lovely   Staff was very nice and very friendly 
positive; Popped in as a little pick me up after eagerly waiting for them to open  I ordered an espresso and a flat white  because I m a greedy coffee gremlin  and loved the flat white with the gorgeous tulip development on it  It s a really simple place  good location  no fuss and the staff are lovely  The toilet cum bath was all brand new fittings and they are still renovating the outside area  Now I ve seen on Instagram they ve started doing breakfast and I can t wait to try it  
positive; Excellent food  beautifully cooked  Staff friendly   attentive but not intrusive  A night to remember  Thank you  
positive; I liked the food the service Only dislike loud television on for sports and lots of rowdy young men enjoying it  Nonetheless I will visit again its worth it  
positive;We dine at lunchtime   they had a offer on meals at    and cocktails buy one get one free  Which was great for us   staff were really nice and helpful   The food was lovely and good portion sizes  
positive;I ve visited The Wavendon to eat on a number of occasions  On our most recent visit  the menu had changed   gone was the tomato  mozzarella and avacado salad which I used to enjoy  This time  however I ate the risotto balls  which were very nice  as well as the fishcakes which were equally good  I ve had the duck salad on a previous visit  too  which I d reccommend  The ice cream served with a cookie for dessert is a nice touch  Only downside was that my Mum ordered the lamb and when it arrived it was cold  They did offer to replace it  but she declined as she didn t want to be eating her meal when all of us had finished  She ended up sharing my fishcakes and they took it off the bill  A shame  but we will probably return and try something else instead 
positive;Read that pub was under new management and had been given  star hygiene rating so decided to give it a try after having really poor experience about  months ago  I am so pleased we did  Lee the Manager was really welcoming and talked us through the menu  Food was excellent and really nicely presented  The portion sizes were generous and good value for money  I had the gourmet burger   a venison burger with honey bacon and blue cheese  this came with mushrooms  peas and hand cooked chips and was They had a selection of hand made deserts on offer and the banana parfait with chocolate brownie and toffee sauce was amazing  We will definitely be visiting again soon 
positive; Lovely US style diner which is a big hit with my kids  Very warm and welcoming owner  The front opens completely so great I a sunny day  Can get busy though  A more varied menu would be great  Kids love the burgers and milkshakes  and I love the bagels  
positive; Popped in for lunch with my parents as they had heard good reviews about this place  we were not disappointed  Very friendly staff  prompt service  lovely food and great value for money  We will be returning   
positive;On Saturday me and my friends came in and went upstairs to the bar and was greeted by a very happy young lad called Ben  He recommended two beautiful cocktails  a rhubarb one which has a fresh taste   The two Ben s working did a great job  good vibes being gifted out and a chilled out atmosphere which made the night a success  Will be returning soon 
positive;Bought for me as a gift for  people  we had an excellent fun packed night  with drinks and silliness  Staff were very accommodating and made us feel welcome  Snacks were provided along with free shots for everyone and then we sat in the bar afterwards joining in with the fun there   Brilliant night would definitely book again 
positive; Having lived in the village for a few years now  I was yet to visit the QoTT  It actually wasn t a planned meal   I m glad the previous place disappointed otherwise we would not have made the decision to eat here   You have to be sure your expectations are clear  the pub that previous occupied there was obviously a gem to the village  however times have changed   the change to the place is delightful  a lovely characteristic pub but with the option to dine too  It just puts a bit of a sophisticated edge on  quot pub grub quot   with all the favourite classics   at a decent price  especially for the quality you get  There certainly is no class dividing management  but friendly  welcoming staff    We had the oz beef burger which was perfect size for me as I feel sometimes burger can often be too over filling  but the portion size was just perfect enough to be filling  however I am disappointed in myself that I could not fit a pudding in too as they looked scrummy  The other meal was the fish   chips   the person I was dining with said it was the best fish   chips he had ever had    I would like to apologise to the QoTT for not visiting sooner   we were surely be back    
positive; Went to Dudley s this evening as a birthday treat for my daughter  All  of us had savoury pancakes  which were very filling and everyone enjoyed them  The girl who served us was very friendly and polite  My son had a milkshake  which was deceptively filling and which he enjoyed  my daughter had hot chocolate with marshmallows and cream which was also very good  My pancake had a small burnt area as did my daughter s  but it was only a small patch  so didn t spoil the meal at all  They had run out of tuna  so we substituted chicken  they had also run out of king prawns  but there is such a large choice that this wasn t a problem  Sadly  no room for dessert  The bill had service charge already added  so no need to leave a tip  Will definitely go again  
positive; First visit atmosphere is fantastic food is good  me and my husbund like it specialy indian curries all kitchen staff is good and helps us  i read comment above where they are mentioning about a guy with beard   that guy help us lot and given us fresh fried rice   and chicken tikka on our table   some people are racist or dislike  Dont listen them  People must go and try food  
positive;Liked the food and hospitality   Great fish menu  Nothing to dislike as prices good too but would have liked more sweet options as chosen option not available
positive; Sunday lunch menu was good food and service excellent only issue main meal served on cold plates so good quickly went cold 
positive; I lived in Didsbury some time ago and found the pizza Express in West Didsbury to be a constant in respect to good service  food and ambiance  I generally prefer something a little more bespoke than a chain pizza restaurant    I had the pleasure of a trip yesterday and found the same good standards across the board  The staff were helpful  the service good and my pizza was fab  
positive; Very good food  Patient and understanding staff   we were mins late for our booking and considered a  quot no show quot   but the staff seemed pleased to see us and seated us at the bar while we waited only about mins for a table   Service was flawless One waiter was happy to answer our questions about the hour cooking process of the steak and kidney pudding  I ate the Barnsley Lamb which I found tender  juicy and delicious   like a chop should be  My side of wild salad greens was an interesting alternative to the usual green salad  I recommend it as a side   My vegetarian companion was disappointed: he ordered the only non meat dish on the menu: fish   chips  However  his chips had been cooked in animal fat  This was thoughtless   insensitive  He was unable to eat them  and so was left with just fish and a tiny morsel of mushy peas   My other companion was visiting from America  She enjoyed her traditional English sweetbreads  followed by steak   kidney pudding  She d never eaten either before and enjoyed them both  I have had them before  and I think the sweetbreads would have tasted better fried in butter  rather than oil  They tasted like chicken nuggets   Deliciously warm  rustic  crusty wholemeal bread was continuously offered and enjoyed   The atmosphere and ambiance are within keeping with the style and tradition of the establishment  The evening felt more like a wonderful historic experience  rather than a meal out  We had a fabulous night and I would recommend this place to tourists  for the experience alone   Similar food to the same standard  but cheaper  can be found in traditional pubs   One weird thing happened: The smell of the grapefruit flavoured handsoap in the toilets was overbearing  When I returned to my table to eat  the fragrance on my hands overpowered the food  I had to return to the bathroom to scrub it off  but was unable to remove the smell  I have never had this happen before  
positive; Delicious great service beautiful atmosphere  Try book in advance for the main room much nicer although second room nice too  ambience is lovely in main one  The curry is so nice and they do it to your heat rating    love it me and my boyfriend were looking for a local reasonable place  Also the staff are all thai which is a good sign  Yumm  
positive;Food good and large portions  Nice atmosphere  Good choice of drinks  Friendly service  Quite expensive for a  pop out for something  experience but was enjoyable 
positive; Very tasty homemade cakes and cookies   good coffee and delicious soup  No wait  Then there was Rumplestiltskin 
positive; I always love a vegetarian restaurant because I don t have to worry about what I m ordering a a vegetarian and my vegan boyfriend will be catered for  Ultimately I enjoyed my food and would recommend eating here  There were downsides  Maybe I chose a bad day to come in but I felt a bit unheard  the attitude of the staff was helpful and kind but then we were left without our tea s until we ordered out a second time then it came with dairy even though we asked for the vegan option which seemed odd to be negligent about  Then we ordered are side that was also forgotten about then finally one of our drinks came when we were done eating  I was left a bit frustrated the entire time and found it hard to get anyone s attention  I ll take it as a bit of a bad day and I will go back because the food was really delicious and was priced appropriately  Maybe I ll get take away next time  
positive; Had a meal with a friend on a Tuesday evening  Restaurant was quiet  felt a little cold and lacked atmosphere  Service was good  The food was really tasty  Had a soup for starter that was meant to be hot and it was  plenty of chilies  Main course had lots of flavour too  
positive; There s plenty to choose from and the place is always squeaky clean  The staff always say hello and goodbye  In my experience they are always on the ball and the inclusive breakfast  served all day  is filling and tasty  The only thing I can fault is the sausages    I would happily pay an extra p for better quality sausages and bacon to be put on the plate  I ve tried most of the places for breakfasts in petersfield and I keep going back here  I ve never waited longer than  minutes for my food and go at least once a fortnight  
positive;truly wonderful experience  would highly recommend  staff very friendly  food very tasty  lovely ambience    thanks
positive; As the title says  the food was delicious  and there was just the right amount of it  Service however was a little disappointing as waiting staff were unable to explain to us what some of the less familiar ingredients were  or what some of the dishes were like  and one of our dishes was incorrect when they brought it to us  they did however allow us to keep the mistaken dish   We also had to ask several times for some water  Service aside however  the food was great  and we had a very enjoyable evening  
positive; good food  service could be more relaxed and engaging  would return nonetheless  Pretty pricey though but quality is there  Great deco and view  
positive;Tasty and filling food but get the special  course meal offer if possible as the main food at menu price ends up quite pricy
positive; The position of this cafe right next to the River Dart in Dittisham cannot be bettered  My family and I enjoyed our lunch there very much  The cafe is family friendly with dogs allowed too  The service was excellent and the food very well cooked  The only downside is because of it s popularity you may have to queue to get in during busy times  
positive; We had our two Labradors with us  so sat in the bar area   Leamne served us and the dogd  ensuring they had a big bowl pf water and treats  We ordered the chicken tandorri bloomer and it was a lovely taste  arriving quite quickly with a smile and friendly service  We  and the dogs  would recommend this as a brilliant place to eat and to take dogs 
positive; I m getting hungry writing this thinking about the slow cooked duck  The food here is very very good  All in a minimalist and laid back atmosphere  The wine is also top notch  especially given the very reasonable prices  
positive; A really good recommendation from trip advisor  Food was really good  well cooked  tastey and authentic  Only grump was the atmosphere  Even better food than the Poole restaurant rated #  The hum of the ice cream cabinet and the piped music didn t do much in the way of ambiance but the waitress knew her stuff was very friendly and the chef was charming  If you want a really good meal then this is the place to come  
positive; This is our local  we always get out Chinese from there  however we have the take out as to sit in is noticeably more expensive  lovely food  good price and the staff are like a family  very friendly  You also get student discount    the place is however beautiful and well worth a nice meal out  
positive; We booked a table for pm arrived a little early  but this was no problem  Our table was ready for us and we spent a lovely couple of hours drinking half price wine and cocktails during their  happy hour   The bar has a vey relaxed atmosphere  Bar staff where all very welcoming and helpful  Would visit when next in the area again  
positive; Really like the concept of the restaurant  The all you can eat meat is really good  different cut of meat  the meat is tender and you can help yourself to salad and sides as much as you want  Really enjoyed the experience and the service from the waitress and the meat server  Came for lunch and the value for money is good considering the quality of the meat offered  The only low point for me was the price of the free alcohol cocktails  being pregnant is nice to have the options however for a mocktails is overpriced compare to any other restaurants for a free alcohol cocktail for a regular one    Will visit again  
positive; Lovely hot food and they willingly made scrambled eggs instead of fried  We were all full and it kept us going until tea time when all we wanted was a hot drink  
positive; We enjoyed our visit here  It was a very busy evening  Luminere  but we were made to feel very welcome  I don t like very hot drinks   the waiter was more than happy to supply me with another jug of milk  none of your plastic pots here   The cake was LARGE and delicious 
positive;This really is the perfect place to enjoy the world famous Gurnard sunset  The food is very good indeed with helpful and attentive service 
positive; We really enjoyed the vegan nachos  super salad and carrot cake at this fun and quirky cafe  The service was slow  but I think it was a bad day   the staff were very apologetic 
positive;Relaxing  fantastic ambience  clean  attentive and pleasant bar staff  somewhat a rarity these days  unfortunately  Relaxing by the open fire with a pint of beer and a bottle of Presecco  feeling a bit peckish ordered some food  chicken breast with a lovely hot and firery sauce and for  you couldn t fault it  Generous portion  hot  presented well and very tasty indeed  There were three of us and we all throughly enjoyed the meal and just as importantly the surroundings   A very pleasant pub to eat or drink in or both  I would definitely recommend  If you want a lovely pub meal in a lovely setting then give this place a go  If you want to higher end food then try Andersons in Birmingham 
positive; A good attractive corner shop  Very modern and clean  Prices are high but food was delicious so explains that  Family run business 
positive;Mini break over three nights  found this fab little pub  very friendly and welcoming  clean and tidy  wonderful fires  super window to watch the world go by decided to have late breakfast one day brill and plenty of it  real ales well kept menu nothing earth shattering but enough and home cooked  Thank you for your hospitality and keep up the good work 
positive; We went there with friends last night  There was a set menu  courses for one price and  courses for another price  and there was a game option  I had the Guinea fowl  It was wonderful  My husband had the wild boar burger but was disappointed by the size and the fact it had items missing eg: salad and cheese  My friend had the beef which had more fat than meat  The Costa coffee machine wasn t working so we just had regular coffee  Failing that the starters  puddings and the surroundings and staff were very good and I would go again  
positive; This pub serves great food and drink  service is friendly  the atmosphere is lively especially at weekends and on Wednesday evenings when there s a great quiz  Children welcome too  
positive;A group of  adults and  children enjoyed a very nice meal  Staff were very friendly and helpful with the children s menu choices and there was a good choice of non traditional Sunday lunch dishes on the menu  I had an excellent vegetarian starter starter and main course that I d never had before  out of   and we all enjoyed the modern stylish and relaxed dining area  For me as the only veggie out of the group If The Crown keeps being innovative with the choice and flavours then I ll certainly return 
positive; Stayed as a guest of hotel so had evening meal here  Without % off it would of been out of our price range  Good was amazing and service was lovely my only tiny fault was I found sticky toffee pudding abit too salty for my taste   Would reccomend lobster ravioli and mignon fillet   beautiful cooked to perfect medium rare x 
positive; Fish and chip meal before visiting London Eye  Fish was nicely cooked and chips were crisp  Served quickly and hot  
positive; One of the best in Chinatown   cheap too    downfalls  They changed the chef last year and the food quality noticeably went down  The staff are really rude  they throw your plates on the table    Why do I give them a  star  There s no  and a half   I have been going here for over  years and usually LOVE it however since they changed the chef we stopped going as we noticed the quality went    I used to forgive the bad service because the food was so good but now it s not  
positive;Visited on  June with a friend and had a truly fantastic night  The staff are great  good customer service without being too much and good banter  Manager was friendly and helpful  The music was amazing  inobtrusive but completely fantastic  Could have listened to him all night  Food was very good and I am looking forward to going back again soon 
positive; Very reasonable priced meals served by friendly and efficient staff   The atmosphere in The Rose and Crown is always friendly  An attractive building inside and out and it s kept very clean  
positive; We recently visited this restaurant as it was near to our hotel and we had read good things on Trip Advisor   We were advised to have four dishes as they were large and the waiter wasn t wrong  We could only eat  thirds of them as we were full  The quality and presentation of the dishes was great however if the portion size was smaller and slightly cheaper you could order more and try more of the delicious menu   Service was professional and very welcoming  we will be back  
positive; This is a friendly local pub which serves good food  it was surprisingly busy for Feburary  always a good sign  
positive; Being right next to the multistorey carpark and a variety of pubs  clubs and bars  combiined with it s usual llovely food makes this a favourite place to eat in durham  
positive; I had the king prawns a la Knights and the seafood medley to follow  Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the sauces in both dishes were to die for  Just a couple of criticisms: the mushrooms in the king prawn dish were rather tough and the red mullet was a tad dry  The atmosphere was very friendly and the staff were attentive  Would enjoy going back again  
positive; Really enjoyed our meals very good menu choice looked good and tasted good served by friendly staff and a relaxed setting   
positive; I have been here twice now  I have to say the service and food were excellent  The staff are very friendly and helpful  The food is excellent and good value  Surroundings are very comfortable and relaxing  Will certainly be returning  
positive; This has been brilliantly revamped with quirky clever decor creating a nice atmosphere  I went here for dinner with two girlfriends  we had dinner  The menu is creative and interesting and prices OK  Everything was fresh tasty and well presented   I chose Cod that was almost too salty to eat   heavy handed chef   The only downside to this restaurant is that there is a problem with the acoustics meaning that once it is full it is so noisy that we could hardly hear each other speak across the table  Thus good for youner people who don t mind shouting at each other but not so good for a couple wanting a quiet night out  or anyone who doesn t have perfect hearing  
positive; Fair price nice food and service  always busy very popular  shame there is no free parking down the front 
positive; Really lovely place to eat and good value for money  Service was excellent  the food was delicious  We thought the wine a little expensive per bottle so didn t get any  but that was our choice  All in all a really good night 
positive; What a gem  Great food and service to match  Highly recommend  Stones throw from kings cross  Worth finding 
positive; We had a great meal  some dishes were loved by all   some loved by half   The portion sizes I find very large  so  adults and  child were overwhelmed by food  but at a great price and they will pack it to go  The food was fresh   you could hear it being cooked   and the hotpot was fantastic  where while it looks a bit shabby   you could go and pick what you want to cook in your hotpot from a fridge over and over  the fact that the Asian community eat here constantly is a great sign and while a few dishes may not be to the western liking it is a gem of a restaurant  I will take people here time and time again  I am more about the food than the dÇ¸cor it is not a pretty place or a place you would recognise but it is good food  the service is at time lacking  but only the odd time  I love this place    
positive;We were seated quite quickly though found it hard to get waitresses attention so waited  mins to order drinks  Food was lovely  great selection and all of good quality  Lively atmosphere  Very friendly staff  I was given a red instead of white wine and they changed it immediately  Overall  a good fun experience if you fancy something a little different 
positive; Go here quite a lot and itis abit of a drive away   We tried the takeaway and we was quite disappointed   The food was quite bland when it was described with chillies n spicy  also the rice tasted like it had just been microwaved and we hadn t received chips as we ordered we had another box of rice  we was looking forward to our food as it is always good been  it s rubbish being let down 
positive; Wonderful  I have wanted to eat in this very large  noisy restaurant for a long time  but whenever we were in the Mill the tables were always crowded  However  yesterday was sunny outside  lucky for us  and when we arrived at pm Sunday lunchtime there were a few tables free  hurrah    There were  of us eating  Service was prompt and with a smile from the young students who are the waiters  We waited in anticipation for our food that arrived quickly  The Gammon pineapple egg   chips  fresh brick style  was huge and filled the plate  Caesar salads with smoked chicken  Smoked chicken salad and Tuna salad all deliciously tasty  fresh   well presented  Unfortunately there was no room for desert but we did manage coffees and they were able to provide Soya milk for lacto free  I would suggest that they could consider Goats milk as an alternative to soya milk   There is a daily specials board in the restaurant as well as the menu  The kitchen and service area is large and open so that you can see what is going on behind the scenes  There is a good mixture of seating with padded booth style seats and very colourful chairs around square  oblong and circular tables so great for small or large groups  Yes  of course I will return  IF I can get a seat :   
positive; I had lunch there recently with a friend and the food was very good  there was a good choice on the menu with  or  specials written up on the chalk board in the bar area  My friend had the fish and chips and she said it very good I had the corn fed chicken and it was delicious  followed by coffees  The service very good and friendly  We will be going back 
positive;Lovely atmosphere  welcoming fire lit and friendly staff and a delicious meal  It was a great end to a long journey from London on a horrible dark wet evening 
positive; I went there last week with a friend  Very decent choices  I def wanna try the texas fries and the oreo cookie next time  I had a delicious Ribeye steak and my friend had the lamb steak  There is also a great range of cocktails  Nice decoration  
positive; This is my local  I ve ordered a gazillion times for delivery and eaten at the restaurant too  with a picky  year old in tow  I ve never been disappointed  Pizzas are great  pasta is generous and tasty  Delivery is always speedy and hot  Can t fault these guys  
positive; Lovely pub  with delicious meals  The potions were quite large so our only criticism was we couldn t fit in a dessert  
positive;Had dinner with my partner it had a nice feel to the restaurant wasn t very busy when we went  Although at breakfast it was jam packed  Food was alright nothing mind blowing but it was still a really lovely place and I would definitely go again 
positive; This was a last minute booking as all our usual choices were fully booked for Sunday lunch  so it was a happy accident that we ended up here  I think we got one of the last tables  as we ended up near the toilets and till area  but even here the pub was not without character   The staff were very welcoming of our  month old baby  although it s a shame that the only high chairs seem to be designed for much older children  Baby changing facilities are available in one of the ladies toilets   Food wise  our starter of snails was fairly straightforward but delicious nevertheless  My main of a mushroom open lasagne was something special  however  and my husband really enjoyed his steak  As our daughter was getting rather tired we didn t stay for dessert but they looked delicious  We will definitely be back  
positive; We sat outside on a lovely sunny day and enjoyed the lunchtime deal  Good for families  children s menu was varied and good value  Lots to choose from all round  No complaints  
positive; I love it when hotels and restaurants make some where their own  without trying to be too corporate or  by the book  I ve experienced too much of this recently and I must say how refreshing it is to finally visit my local restaurant in my own village    The decor is classic and for some people it might not be as slick as your Zizzis and GBKs but this place is not trying to be a chain   I was so proud to take my work colleagues here as it was our quarterly dinner and this quarter was my turn to choose the restaurant  Albeit the chaps I work with never usually go to somewhere as nice as this but the waitress and the matradee made no fuss and we had a lovely time   The food is excellent with a short but varied and confident menu of homemade portions  The duck was especially good and I cannot fault the puddings   Well done  I m looking forward to eating there again    Only one comment would be to have some more music in the dining room to liven the atmosphere a little 
positive; This was our fourth visit to Caruso  We went on a thursday night  and as the evening went on the restaurant got so it was almost full   which says a lot  The service was very good throughout the evening and the owner coming to say hello and collect plates is a nice touch  it shows a real humility    My husband had a  collosal  portion of potato skins with garlic sauce to start  he loved it  I had the king prawns in garlic and white wine sauce which was absolutely delicious   prawns nicely cooked and a great sauce  My only slight criticism was that it did not come with bread  so I couldn t mop up the remaining sauce    The main meals were a bit of a mixed bag  My husband had a calzone  as usual  and absolutely loved it  I tried a little and it was definitely delicious  I had a special   quot Filletto Rossini quot   Now  it is entirely my own fault that I didn t especially enjoy it as I didnt think to ask what it was  I just presumed it was fillet steak in madeira sauce  I hadnt realised that there was liver pate with it  so when I bit into what I thought was a very rare peice of steak it was actually liver   not a nice surprise if you are not a fan of offal  But  I won t blame the restaurant for this  I am sure if you like that kind of thing it was lovely    So  as much as we hadnt enjoyed this visit as much as previous visits  it certainly wouldnt stop us coming back  We will look forward to our next meal here   
positive; We like to visit the Red Pepper when we go down to Maida Vale to visit my daughter  It s quite small and can be draughty if sitting near the door  Wine by the glass is a bit expensive  but apart from that it s a nice place to eat  The pizzas are large with very generous toppings  Tirimasu is a great choice for dessert and comes in a lovely baked case  We shall be there again  
positive;Pleasantly surprised to find this gem of a restaurant on the edge of Besrwood Harborne  Lucky to get a table on Saturday night  Good traditional Indian food with a twist and licensed for alcohol  Highly recommend 
positive;We chose Bistro  for our only dinner in Bexhill after seeing it is Number  restaurnat on Tripadvisor  and we were not disappointed  The food was really great  I had fish pie while my girlfriend had one of the  different recipes for mussels  They have a wide variety of Belgian beers  from Leffe to less well known brands  I tried Delirium Tremens and was not disappointed  I would have given  stars but the final cappuccino was really not up to the standard  looked and tasted more like filter coffee  Perhaps I am being picky but that bit can be improved 
positive; A real hidden gem  A birthday lunch for  on a Saturday we were the only party in the restraunt  The food was if a good standard although begrudged paying over the odds for a tub of Ben and Jerry s  service was very slow but we were glad to have a leisurely lunch  Staff were polite and helpful  The view  however  was amazing and really made this a special occasion  Would definitely return for afternoon tea or just a coffee  
positive; Went with my mum and sister to this place a few weeks ago  It was clean  had friendly staff  cosy atmosphere  and the food was great  I had the chicken and ham pie and by jingo it was the best pie I d ever tasted for a long time  The sauce was creamy  but not heavy  just amazing  The meat pieces were plentiful and tender  not to mention huge  and the pastry cover just melted in my mouth  The additional hand cut chips were lovely too   Bit expensive however  generally  that s the only real gripe about my experience  
positive;We visited Jamies for my sons st birthday  The staff were very pleasant and very well informed about the menu  The service was great and not too intrusive and the food was excellent  A really nice feel to the restaurant   Great Toilets    The staff were also very happy to bring out a birthday cake for our son 
positive; I have the pleasure of eating here on a regular basis  I am immensely gratified that we now have a local pub and restaurant that has a consistently high standard of food and it s presentation  yet maintains a homely and friendly atmosphere  Whether popping in for a drink or having an evening with family and friends in the restaurant  The Stamford Arms is the quintessential English pub  
positive;Attentive service and lovely food  Tasty tom yum soup  spicy curry and superb beef  tender and juicy  in fact the best rump steak I have ever had 
positive; We popped in here for a quick bite to eat having visited a wedding venue nearby  The staff were so welcoming and the atmosphere very friendly  We enjoyed our food and only wish we lived nearer so we could visit again soon  
positive; We ate here back in September  and had a really lovely meal  We had been struggling to find a good restaurant in the area  but Matthew s fitted the bill perfectly  Our daughter managed to leave her toy mouse  and we were leaving the next morning  The  front of house  guy came in early the next day  just so we could collect the mouse   thank you  
positive;We went for the first time after a friends recommendation to celebrate my son s th birthday  There were  of us and we had a great time  The food was really nice  There was something for everyone  I would definitely return in the future 
positive; This place has an amazing atmosphere the staff are very attentive and very clued up on the menu  Had morning coffee and was recommended the bath bun with cinnamon butter  very good   Whilst we were enjoying morning coffee a lady was playing the piano which was great because it was not too loud so you could still have conversation  A must if you visit Bath  
positive;Myself and my husband come for lunch    Had the lunch time special  couldn t fault in anyway   It was lovely   The service we had was % they are very friendly   We also brought chocolate   Was all very good price
positive; Been here a few times now for lunch and its one of the best places in Gloucester for fresh and delicious food  The tapas deal is great  not only is it very good for value  but such a variety for all taste buds  I have had the beef a couple of times and its always been cooked to perfection  Service here is attentive and they are always friendly  
positive; visited this restaurant with friends and was pleasantly surprised the food was very good cooked to perfection and presented well staff very friendly and very helpful would go back anytime 
positive;Just returned home after an excellent teatime meal  Although disappointed that our first choice of ham  egg and chips had sold out  the chap on the table next to us had this and the ham looked fabulous  hand cut and thick   there was plenty more to choose from  We chose to eat from the teatime two for   menu  three of the group had fish  chips and mushy peas and one had half a roast chicken and chips  with the peas being replaced with salad on request The batter on the fish was light and crispy  and the chicken was well cooked and plentiful  There were at least a dozen other dishes on the menu  including liver  lasagne  parmo s etc  The portion sizes are very generous  we all have very healthy appetites   and all agreed the chips were gorgeous  chunky and homemade  The service was quick  in spite of being busy and the staff friendly and accommodating  We will be returning very soon 
positive;Beautiful restaurant  sometimes lack in service but amply made up in the delicious food  Great spot for family
positive;As a member of the Badger Group  I visit the cricketers once a month as we hold our meetings there  The staff are always friendly  I have also visited on a few occasions to have a meal there  The food has always been very nice  And  as a vegetarian  it is nice to have options other than  spicy bean burger  or  mushroom risotto  which are usually on restaurant menus  There is a nice cosy pub atmosphere and the pub is in a lovely setting  We liked it so much that we decided to have our wedding reception there next year and have confidence that the staff and management team will do a good job 
positive; went for a Sunday roast with me and my family and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the roast the meat wasn t dry   my children had the beef    wasn t tough and a large portion of veg especially the cauliflower cheese it was better than mine    Chef  how do you make the cauliflower cheese so creamy    
positive;Always a delight to visit the Palm Bay hut in Debden  I work on Langston Road which is pretty far away from home so it is always welcoming to divulge in my traditional cuisine  Lovely food and great customer service  Keep it up guys 
positive; If you want a really good sausage roll make sure you get it from Celtic Kitchen  They are scrummy and good quality sausage meat  Not greasy  
positive; Had dinner here a couple of nights ago  whilst the food was very good  there was no atmosphere  I felt they needed to put on a little music or something in the background  We also got told to wait outside for our taxi  as it was raining  this was a little annoying  Despite that  the food was good so would recommend for a quiet intimate meal  
positive; Price was about   for five adult meals with soft drinks  which is reasonable given the location and that  of those meals were with the full size cod  Not as cheap as many chippys in the area but it is a prime tourist location close to the river and RSC  Food tasty and lovely hand cut chips  nothing left on our plates  Service relatively speedy given the busy lunch hour on a sunny day    No tables to seat our group of  though as max table size is   but we were still all close enough together to talk  
positive; lovely food  very lively and very busy  staff were friendly and helpful  Lots of choice  Bit busy because of the popularity  but all in all really enjoyed our supper here after a long day of travelling 
positive;Always love this pub  great for drinks on a night out   equally great for breakfast   The vegetarian all day breakfast is so yummy  Lovely atmosphere as well  :
positive; Lovely cosy pub on the high street in Tetbury  food is good  great selection of beer and wine and really friendly welcoming staff   
positive;We had a late lunch here on a lazy Sunday  We strolled in without a reservation but were seated immediately despite it being quite busy  All starters were    and mains except steak were Good glasses of wine and desserts for under   meant this was a very reasonable meal   The food was delicious  I had good calamari to start  whilst my partner had carpaccio  For mains I had a great piece of sea bass and my partner had very tasty  if slightly over cooked  lamb  Generous portions meant we had no room for dessert  Brilliant service considering how busy it was  Perfect for dinner before or after a show at the Almeida down the road  We will be back with friends    
positive; Always consistently yummy  keeping up with modern times and the cocktails are amazing   I would recommend the salt and pepper prawns and the chocolate spring rolls  
positive; Authentic Italian food   serious competition for my mum s veal in breadcrumbs    Made even better when the head waiter came out and gave my Nonna an extra plate of squid  
positive; Booked our table over the telephone with the owner earlier in the day  he was very friendly and offered plenty of information on their opening times  We arrived just after  and there were a few others in but it was very quiet  there is some background music but everyone except us seemed very subdued  The service was absolutely impeccable  and the food was delicious  It arrived in an acceptable time and the main course portions were adequately sufficient  the crispy noodle starter was enormous  Will definitely go back and try the buffet at lunchtime or on a Sunday evening  in fact  the people on the table next to us booked to come back on Sunday  three days  time their sea bass looked fabulous too  not that I m nosey or anything   If I had to change anything  I think it would be the lighting  They seem to be energy savers in the ceiling spots and they give a rather grey glow  but you can t see it when you re up to your eyeballs in curry and noodles    Their website is here: http:  www gluaymaaithai co uk  
positive; We ate here last night for the first time since it s changed to  Cut Pizzas  The ambiance was good  and the staff were all very friendly and helpful   We were really impressed with the interesting choice of pizza toppings  and the one I had was delicious  but we felt that at    the  dirty burger  was quite over priced  Could have been improved by better fries  skin on perhaps  rather than just the standard frozen ones  and maybe a side of coleslaw or similar  Agree with other reviewers that it s a shame that the renovation hasn t been extended to the toilets  and the paintwork seemed a bit unfinished  we were told that this was part of the  quot look quot   but to us it just looked like someone had been a bit slap dash when decorating   Would definitely go back though   perhaps not for a burger  but really looking forward to trying more of the pizzas  
positive; The service was absolutely outstanding   all the staff were super friendly   efficient    They had a live band which were superb  we stayed   danced til closing    Pate starter was fab  truffle desert was fab but unfortunately the steak was really tough    very disappointing  especially when you are paying   for it    However  we will definitely be back   but will give the steak a skip   try something else   The lunch menu looked really reasonable as the evening menu is a tad pricey    But I must stay in conclusion that the staff made it a really special evening 
positive;I ve eaten here a couple of times and always loved the food and the staff are very helpful and friendly  However  on my last visit there were a few problems  One of the waitresses had her hair untied  was chewing gum and was not wearing an apron  as the other staff do   I have been a waitress for many years and would never have done got away with doing that  The place was very under staffed and service was very slow  I hope this last experience was an off day
positive; We stayed in a nearby hotel where breakfast was nearly   each in the hotel so each morning we eat out  We had a breakfast here a few times  not bad at all for the money  Staff were pleasant and helpful  
positive; Food is lovely and different  atmosphere of restaurant is great  Some waiting staff need more training and to be more attentive  bill was wrong  times  over charging for items  so always double check   Was given a good table and hosts were great  kiddies got a activity pack which was helpful and they eat for free :  
positive; of us went out for bank holiday weekend went to coast to coast and were served by kyle what ever we needed he was straight on it couldn t of asked him for more he made our night  We loved the jugs of cocktails and puddings   Salted caramel and banana pancakes were amazing  really nice atmosphere in there 
positive;We often walk into the village and have a most enjoyable sunday lunch in good surroundings  the food is excellent  especially the sweets 
positive; We had lunch whist enjoying the sun on the wonderful veranda  Everything was hot  tasty and served quickly  The staff are superb  The only thing to remember is that it is cash only    Could be a problem if diners do not realize this beforehand  
positive; Love the service and atmosphere here  Orders from regular customers are remembered and there are places outside if you want to bring your dog 
positive; Good service  delicious food   reasonably priced particularly if you have a voucher  Avoid the side dishes as they are over priced  for a few rocket leaves and a few Parmesan shavings   Would recommend the calamari and the rustica pizzas  Wine was good too Would have had a higher rating if there was ANY toilet paper in the ladies loo and they didn t bring your main course out when you are not there Should have asked if you wanted a break  
positive;We went to the Sun Inn for an afternoon drink and were tempted back at night for a curry  Monday night is curry night at the Sun Inn and it was worth the mile walk from our hotel  The chicken tikka was served with rice  a mini naan bread  pompadom and chutney It was tasty and great value for money   all curries    The owners were welcoming and friendly and we would be happy to return should we be in the area again 
positive; I love Pave   always enjoy the atmosphere   There is just something about the place :   The food used to be good however last time i ate there I didn t particularly enjoy it   however this was last summer so may have changed chefs since then  Great on a bank holiday monday to meet with friends 
positive;Staff were all welcoming  keen to chat and had interesting and informative conversation to listen to  The environment is pleasant and the food was good and hearty  A selection of their own brews is available either on tap or bottled to take away  Always busy  day or night and popular with both locals and visitors  Well done the Strands 
positive; First time visited  We had a lovely lunch  menu was reasonable  location was pretty  would be lovely on a sunny day  I do plan to take the dog with me next time as it is dog friendly  The service was a bit slow  but I think they may have been a bit short staffed although every member of staff was pleasant  The place itself is adjecent to Dunham Massey  which is a lovely walk down a short country lane and over a small bridge  
positive;I was at the Crab Tavern on Monday night with my friends  Really good location and easy to access  Along with the food that was really good  I really appreciate the service of Gabor  He was very professional and he looked after us all the time  We had some of the starters and main courses to share advised by him  as it was our first time there  I will definitely come back  Thanks Gabor for making our experience at Crab Tavern so great  
positive; The staff were very friendly and helpful  the decor is smart and modern and the food very good indeed  
positive; We went on Monday night and had the set menu which is excellent value at Really good food nice buzz even on a Monday evening and catered for my dietary oddity with a smile  Winelist maybe a bit pricey  
positive; A very friendly and comfortable place even though there was not a full menu because the previous day had been busy The food was excellent and the staff very helpful A small rustic type pub with a nice garden  
positive; I took my three grandsons on this trip on Sunday  We decided to try something different from a panto and we were pleasantly surprised  They had to fill in a colouring page which was judged later as we cruised  Santa got on the barge along the canal with his elf to the cheers of the children on board  He greated them all and spoke to each child individually as they sat by him  The gifts were first rate and the boys were delighted with what they got  All in all a very pleasant afternoon  We went into the garden centre and we were  blown away  by the wonderful display of Christmas thingsl  What a beautiful place  well worth a visit  
positive; Had a lovely inpromtu Valentines lunch  did not book just walked in got a seat straight away  Busy  lively and friendly atmosphere  staff busy but approachable and friendly  but no time for chitchat which would have been nice  Food great  drinks pricy but worth a trip dack again and again  
positive;We had a table booked for : and were seated promptly despite being ten minutes or so early  I ordered the oz rump with a red wine and shallot jus  with mash and winter greens on the side to share  Honestly one of the best steaks I ve eaten in a very long time  so tender and melt in the mouth I wouldn t hesitate to go back again if I had the opportunity  being a student it means saving up to eat here Waiters were attentive to begin with but it took a while for anyone to come and clear clearly empty plates  and considering it wasn t particularly busy this was the only downside   Other than that  thoroughly recommend  The setting with the fairy lights is so beautiful  and very romantic  Tip   ask for a table by the window  we did this and got a booth tucked away by the window which was ever so atmospheric and wonderful 
positive; We have been meaning to visit ever since they first opened  as we drive past every day  Had NO idea how big it is   looks like a tiny coffee shop from the front  but they have  covers in the restaurant at the back  and a pleasant outdoor seating area   Service excellent  friendly and helpful  We shared a platter of meats and grilled veg as a starter  which was excellent  as was the maltese sausage pasta and the burger  They can provide gluten free pasta but not pizza   Come on guys   please start doing gluten free pizza  If you do you will become my new favourite restaurant and gain  star reviews from me  Until then I ll have to visit the featureless chains like Bella Italia and Pizza Express  ugh   when I need my fix  I d much rather support your business than a chain  
positive; We visited on our child free date night  Lovely clean surroundings  Friendly staff and atmosphere  Good choice of drinks  The food was tasty and good value  We were stuffed after  courses  
positive; American food was really nice  nothing unusual and no surprises  ordered cornbread with whipped butter for the first time  very enjoyable  but portion was small  Cobb salad was delicious and plentiful and the other guests had the rib eye which they said was cooked to perfection   medium rare   What really swung it for this esatblishment was the attentive service  it was wonderful  We always had our glasses topped up  fresh carafes of water brought at intervals and an abundance of free signature cocktails was a real treat  We were made to feel special and the free champagne cocktail and birthday cake for the birthday girl was a lovely gesture  Overall a bit pricey  but when you add up the service  the ambiance and the good quality food  it was worth it for a special occasion  
positive; I visited here on Saturday for my friends birthday  What s cooking is a good pub food restaurant  My meal was really nice  Can recommend the chicken and bar by sauce with pineapple  The cocktails where also really good  Particular the mojito delicious  Staff where friendly enough :  I would return here for pub style food :  
positive; I have been before but my other half hasn t and as we have a  month old we try and find a balance between family friendly  and not being annoyed by mega horrible kids  This strikes the perfect balance  massive place so though busy did seem too much  Kids play area has lots to do and on one level with ability to sit right next too it so you can sit and have a drink without losing sight of toddlers  The food was lovely we had a ploughmans and and a chicken and bacon salad  The kids food was fab too  good price and excellent choice  When we knocked the little ones food all over the floor the staff where awesome and had fresh food ready again in five mins  Very reasonably priced  and we were full up  Definitely our new fave family place to go too  
positive;This is a restaurant that thinks a lot of itself  not without reason  because the food wine and service are good  We are rather idiosyncratic diners to whom the staff had to adapt  Once they did  the staff were very attentive and we had excellent service in a comfortable environment  We had an antipasti and a pasta of rabbit tagliatelle  excellent  followed by lamb and fish  with an ice cream and apple strudel and ice cream to finish  We had a bottle of red wine  all totaling GBP  service included  The wine costs a third of the bill 
positive; It was such a lovely evening that we sat outside  I had chicken burger and chips without the bun  This was a spatchcock whole chicken breast with  the  tastiest chips in a bucket  I ordered a side salad as the waitress said it  just  came with a small garnish  But I was then overwhelmed with greenery  Dessert was a salted chocolate torte  Mmm    The only slight downside was the ginger beer wasn t from a bottle but from a can and you could taste the aspartame  But if they could just stock up on the Fentimans to fix that  
positive;Very nice setting  Lovely afternoon tea consisting of a variety of finger sandwiches  warm scones with jam and cream and a selection of cakes  If you have a sweet tooth you will be in your element  I personally have a savoury tooth and could have done with more sandwiches  But wouldn t rule out going again  A very enjoyable afternoon 
positive; We had booked well in advance to ensure we could get a table here during our visit to Poole  The restaurant is very modern  but has a relaxed feel to it  We were fortunate enough to be sitting next to the window  with a lovely view of the sun setting over the harbour  The food  as expected was cooked perfectly   the Lobster Thermidor is definitely recommended  and the bread and butter pudding was to die for  The only small issue was that our waiter struggled to keep up with the amount of tables he was serving  and we were sitting waiting for over  minutes before we were given the dessert menu  Considering you are only allocated a table for a certain amount of time  I was a bit concerned  However  it was a really enjoyable evening and a lovely treat  We would definitely visit again in the future  
positive; We went to this restaurant with friends with no expectations  and what a brilliant time we all had  The atmosphere and the decor were different to most places we usually eat  and the food was very tasty and plentiful  We all enjoyed the burgers  unfortunately they had run out of hot dogs so disappointment for one member of the party  but the burgers and the ribs were excellent  We can t wait to go again to sample the hotdogs  
positive;I have eaten many times at Loch Fyne and the food has always been excellent and the staff friendly  In a large group or at very busy times there can be a bit of a wait though  and the lack of soft furnishings makes it a bit noisy 
positive; My family and I decided to try out a new restaurant as recommended by some friends of ours and booked an evening at Bombay  it turned out to be one of the best evenings we ve had  We were welcomed by a pretty waitress with glasses who kindly took great care of us that evening  she asked if she could hang our jackets  which most waitresses forget to do even in fine dining restaurants  and was extremely polite  she didn t take our orders though which was strange but she did mention she was new and didn t take our orders in case she got them wrong which was appreciated    I ordered a lamb shank was absolutely gorgeous  perfectly cooked and well presented  After finishing  our plates were cleared straight away    Overall  fab service and lovely food  
positive; Delicious curry with authentic flavour and a good value price tag  Chicken Balti was excellent both in terms of taste and quality of the meat  Dhal was particularly mouth watering as was the Prawn Puri  We ordered online and it took longer than expected for the food to arrive as it was a busy Saturday night  so I would advise advance ordering if you can at busy times  They were apologetic and gave us a free dish which was kind  I would definitely eat from here again  
positive;First time visiting and really enjoyed the whole experience  Lovely interior and a great bar for pre dinner drinks  Food was nice and had the sizzling king prawns with madras sauce which was very tasty 
positive; Went for dinner on Saturday night  Lovely atmosphere and nice decoration  The lighting is a bit strange but I guess that s all part of the design  Food was excellent  Lovely fresh oysters and delicious main course  We had the Tuscan sausage and the venison which were both very tasty  Only slight negative was the temperature  my plate was cold and food luke warm which was a real shame  The actual restaurant was also a bit chilly so I think the had forgotten to turn the heating up  We both wore thick woolly jumpers the whole time  Other than that  excellent service and v tasty food  Will definitely be back  
positive;Wahaca is amazing the food is just fresh and really delicous  went with a couple of frriends  and we just loved it we have also been to cantina laredo which is good but a bit pricy  Wahaca is a good alterrnative but with a more reasonable price   service friendly from lilina 
positive; Love this place  The decor and venue is really stylish  It is a large bar restaurant Great for meeting up with friends without having blaring music in the background  The food is well prepared and everything looks clean and hygienic  There was a wide range of food to choose from to suit all and the food was very tasty  The women s toilets upstairs are chic  The waiters were friendly and polite  The bar staff also seemed fine  No complaints  Would definitely recommend  
positive; Lunch on a Saturday for    each  don t know what s not to be pleased about  Service was polite and swift  Buffet offering was well made and varied  Seating area and buffet carts were clean and adequate  Good value for money  
positive; Went here on a recommendation from my now boyfriend when we first started dating  Set back away from the main thoroughfare amidst a concourse of takeaway establishments  If you did not know it was there you may miss it  It does look quite cute and appealing from the outside however so I did look forward to giving it a try   I had already seen the menu from their website  and if you are a girl after my own heart you may do the same as I love to see a menu before i visit the place  Inside was small  but well laid out considering the size and had a warm atmosphere  For a Saturday evening it was full but not cramped  and the waitresses were busy but never too busy to attend to our needs  My partner advised me to go straight for a main  which I begrudgingly agreed to as all the food looked yummy  He had his usual Pasta Carbonara  he is a regular at Il Moro  and i had Smoked Salmon Farfalle which was smoked salmon and peas in a cream sauce with Farfalle pasta  This  although at first appeared to be a small portion and rustic looking  was beautifully presented and tasted absolutely wonderful  I could pick out ever single flavour and my boyfriend also thoroughly enjoyed his  We were recommended a particular red wine  which we had a very generous glass each and we also had a jug of water  which not every place ices but Il Moro does  I was absolutely stuffed after this meal and practically needed to be rolled home which shows good value for money considering it is not the cheapest place around   Over all  it is a little gem and I think worth a visit for a relaxed  informal and pleasant meal  
positive; Needed a quick bite before going to see Les Mis so gave this place a try  It was very busy but they found us a table quite quickly  of us had a pasta dish and  had a steak all very very good   We all decided to have a dessert as they were soooo tempting all had something different so we could try each others  none of us wanted to share though as they were so nice    Service was efficient nice friendly waiter all in all would def recommend 
positive; Called in here after a show  food was good and served quickly despite being busy  if you like seafood I can recommend the mixed seafood special udon noodles  Reasonable price with device charge included  clearly stated on menus and not hidden as previous reviewers have commented  
positive; Great atmosphere  perfect for a few drinks and the  for  cocktail offer is a real plus  Beats the competition in Harborne  
positive; Wonderful place very resonable prices  Warm and very friendly  Popped in for a morning wake up  Will definately be back 
positive; We got a voucher for champagne afternoon tea as an engagement gift  We absolutely loved it and it was surprisingly filling  The only thing I would say is that there is a very heavy ratio of sweet to savoury treats  we usually prefer more savoury  but I think this is true of most afternoon teas  Lovely afternoon with an amazing view  
positive; Beautiful modern restaurant  book early and get a window seat if you can for great views over the sea   we went at dusk and saw one of the loveliest sunsets I have ever seen  Food was good and great drinks selection too  
positive; Second visit to this pub and it didn t disappoint  Decided on the three course set menu sunday lunch   wasn t going to have a starter  but the salt cod croquettes with tartar sauce sounded too good to miss   and they were  They were sensational    Main course was very good  fab yorkshire pudding  good quality beef with lovely roasties  carrots and green beans and a tasty gravy  If I had any feedback  and it would be very minor  it s that you could do with a few more veg on the plate    Lovely light dessert   blackberry jelly  custard and granola   yum    Will definitely visit again  
positive; I went to Sampan with some friends for a catch up and the food is great  The service isn t very good but the food definitely makes up for it  Very authentic and fresh and not at all expensive  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for take away or if you don t mind waiting  poor service  
positive; Meeting up with friends who you haven t seen for a while  You couldn t beat a pleasant view on a summer s day with great company and great food at a reasonable price  Pate with Red Onion Chutney was a lovely starter followed by Beer Battered Fish and Chips   sizes available   Great service and tasty food  Plenty of room inside but sitting under the parasols outside made it even more memorable  Would definitely go again  
positive; My husband had a steak and ale pie with chips and peas and left a clean plate  I had the goats cheese salad and beetroot salad which was tasty but a huge portion  
positive; only went in for cup of tea  lovely view over the sea but unfortuntely they were short of milk so tea was very strong 
positive; The fish   chips are really good here  you never get that horrid smell of mucky chip fat  prices are ok  very clean 
positive;Excellent value for lunch    courses    Great food   perfect accompaniment to trip to Kew Gardens 
positive;Nice atmosphere  good food at sensible prices  Always reliable service
positive; I have to admit that I haven t been to the venue  but my colleague bought one of their Signature Cinnamon Squares for me to have at work  I warmed it up as per my instructions and I have to admit that shortly afterwards I was in heaven  The cake was absolutely delicious  
positive;Great pub food with friendly service  Can watch the surfers whilst you enjoy your food   pint from the boathouse
positive; Stayed for three drinks when we only went in for one  Lovely atmosphere with candles and low lighting  Had some live music on when we were in their which created a lovely atmosphere  
positive; rd visit to Chicos this year and I just can t get enough  Tried both the mozzarella sticks and beef tacos my first visit  and haven t ordered anything else since  Cute  fun little restaurant  From October I ll be living in Leamington   no doubt I ll be dining at Chicos much more often  
positive; Eaten here several times and it has always been good  this visit was no exception  The food  service and wine are always of a high standard   the tasting menu gives a good selection  The dining experience ambience is relaxed and unpretentious  
positive;We had I lovely evening with big group of friends  The service was amazing  I was really impressed   Food was delicious and the atmosphere was very relaxing and cosy 
positive; Bought a deal from Groupon which allowed myself and my husband  courses from the  book of spells  menu  The place seemed pike a typical country pub until you enter the conservatory where it is a modern and contemporary eating place  it also displays art work from local artists which you can buy if you want  There were some lovely pieces I must admit   The service was good with attentive staff who worked hard the only small problem we did have was having to wait  minutes for coffee at the end of the meal  The food portions were huge but so tasty it was difficult to leave  The presentation was more restaurant than pub grub  The establishment has  self catering units at the back should you want to stay and explore the area which seemed like a good idea and reasonably priced  All very nice for a midweek treat  
positive; Nine of us went there for dinner last night  Delicious food and very  very good rose wine the asparagus with Parmesan was really good  Lovely friendly staff who made us very welcome  
positive; We took my  year old Mum out for lunch   stumbled on this place  and took a chance  Pleased to see they have a Tip Advisor excellence rating  The views all around across the area were excellent  It was warm  comfortable and busy  But the staff were very attentive  The menu was very interesting  including half a dozen specials that were only    We enjoyed the homemade faggots   We will certainly go there again  and we will recommend the White Hart to anyone in the area  
positive;We took our dog for a walk on Portmellon beach just outside the pub and popped in the pub on the way back for a drink lovely pub very friendly staff great for taking kids too and they except dogs inside 
positive; We live nearby and heard good things about the food so we decided to give it a try and I m so glad we did  We went before  pm when they do  meals for   and both had rump steak and chips  Both steaks were cooked as we like them which doesn t happen very often and the chips were fantastic  We had treacle pudding and custard which didn t look or taste homemade but was okay  The normal menu is quite pricey to go regularly and I would struggle to finish it I think but we will definitely be going again  
positive; It was a late rainy Saturday afternoon  Nondescript from the outside  Upon entering we saw it was packed  Waiting time was approximately  minutes before we were seated  No wine menu but was given the option to buy next door without corkage fees charged   From the clientele we knew that this was as traditional as you ll get    The vegetarian buffet selection is huge  Armed with a cm diameter silver tray each  we started dishing up  At a table spoon of each dish  the tray was full before reaching the halfway mark of the buffet   The food was tasty and flavoursome  Excellent value for money   To me the only negative was the metal plate  at least not plastic  Another great London culinary experience   Access is easy via Euston station    
positive;Nice pub with friendly staff  Went in a couple of times first being a Saturday night so very busy then again on Sunday afternoon  Good selection of food and drink with Sunday specials which were all reasonably priced   
positive; Enjoyed a pleasant evening with friends dining in this cosy cafe resturant bistro  menu offered a range of choices for either  or  courses at a fixed price  Wines available complimented the dishes well  Service particularly attentive and you felt real care had been taken to ensure diners were satisfied with their food  
positive; I have only been once but it really is a lovely place it s very expensive but the service was good as was the tea I was disappointed in the cake it was dry but it was the end of the day  I loved the farm shop but again the prices are a bit much  
positive; Visited here on a Saturday  Great quick and friendly service  Looked at the menu and the sausage and bacon baguette caught my eye  ordered food and drinks  Service was good and welcoming staff  The sausage and bacon baguette was really good  accompanied by Heinz Tomato Sauce which was perfect  Really nice coffee and overall a really nice experience  I will definitely be visiting here again soon  
positive; Really good food   another South West business done good  Luckily they decided to add Portishead to their list of cafe bars in the area  Consistently good  
positive; Fresh and delicious sushi  You just need to try the  quot all you can eat quot  option and it s too much food   For   per person all the sushi you can eat  Simply amazing  
positive; We stayed in the premier Inn near by  We ate here four nights on the trot  You need to book as very popular  The only thing I would like to say that is negative  because there was two of us  we often got put in a corner where I with only the entrance window to look at table   we got forgotten about as we couldn t see any staff as there is a wooden wall how about putting glass into this  I would have spent more money if we could get the staff s attention  In the end we just got the bill and went  
positive; Always stop for breakfast at Cafe Rouge when we visit Cheshire Oaks  The service is great and the staff super friendly  Rachel is lovely   The full breakfast is fab  but do try the pancakes they are so tasty even the version with fruit  
positive; Had a good jacket potato here after shopping in Hills   which was a very pleasant shopping experience  It has a good menu and nice views of the river  
positive; Thoroughly enjoy visiting The Tiger time and time again  Guaranteed always a very warm welcome  The new owners  family run business  are a great bunch and very friendly  The bar service was nd to none and quick  Looking forward to trying the meals but the hospitality chips went down a treat   Good luck and cant wait to taste the menu   
positive; Stopped to have a coffee and sandwich and did not regret it  The place to go for morning coffee or a light lunch  
positive; I felt I had to write a review after reading some of the negative comments  We went on a Tuesday when it was half price tapas so was quite busy  The ambience was great and there seemed to be plenty of staff  Our order was taken quickly  we did have to wait over half an hour before the first dishes came out but we were happy with this  We had ordered  different dishes which all came out within  minutes of each other  every single dish was delicious  We especially enjoyed the Chorizo al Vino so asked for some bread to dip up the lovely oil  unfortunately this did take a long time to come out  nearly  minutes  but because of this they knocked this item off the bill so can t complain really  Found the staff very pleasant and helpful  We paid less than   for the food so excellent value for money  Personally  can t fault the place and will definitely go back 
positive; Interesting building  good coffee and snacks  cakes not quite as good as they look  Doesn t mean i don t eat them  Staff have always been friendly and efficient  There are magazines and house styling books around for you to read while sitting there  A pleasant place to go for a tea   coffee  
positive; I enjoyed it  Would go back and if someone can stop the gulls trying to steal my food I d be grateful 
positive; Came here for brekkie after seeing it the night before  Really reminded us of the little diners in NYC  Yummy breakfast  Only wished there was table service  
positive; Went to Joe s on the off chance of getting a table  There was seven of us   children and  adults  eating and after a  minute wait at the bar we were seated  although we were originally told there would be a  minute wait   We were in time for Happy Hour and the adults each enjoyed a cheeky cocktail  We all agreed that one was not quite enough   The children had fun choosing non alcoholic cocktails from the menu and watching them being mixed  There was a good choice of food on both the main and children s menu  We were all impressed with the portion sizes and the burgers and chicken were very tasty  The extra nice service came when my  year old daughter told the waitress  who asked if she had enjoyed her day out in London  that it was her birthday  At the end of the meal one of the waiters came out and discreetly told my husband that they had prepared a cake for our daughter  but were having to wait to give it to her because they hadn t got any candles  so one of the staff had just popped out to the local Tesco s to buy some candles  We were very impressed that they took this time to make a  year olds birthday extra special  Our friend also used her gourmet card to get a discount at the end of the meal and this was accepted without any question  unlike some places we have visited    Overall the location is fab  just of the main piazza in Covent Garden  with a good priced food and drinks menu  We will return again  
positive; Nice little place for a spot of dinner  Plenty of choice on the menu and highly recommend the muscles  Couldn t resist a bit of pudding too 
positive; A good selection of cuuries which are very well prepared  The only thing that puts us off this restaurant is the size of it  It is large with no feeling of intimacy  If the could put in some partitions it would improve the feel of the place  Cant fault the food though   
positive; First time I have visited the new restaurant  but I think it is a lot better than the old place  Food was vey good  if not better  Pity there weren t more people eating though  I must say that I thought if the young Thai girl serving smiled a bit more it might make people feel a bit more welcome  I have visited Thailand a lot and thought they were a very friendly race  Shame  
positive;We recently moved to warwick and have tried out a few fish and chip shops but this is by far the best out of the lot  The portion sizes are good  The burger wasn t very good and I wouldn t be ordering that again  The chips were lovely and the sausage in batter was easily the best I have ever had  The fish my husband had was also amazing and was a large piece of fish    The price was fair  for fish and    for regular chips  Sausage in batter was a bit expensive at    but so worth the extra cost    Really enjoyed our food and will certainly be returning  
positive; I ve eaten here a few times and it s always decent Turkish food at a great price  Would always recommend 
positive; Went here for lunch last week because we wanted to stay local and was very pleased we did  We had the salmon done three ways with salad  delicious  Followed by the Eton Mess which was huge  Definitely going there again 
positive; I travel  minutes to go to this restaurant  I really enjoy the food  Great selection of dishes and you can tailor the dishes to your taste  The service is professional and the staff are welcoming   I would highly recommend Mint  
positive; Excellent food  fresh and tasty  We had dinner before seeing a play at the Arcola  The complimentary bread and dips were a lovely touch  I had hummus with roast lamb and pine nuts    excellent  Service was cheerful and efficient  
positive; Crumpets  known to me as pikelets  with morning coffee  Or scone  jam and cream for afternoon tea  What could be better and both are excellent at this small but friendly cafe  
positive; We expected our Christmas meal to be quite  quot plain quot  however  credit to them  it was a fantastic day  fantastic food and a lovely atmosphere 
positive; The service is always really good and friendly  the ambience is relaxed and very comfortable  the food is always good and very tasty  but a bit chainy   You are guaranteed to have a nice visit  
positive; Hubby and I both had the smoked  really tasty  only downside was no sweet potato fries  will defo eat here again  good quality tasty food  
positive; Enjoyed the atmosphere food was average service was bad as the place was busy and there was not enough staff on this was at a lunch time  
positive;We went here for lunch as recommended by our son what a change to this wee pub from last time so bright cosy cheerful for meals staff were lovely and food was nice wish I had tried carvery next time maybe good value and spotless clean  
positive; Loads of different flavours  we tried about  between us  All lovely  Loads of options  two different types of cones  cups and take away tube too  great value if your staying nearby    Pizza next door was very good  We had the cheesy garlic bread calzone thing  and Mexican  you can change toppings no worries   Offer dine in and take out  If you grab a menu you can preorder before you pick up  Good selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks too   Service  OK  They could try harder to be more friendly   Out door and in door dinning  take out  Highchair available  They heated baby food for me too  
positive; Following a night on the town consuming far too many alcoholic beverages the best food to eat is    Chips cheese and gravy from here  Works a treat when hammered  Not so sure how this random combo action tastes when sober  
positive; Was here last weekend and thought the food was brilliant and the meal deal with a drink total bargain    Food was tasty  well presented and served in good time  Wouldn t hesitate to eat here again   
positive; A good choice of well cooked  contemporary pub food  Excellent service and a relaxed atmosphere  
positive;Pret a Manger is literally on every corner in London  The food is quick  simple sandwiches  but they re really nice  Huge selection  although the first one we went to had hardly anything left after the lunch rush  It s always going to be easy  quick food though  Well worth it if you come at a less busy time : 
positive; Visited the Eyre arms today for the first time in a couple of years  It s just had a redecoration and a change of hands  The food was excellent as was the service  I had the piri piri chicken burger with chips  My husband had the steak and ale pie and he said it was delicious  The prices are what you would expect to pay in any other pub  We will be going back pretty soon  
positive;The quality of the food was very good and the portion sizes were generous  This coupled with the speedy and friendly service and very reasonable prices for a pint of Cobra mean we will be visiting on a regular basis  The  early bird  special makes for a very good value meal 
positive; We went here as a family for Easter Sunday  One of ys is a wheelchair user and everyone was very helpful  Easy parking  access and disabled toilets  Service was a bit slow but nothing out of the ordinary for a busy Sunday  Shame that not all the sides were available with the roasts but when we enquired about this extras of other sides were bought to us  Would definitely visit again  
positive; Went for valentines day  food was OK but nothing special especially for the price  Staff on the other hand    One guy came up to us at the start of the meal and introduced himself saying he ll be our waiter  can t remember his name  we ordered a drink and someone else brought it like  minutes later we never saw that guy again  at the end of the night there was less than ten tables left one poor waitress was running around bringing drinks and bills ect while the rest stood in the corner talking  That s the only person we saw more than once  what happened to the same waiter  apart from this girl who was very well mannered and looked shocked when we tipped but told her to keep it the rest of the staff need more than training to put it politely would go back but only because of this waitress I think her name was Emily she was lovely 
positive; I dined here with a group of friends    of us   on a Friday evening in early December  Service was friendly and efficient  and the staff were patient with the faffing about with the seating that a group sometimes causes  Food was for the most part very good  It was a fixed price Christmas menu at   per head for three courses  Quite a lot of choice on offer  I had the roast aubergines  the lamb shank  excellent   and the stuffed figs  delicious   My only real complaint was that the ground floor dining room is quite a cold room with big uncovered windows and the door does not shut snugly  so that there was a lethal draught blowing on half our guests for the evening  I would definitely give this place another go  but in winter I would recommend that you ask for a table away from the door or else eat in the upstairs room  The ground floor dining room is tiny and should therefore be cosy and snug  but it doesn t quite pull it off  
positive; In town for a conference  swung by tripadvisor  fancied Italian then headed here  Granted we turned up around pm and they were kind enough to seat us  we just had to wait a while for our food  Otherwise absolutely lovely food  I think the chef must be from Puglia as there were quite a lot of brochures for this area in Italian in the waiting area  I overheard him saying he refused to cook pizzas  I had the squid ink linguine for main and the soup for starter  Absolutely amazing food  
positive;we enjoyed a great evening with lovely local atmosphere and great food  We had a hake dish from a hard to choose from menu  Tasted great and presented well   if we had been there longer we would have had a return visit 
positive; Excellent food  excellent service  the staff are clearly very well trained but could be slightly less keen to whip plates away  
positive; Very good food and service highly recommend this Indian restaurant for a sit down or take away meal A+ 
positive; I eat here frequently for reliably good quality food which is immediately available  although they will cook dishes to order at your request   The first time I ate there I felt as if I were stealing as I wandered from country to country taking what I liked  Good fun  
positive; Went to marcos last night for the first time  Had a voucher as a Christmas gift  Nice relaxed atmosphere friendly service  Partner had ravioli I had king prawn both where delicious even though it could of been warmer  Will definitely go back 
positive; we live locally yet hadn t tried Yukti  I had read the reviews and so was expecting something very special  The service was attentive and very quick  If anything I thought the gap between courses was a little too short  There were four of us and we all had something different  I had lamb bhuna and it was lovely  I had the prawns and scallop starter which was gorgeous  The naan and rice lovely too  The portions aren t huge so we fitted in dessert  Also lovely  Not your average curry house and it was expensive   I suspect if it were in town it would be very busy and possibly even more pricey  The decor was interesting  Quite dark  The only thing that let it down was the toilets which seemed quite scruffy  basic and shabby  Not in keeping with the rest of the restaurant  I would definitely go again  
positive; I had visited this place before at the beginning of last year before going to the odeon and I really enjoyed the cocktails so decided to come with some friends for food  It was early evening when we went so it wasn t too busy  Although people did start to come in for what seemed like after work drinks  we were greeted and told to take a seat  looking around it seemed like there had been a few changes to the decor I really liked the new theme  it was a bit of a wait until the waitress came over but when she took our order she was very friendly and helpful  I ordered a burger and the waitress mentioned that the burgers are made in house  she recommended the smokin burger The food was gorgeous  the burger was massive and really filled me up definitely worth the money  The bill was settled with no fuss and we were thanked on our way out  Really pleasant visit and very pleased with the food  
positive;I wouldn t normally bother  except that I am frankly suspicious of the scathing reviews published about this perfectly inoffensive little place  It has been known for unscrupulous local competitors to write an appalling review  so I have to say I did wonder  I have been to the Rotisserie on numerous occasions  often before a concert or show  when needing something light and enjoyable  So last week  wife and I had chicken Ceasar salads which were delicious   very simple  no frills  but with meltingly tender chunks of chicken breast and a dressing that was just right  Very enjoyable  and they nowadays have a license  which didn t use to be the case  No cockroaches in the toilet  gents  which is admittedly small and cramped but perfectly clean  And friendly  helpful service from the beautiful waitress  Why people want to be unpleasant  I have no idea   this is a good  VERY reasonable eating place  keeping up its long standing standards  Bute street is a busy little place that runs between the Old Brompton Rd  and harrington Rd  You can sit outside  and it s quite noisy  but very nice if it s a beautiful day like last Thursday 
positive; It is my local Indian take away  Never had a bad meal  Delivery free or  percent off if you pick it up  
positive; There is a restaurant area but for a mid week bite to eat  food served in the bar is a good alternative  Service is more polite and attentive than most pubs  Food is better than average  
positive; Nice food  lovely service  drinks were served promptly and just the right waiting time between starter and main  Coupled with the beautiful view it made for a really enjoyable evening  Only one thing Table for two  Usually means it s either a date or a divorce discussion  Ours was a date  and we were so close to be next table  also a couple  that we were practically a table of awkward 
positive; The staff were very nice and we sat outside in the lovely garden as it was a sunny evening  The food was really good and I d recommend the lamb with a nice glass of Malbec  That travelled very well :    
positive;We were very well looked after the food was very good the service excellent they even managed to make up a birthday cake from chocolate brownies  Well done staff and a big thank you Sunday th April 
positive; I went with  friends for a lunch  The restaurant is bigger than it seems from outside  We like the atmosphere  The menu is a bit hard to read  However  the food was awesome especially the steak I ordered  Its chargrilled skirt steak with peanut and yuzu dressing   I don t remember the exact name   The dressing is just awesome and the steak is just nice  I would definitely go back again  
positive;I love going to the aztec  always end up spending more than expected with the  dip and dine  as theres not alot on the menu you could get for the amount they leave you  but food is delicious and worth the extra  in my opinion   nice indoor pool areas aswell as sauna  steam room and jaccuzi  aswell as clean and tidy changing rooms  the gym is lovely  very small  but perfect for me  and there is an indoor play area for the kids to enjoy with an area to purchase snacks and drinks  outside there is a lovely pool for hot days  lots of sun loungers and a great little park to keep the kids occupied  overall a great little day out
